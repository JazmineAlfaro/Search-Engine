    59	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
    60	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI.
    61	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
    62	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tTo Sherlock Holmes she is always THE woman. I have seldom heard
    63	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thim mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses
    64	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt
    65	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tany emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that
    66	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tone particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but
    67	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tadmirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect
    68	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\treasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a
    69	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never
    70	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tspoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They
    71	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twere admirable things for the observer--excellent for drawing the
    72	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tveil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner
    73	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely
    74	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tadjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which
    75	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmight throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a
    76	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power
    77	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a
    78	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and
    79	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable
    80	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmemory.
    81	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
    82	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us
    83	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\taway from each other. My own complete happiness, and the
    84	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thome-centred interests which rise up around the man who first
    85	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfinds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to
    86	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tabsorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of
    87	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsociety with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in
    88	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tBaker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from
    89	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tweek to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the
    90	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdrug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still,
    91	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tas ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his
    92	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\timmense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in
    93	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfollowing out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which
    94	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thad been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time
    95	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons
    96	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up
    97	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee,
    98	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand finally of the mission which he had accomplished so
    99	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdelicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland.
   100	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tBeyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely
   101	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of
   102	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmy former friend and companion.
   103	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   104	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tOne night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was
   105	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\treturning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to
   106	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcivil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I
   107	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpassed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated
   108	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the
   109	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tStudy in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes
   110	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tagain, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers.
   111	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHis rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw
   112	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against
   113	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head
   114	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who
   115	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tknew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their
   116	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\town story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his
   117	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdrug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new
   118	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tproblem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which
   119	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thad formerly been in part my own.
   120	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   121	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHis manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I
   122	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthink, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly
   123	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\teye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars,
   124	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he
   125	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstood before the fire and looked me over in his singular
   126	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tintrospective fashion.
   127	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   128	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Wedlock suits you," he remarked. "I think, Watson, that you have
   129	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tput on seven and a half pounds since I saw you."
   130	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   131	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Seven!" I answered.
   132	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   133	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more,
   134	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not
   135	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttell me that you intended to go into harness."
   136	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   137	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Then, how do you know?"
   138	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   139	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting
   140	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and
   141	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcareless servant girl?"
   142	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   143	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"My dear Holmes," said I, "this is too much. You would certainly
   144	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true
   145	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful
   146	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmess, but as I have changed my clothes I can't imagine how you
   147	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdeduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has
   148	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgiven her notice, but there, again, I fail to see how you work it
   149	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tout."
   150	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   151	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHe chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands
   152	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttogether.
   153	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   154	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It is simplicity itself," said he; "my eyes tell me that on the
   155	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it,
   156	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they
   157	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round
   158	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it.
   159	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile
   160	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tweather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting
   161	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tspecimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a
   162	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black
   163	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge
   164	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ton the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted
   165	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce
   166	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thim to be an active member of the medical profession."
   167	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   168	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his
   169	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tprocess of deduction. "When I hear you give your reasons," I
   170	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tremarked, "the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously
   171	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsimple that I could easily do it myself, though at each
   172	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsuccessive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you
   173	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\texplain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good
   174	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tas yours."
   175	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   176	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Quite so," he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing
   177	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thimself down into an armchair. "You see, but you do not observe.
   178	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen
   179	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe steps which lead up from the hall to this room."
   180	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   181	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Frequently."
   182	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   183	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"How often?"
   184	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   185	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, some hundreds of times."
   186	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   187	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Then how many are there?"
   188	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   189	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"How many? I don't know."
   190	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   191	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is
   192	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tjust my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps,
   193	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbecause I have both seen and observed. By-the-way, since you are
   194	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinterested in these little problems, and since you are good
   195	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tenough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you
   196	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmay be interested in this." He threw over a sheet of thick,
   197	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpink-tinted note-paper which had been lying open upon the table.
   198	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It came by the last post," said he. "Read it aloud."
   199	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   200	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe note was undated, and without either signature or address.
   201	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   202	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight
   203	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\to'clock," it said, "a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a
   204	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmatter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of
   205	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may
   206	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsafely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which
   207	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcan hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we have from all
   208	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tquarters received. Be in your chamber then at that hour, and do
   209	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnot take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask."
   210	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   211	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"This is indeed a mystery," I remarked. "What do you imagine that
   212	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit means?"
   213	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   214	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize before
   215	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tone has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit
   216	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttheories, instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself.
   217	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWhat do you deduce from it?"
   218	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   219	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was
   220	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twritten.
   221	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   222	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The man who wrote it was presumably well to do," I remarked,
   223	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tendeavouring to imitate my companion's processes. "Such paper
   224	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcould not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly
   225	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstrong and stiff."
   226	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   227	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Peculiar--that is the very word," said Holmes. "It is not an
   228	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tEnglish paper at all. Hold it up to the light."
   229	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   230	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI did so, and saw a large "E" with a small "g," a "P," and a
   231	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlarge "G" with a small "t" woven into the texture of the paper.
   232	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   233	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What do you make of that?" asked Holmes.
   234	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   235	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather."
   236	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   237	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Not at all. The 'G' with the small 't' stands for
   238	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t'Gesellschaft,' which is the German for 'Company.' It is a
   239	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcustomary contraction like our 'Co.' 'P,' of course, stands for
   240	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t'Papier.' Now for the 'Eg.' Let us glance at our Continental
   241	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tGazetteer." He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves.
   242	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Eglow, Eglonitz--here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking
   243	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcountry--in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. 'Remarkable as being
   244	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous
   245	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tglass-factories and paper-mills.' Ha, ha, my boy, what do you
   246	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmake of that?" His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue
   247	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttriumphant cloud from his cigarette.
   248	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   249	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The paper was made in Bohemia," I said.
   250	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   251	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you
   252	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnote the peculiar construction of the sentence--'This account of
   253	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyou we have from all quarters received.' A Frenchman or Russian
   254	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcould not have written that. It is the German who is so
   255	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tuncourteous to his verbs. It only remains, therefore, to discover
   256	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhat is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper and
   257	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tprefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And here he comes, if
   258	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts."
   259	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   260	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tAs he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses' hoofs and
   261	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgrating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the
   262	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbell. Holmes whistled.
   263	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   264	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"A pair, by the sound," said he. "Yes," he continued, glancing
   265	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tout of the window. "A nice little brougham and a pair of
   266	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbeauties. A hundred and fifty guineas apiece. There's money in
   267	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthis case, Watson, if there is nothing else."
   268	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   269	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I think that I had better go, Holmes."
   270	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   271	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my
   272	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tBoswell. And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity
   273	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto miss it."
   274	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   275	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But your client--"
   276	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   277	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he
   278	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcomes. Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best
   279	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tattention."
   280	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   281	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tA slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and
   282	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin the passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there
   283	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas a loud and authoritative tap.
   284	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   285	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Come in!" said Holmes.
   286	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   287	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tA man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six
   288	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His
   289	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked
   290	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tupon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed
   291	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tacross the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while
   292	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined
   293	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twith flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch
   294	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended
   295	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thalfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with
   296	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence
   297	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich was suggested by his whole appearance. He carried a
   298	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbroad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper
   299	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpart of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black
   300	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment,
   301	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfor his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower
   302	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpart of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character,
   303	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twith a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive
   304	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.
   305	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   306	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You had my note?" he asked with a deep harsh voice and a
   307	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstrongly marked German accent. "I told you that I would call." He
   308	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlooked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to
   309	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\taddress.
   310	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   311	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Pray take a seat," said Holmes. "This is my friend and
   312	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcolleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me
   313	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin my cases. Whom have I the honour to address?"
   314	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   315	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman.
   316	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour
   317	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most
   318	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\textreme importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate
   319	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twith you alone."
   320	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   321	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me
   322	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tback into my chair. "It is both, or none," said he. "You may say
   323	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbefore this gentleman anything which you may say to me."
   324	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   325	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe Count shrugged his broad shoulders. "Then I must begin," said
   326	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\the, "by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at
   327	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe end of that time the matter will be of no importance. At
   328	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpresent it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it
   329	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmay have an influence upon European history."
   330	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   331	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I promise," said Holmes.
   332	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   333	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And I."
   334	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   335	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You will excuse this mask," continued our strange visitor. "The
   336	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\taugust person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to
   337	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyou, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have
   338	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tjust called myself is not exactly my own."
   339	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   340	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I was aware of it," said Holmes dryly.
   341	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   342	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution
   343	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thas to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense
   344	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tscandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of
   345	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tEurope. To speak plainly, the matter implicates the great House
   346	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia."
   347	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   348	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I was also aware of that," murmured Holmes, settling himself
   349	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdown in his armchair and closing his eyes.
   350	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   351	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tOur visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid,
   352	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him
   353	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tas the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe.
   354	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHolmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his
   355	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgigantic client.
   356	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   357	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"If your Majesty would condescend to state your case," he
   358	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tremarked, "I should be better able to advise you."
   359	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   360	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in
   361	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tuncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he
   362	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. "You
   363	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tare right," he cried; "I am the King. Why should I attempt to
   364	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tconceal it?"
   365	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   366	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Why, indeed?" murmured Holmes. "Your Majesty had not spoken
   367	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbefore I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich
   368	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and
   369	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thereditary King of Bohemia."
   370	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   371	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But you can understand," said our strange visitor, sitting down
   372	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tonce more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, "you
   373	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcan understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in
   374	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmy own person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not
   375	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tconfide it to an agent without putting myself in his power. I
   376	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave come incognito from Prague for the purpose of consulting
   377	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyou."
   378	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   379	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Then, pray consult," said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.
   380	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   381	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a
   382	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlengthy visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known
   383	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tadventuress, Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you."
   384	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   385	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor," murmured Holmes without
   386	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\topening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of
   387	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdocketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it
   388	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not
   389	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tat once furnish information. In this case I found her biography
   390	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a
   391	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstaff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea
   392	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfishes.
   393	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   394	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Let me see!" said Holmes. "Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year

   396	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof Warsaw--yes! Retired from operatic stage--ha! Living in
   397	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tLondon--quite so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled
   398	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twith this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and
   399	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tis now desirous of getting those letters back."
   400	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   401	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Precisely so. But how--"

   403	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Was there a secret marriage?"

   414	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t

   502	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   503	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Certainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the
   504	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tCount Von Kramm."
   505	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   506	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress."
   507	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   508	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety."
   509	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   510	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Then, as to money?"
   511	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   512	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You have carte blanche."
   513	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   514	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Absolutely?"
   515	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   516	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom
   517	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto have that photograph."
   518	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   519	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And for present expenses?"
   520	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   521	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak
   522	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand laid it on the table.
   523	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   524	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in
   525	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnotes," he said.
   526	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   527	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHolmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and
   528	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thanded it to him.
   529	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   530	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And Mademoiselle's address?" he asked.
   531	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   532	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John's Wood."
   533	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   534	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHolmes took a note of it. "One other question," said he. "Was the
   535	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tphotograph a cabinet?"
   536	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   537	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It was."
   538	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   539	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon
   540	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave some good news for you. And good-night, Watson," he added,
   541	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tas the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. "If
   542	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyou will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three
   543	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\to'clock I should like to chat this little matter over with you."
   544	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   545	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   546	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tII.
   547	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   548	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tAt three o'clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had
   549	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnot yet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the
   550	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thouse shortly after eight o'clock in the morning. I sat down
   551	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbeside the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him,
   552	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thowever long he might be. I was already deeply interested in his
   553	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and
   554	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstrange features which were associated with the two crimes which
   555	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the
   556	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\texalted station of his client gave it a character of its own.
   557	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tIndeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my
   558	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfriend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of
   559	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a
   560	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the
   561	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tquick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most
   562	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinextricable mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable
   563	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsuccess that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to
   564	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tenter into my head.
   565	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   566	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tIt was close upon four before the door opened, and a
   567	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdrunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an
   568	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room.
   569	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tAccustomed as I was to my friend's amazing powers in the use of
   570	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdisguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it
   571	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas indeed he. With a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he
   572	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\temerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old.
   573	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tPutting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in
   574	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfront of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes.
   575	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   576	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, really!" he cried, and then he choked and laughed again
   577	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tuntil he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the
   578	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tchair.
   579	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   580	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What is it?"
   581	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   582	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It's quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I
   583	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\temployed my morning, or what I ended by doing."
   584	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   585	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I can't imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the
   586	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thabits, and perhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler."
   587	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   588	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you,
   589	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thowever. I left the house a little after eight o'clock this
   590	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmorning in the character of a groom out of work. There is a
   591	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of
   592	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthem, and you will know all that there is to know. I soon found
   593	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tBriony Lodge. It is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but
   594	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbuilt out in front right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock
   595	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto the door. Large sitting-room on the right side, well
   596	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfurnished, with long windows almost to the floor, and those
   597	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpreposterous English window fasteners which a child could open.
   598	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tBehind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window
   599	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcould be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round
   600	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit and examined it closely from every point of view, but without
   601	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnoting anything else of interest.
   602	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   603	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that
   604	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthere was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the
   605	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgarden. I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses,
   606	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand received in exchange twopence, a glass of half and half, two
   607	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfills of shag tobacco, and as much information as I could desire
   608	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tabout Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in
   609	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested, but
   610	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhose biographies I was compelled to listen to."
   611	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   612	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And what of Irene Adler?" I asked.
   613	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   614	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Oh, she has turned all the men's heads down in that part. She is
   615	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the
   616	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSerpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts,
   617	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdrives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for
   618	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdinner. Seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings.
   619	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHas only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark,
   620	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thandsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day, and
   621	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\toften twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner Temple. See
   622	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe advantages of a cabman as a confidant. They had driven him
   623	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thome a dozen times from Serpentine-mews, and knew all about him.
   624	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWhen I had listened to all they had to tell, I began to walk up
   625	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think over my plan
   626	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof campaign.
   627	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   628	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the
   629	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmatter. He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the
   630	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trelation between them, and what the object of his repeated
   631	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvisits? Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? If the
   632	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tformer, she had probably transferred the photograph to his
   633	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tkeeping. If the latter, it was less likely. On the issue of this
   634	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tquestion depended whether I should continue my work at Briony
   635	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tLodge, or turn my attention to the gentleman's chambers in the
   636	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tTemple. It was a delicate point, and it widened the field of my
   637	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinquiry. I fear that I bore you with these details, but I have to
   638	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlet you see my little difficulties, if you are to understand the
   639	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsituation."
   640	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   641	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I am following you closely," I answered.
   642	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   643	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab
   644	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdrove up to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a
   645	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tremarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached--evidently
   646	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe man of whom I had heard. He appeared to be in a
   647	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgreat hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the
   648	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmaid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly
   649	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tat home.
   650	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   651	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch
   652	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tglimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and
   653	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdown, talking excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see
   654	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnothing. Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than
   655	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbefore. As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from
   656	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this pocket and looked at it earnestly, 'Drive like the devil,' he
   657	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshouted, 'first to Gross & Hankey's in Regent Street, and then to
   658	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if
   659	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyou do it in twenty minutes!'
   660	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   661	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do
   662	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twell to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau,
   663	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under
   664	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of
   665	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe buckles. It hadn't pulled up before she shot out of the hall
   666	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdoor and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment,
   667	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbut she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.
   668	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   669	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'The Church of St. Monica, John,' she cried, 'and half a
   670	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.'
   671	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   672	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing
   673	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her
   674	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlandau when a cab came through the street. The driver looked
   675	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttwice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped in before he could
   676	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tobject. 'The Church of St. Monica,' said I, 'and half a sovereign
   677	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tif you reach it in twenty minutes.' It was twenty-five minutes to
   678	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttwelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind.
   679	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   680	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"My cabby drove fast. I don't think I ever drove faster, but the
   681	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tothers were there before us. The cab and the landau with their
   682	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsteaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid
   683	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe man and hurried into the church. There was not a soul there
   684	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsave the two whom I had followed and a surpliced clergyman, who
   685	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tseemed to be expostulating with them. They were all three
   686	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstanding in a knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side
   687	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\taisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church.
   688	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSuddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to
   689	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tme, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards
   690	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tme.
   691	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   692	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Thank God,' he cried. 'You'll do. Come! Come!'
   693	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   694	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'What then?' I asked.
   695	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   696	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won't be legal.'
   697	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   698	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was
   699	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear,
   700	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally
   701	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tassisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to
   702	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tGodfrey Norton, bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and
   703	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthere was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady
   704	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ton the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. It was
   705	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my
   706	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlife, and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just
   707	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnow. It seems that there had been some informality about their
   708	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlicense, that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them
   709	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twithout a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance
   710	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsaved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in
   711	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsearch of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean
   712	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto wear it on my watch-chain in memory of the occasion."
   713	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   714	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"This is a very unexpected turn of affairs," said I; "and what
   715	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthen?"
   716	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   717	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if
   718	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate
   719	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvery prompt and energetic measures on my part. At the church

   742	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t

   744	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t

   746	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   747	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I was sure that I might rely on you."
   748	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   749	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But what is it you wish?"

   751	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to
   752	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyou. Now," he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that
   753	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tour landlady had provided, "I must discuss it while I eat, for I
   754	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave not much time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must
   755	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbe on the scene of action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns
   756	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfrom her drive at seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her."
   757	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   758	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And what then?"
   759	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   760	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to
   761	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\toccur. There is only one point on which I must insist. You must
   762	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnot interfere, come what may. You understand?"
   763	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   764	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I am to be neutral?"
   765	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   766	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"To do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small
   767	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tunpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being
   768	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tconveyed into the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the
   769	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsitting-room window will open. You are to station yourself close
   770	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto that open window."
   771	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   772	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes."
   773	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   774	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you."
   775	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   776	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes."
   777	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   778	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And when I raise my hand--so--you will throw into the room what
   779	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of
   780	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfire. You quite follow me?"
   781	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   782	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Entirely."
   783	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   784	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It is nothing very formidable," he said, taking a long cigar-shaped
   785	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\troll from his pocket. "It is an ordinary plumber's smoke-rocket,
   786	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting.
   787	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tYour task is confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire,
   788	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit will be taken up by quite a number of people. You may then
   789	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twalk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten
   790	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tminutes. I hope that I have made myself clear?"
   791	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   792	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you,
   793	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand at the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry
   794	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof fire, and to wait you at the corner of the street."
   795	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   796	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Precisely."
   797	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   798	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Then you may entirely rely on me."
   799	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   800	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I
   801	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tprepare for the new role I have to play."
   802	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   803	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHe disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in
   804	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist
   805	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tclergyman. His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white
   806	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and
   807	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbenevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have
   808	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tequalled. It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. His
   809	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\texpression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every
   810	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a fine actor, even as
   811	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tscience lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in
   812	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcrime.
   813	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   814	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tIt was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still
   815	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in
   816	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSerpentine Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just
   817	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbeing lighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge,
   818	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twaiting for the coming of its occupant. The house was just such
   819	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tas I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes' succinct description,
   820	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbut the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On
   821	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was
   822	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tremarkably animated. There was a group of shabbily dressed men
   823	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsmoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his
   824	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-girl, and
   825	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tseveral well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with
   826	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcigars in their mouths.
   827	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   828	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You see," remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of
   829	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe house, "this marriage rather simplifies matters. The
   830	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tphotograph becomes a double-edged weapon now. The chances are
   831	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey
   832	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tNorton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his
   833	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tprincess. Now the question is, Where are we to find the
   834	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tphotograph?"
   835	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   836	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Where, indeed?"
   837	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   838	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is
   839	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcabinet size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman's
   840	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdress. She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid
   841	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand searched. Two attempts of the sort have already been made. We
   842	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmay take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her."
   843	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   844	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Where, then?"
   845	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   846	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But
   847	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI am inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive,
   848	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand they like to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it
   849	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tover to anyone else? She could trust her own guardianship, but
   850	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshe could not tell what indirect or political influence might be
   851	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbrought to bear upon a business man. Besides, remember that she
   852	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thad resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where she
   853	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcan lay her hands upon it. It must be in her own house."
   854	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   855	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But it has twice been burgled."
   856	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   857	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Pshaw! They did not know how to look."
   858	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   859	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But how will you look?"
   860	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   861	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I will not look."
   862	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   863	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What then?"
   864	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   865	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I will get her to show me."
   866	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   867	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But she will refuse."
   868	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   869	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is
   870	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ther carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter."
   871	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   872	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tAs he spoke the gleam of the side-lights of a carriage came round
   873	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which
   874	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trattled up to the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of
   875	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in
   876	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another
   877	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tloafer, who had rushed up with the same intention. A fierce
   878	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tquarrel broke out, which was increased by the two guardsmen, who
   879	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttook sides with one of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder,
   880	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twho was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was struck, and
   881	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was
   882	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who
   883	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstruck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes
   884	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but just as he reached
   885	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ther he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood
   886	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trunning freely down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to
   887	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttheir heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, while
   888	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta number of better-dressed people, who had watched the scuffle
   889	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twithout taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to
   890	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tattend to the injured man. Irene Adler, as I will still call her,
   891	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thad hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her
   892	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsuperb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking
   893	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tback into the street.
   894	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   895	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Is the poor gentleman much hurt?" she asked.
   896	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   897	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"He is dead," cried several voices.
   898	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   899	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No, no, there's life in him!" shouted another. "But he'll be
   900	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgone before you can get him to hospital."
   901	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   902	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"He's a brave fellow," said a woman. "They would have had the
   903	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlady's purse and watch if it hadn't been for him. They were a
   904	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgang, and a rough one, too. Ah, he's breathing now."
   905	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   906	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"He can't lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?"
   907	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   908	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable
   909	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsofa. This way, please!"
   910	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   911	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSlowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out
   912	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin the principal room, while I still observed the proceedings
   913	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfrom my post by the window. The lamps had been lit, but the
   914	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tblinds had not been drawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay
   915	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tupon the couch. I do not know whether he was seized with
   916	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcompunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I
   917	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tknow that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life
   918	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthan when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was
   919	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tconspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited
   920	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tupon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery
   921	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted
   922	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto me. I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under
   923	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmy ulster. After all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are
   924	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbut preventing her from injuring another.
   925	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   926	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHolmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man
   927	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twho is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the
   928	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twindow. At the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the
   929	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsignal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of "Fire!" The
   930	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tword was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of
   931	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tspectators, well dressed and ill--gentlemen, ostlers, and
   932	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tservant-maids--joined in a general shriek of "Fire!" Thick clouds
   933	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof smoke curled through the room and out at the open window. I
   934	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcaught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice
   935	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm.
   936	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSlipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner
   937	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my
   938	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfriend's arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar.
   939	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHe walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we
   940	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thad turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the
   941	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tEdgeware Road.
   942	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   943	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You did it very nicely, Doctor," he remarked. "Nothing could
   944	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave been better. It is all right."
   945	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   946	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You have the photograph?"
   947	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   948	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I know where it is."
   949	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   950	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And how did you find out?"
   951	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   952	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"She showed me, as I told you she would."
   953	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   954	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I am still in the dark."
   955	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   956	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I do not wish to make a mystery," said he, laughing. "The matter
   957	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the
   958	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstreet was an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening."
   959	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   960	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I guessed as much."
   961	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   962	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in
   963	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand
   964	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto my face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick."
   965	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   966	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"That also I could fathom."
   967	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   968	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else
   969	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcould she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room
   970	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich I suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was
   971	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdetermined to see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for
   972	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tair, they were compelled to open the window, and you had your
   973	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tchance."
   974	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   975	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"How did that help you?"
   976	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   977	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on
   978	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she
   979	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvalues most. It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have
   980	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmore than once taken advantage of it. In the case of the
   981	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tDarlington substitution scandal it was of use to me, and also in
   982	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman grabs at her baby;
   983	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tan unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to
   984	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tme that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious
   985	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to secure it.
   986	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were
   987	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tenough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The
   988	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tphotograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the
   989	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tright bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a
   990	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tglimpse of it as she half-drew it out. When I cried out that it
   991	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed
   992	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfrom the room, and I have not seen her since. I rose, and, making
   993	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmy excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitated whether to
   994	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tattempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had
   995	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcome in, and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to
   996	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all."
   997	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
   998	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And now?" I asked.
   999	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1000	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King
  1001	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be
  1002	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is
  1003	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tprobable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the
  1004	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tphotograph. It might be a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain
  1005	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit with his own hands."
  1006	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1007	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And when will you call?"
  1008	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1009	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall
  1010	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave a clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage
  1011	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmay mean a complete change in her life and habits. I must wire to
  1012	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe King without delay."
  1013	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1014	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWe had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was
  1015	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsearching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:
  1016	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1017	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes."
  1018	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1019	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThere were several people on the pavement at the time, but the
  1020	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgreeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had
  1021	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thurried by.
  1022	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1023	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I've heard that voice before," said Holmes, staring down the
  1024	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdimly lit street. "Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have
  1025	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbeen."
  1026	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1027	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1028	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tIII.
  1029	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1030	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our
  1031	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttoast and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed
  1032	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinto the room.
  1033	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1034	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You have really got it!" he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by
  1035	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\teither shoulder and looking eagerly into his face.
  1036	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1037	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Not yet."
  1038	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1039	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But you have hopes?"
  1040	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1041	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I have hopes."
  1042	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1043	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone."
  1044	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1045	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"We must have a cab."
  1046	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1047	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No, my brougham is waiting."
  1048	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1049	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Then that will simplify matters." We descended and started off
  1050	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tonce more for Briony Lodge.
  1051	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1052	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Irene Adler is married," remarked Holmes.
  1053	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1054	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Married! When?"
  1055	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1056	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yesterday."
  1057	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1058	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But to whom?"
  1059	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1060	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"To an English lawyer named Norton."
  1061	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1062	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But she could not love him."
  1063	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1064	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I am in hopes that she does."
  1065	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1066	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And why in hopes?"
  1067	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1068	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future
  1069	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tannoyance. If the lady loves her husband, she does not love your
  1070	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tMajesty. If she does not love your Majesty, there is no reason
  1071	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhy she should interfere with your Majesty's plan."
  1072	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1073	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It is true. And yet--Well! I wish she had been of my own
  1074	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstation! What a queen she would have made!" He relapsed into a
  1075	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmoody silence, which was not broken until we drew up in
  1076	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSerpentine Avenue.
  1077	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1078	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood
  1079	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tupon the steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped
  1080	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfrom the brougham.
  1081	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1082	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?" said she.
  1083	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1084	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I am Mr. Holmes," answered my companion, looking at her with a
  1085	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tquestioning and rather startled gaze.
  1086	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1087	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She
  1088	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tleft this morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing
  1089	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tCross for the Continent."
  1090	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1091	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What!" Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and
  1092	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsurprise. "Do you mean that she has left England?"
  1093	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1094	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Never to return."
  1095	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1096	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And the papers?" asked the King hoarsely. "All is lost."
  1097	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1098	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"We shall see." He pushed past the servant and rushed into the
  1099	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdrawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was
  1100	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tscattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and
  1101	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\topen drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before
  1102	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ther flight. Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small
  1103	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a
  1104	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tphotograph and a letter. The photograph was of Irene Adler
  1105	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\therself in evening dress, the letter was superscribed to
  1106	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for." My friend
  1107	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttore it open and we all three read it together. It was dated at
  1108	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmidnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:
  1109	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1110	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,--You really did it very well. You
  1111	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttook me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a
  1112	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsuspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I
  1113	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbegan to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had
  1114	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbeen told that if the King employed an agent it would certainly
  1115	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbe you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this,
  1116	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyou made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became
  1117	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsuspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind
  1118	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\told clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress
  1119	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmyself. Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage
  1120	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof the freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to
  1121	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twatch you, ran up stairs, got into my walking-clothes, as I call
  1122	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthem, and came down just as you departed.
  1123	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1124	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was
  1125	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\treally an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock
  1126	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHolmes. Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and
  1127	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstarted for the Temple to see my husband.
  1128	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1129	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by
  1130	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tso formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when
  1131	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyou call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in
  1132	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpeace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The King may
  1133	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdo what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly
  1134	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a
  1135	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tweapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might
  1136	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttake in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to
  1137	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpossess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,

  1141	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1142	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What a woman--oh, what a woman!" cried the King of Bohemia, when
  1143	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twe had all three read this epistle. "Did I not tell you how quick
  1144	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand resolute she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen?
  1145	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tIs it not a pity that she was not on my level?"
  1146	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1147	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"From what I have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a
  1148	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvery different level to your Majesty," said Holmes coldly. "I am
  1149	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsorry that I have not been able to bring your Majesty's business
  1150	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto a more successful conclusion."
  1151	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1152	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"On the contrary, my dear sir," cried the King; "nothing could be
  1153	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmore successful. I know that her word is inviolate. The
  1154	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tphotograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire."
  1155	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t

  1158	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can
  1159	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\treward you. This ring--" He slipped an emerald snake ring from
  1160	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand.
  1161	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1162	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Your Majesty has something which I should value even more
  1163	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thighly," said Holmes.
  1164	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1165	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You have but to name it."
  1166	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1167	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"This photograph!"
  1168	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1169	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe King stared at him in amazement.
  1170	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1171	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Irene's photograph!" he cried. "Certainly, if you wish it."
  1172	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1173	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the
  1174	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmatter. I have the honour to wish you a very good-morning." He
  1175	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbowed, and, turning away without observing the hand which the
  1176	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tKing had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his
  1177	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tchambers.
  1178	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1179	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tAnd that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom

  1181	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbeaten by a woman's wit. He used to make merry over the
  1182	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcleverness of women, but I have not heard him do it of late. And
  1183	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhen he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her

  1189	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1190	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the
  1191	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tautumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a
  1192	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvery stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair.
  1193	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWith an apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw when
  1194	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHolmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door
  1195	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbehind me.
  1196	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1197	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear
  1198	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWatson," he said cordially.
  1199	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1200	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I was afraid that you were engaged."
  1201	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1202	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"So I am. Very much so."
  1203	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1204	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Then I can wait in the next room."
  1205	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1206	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and

  1209	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1210	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of
  1211	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgreeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small
  1212	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfat-encircled eyes.
  1213	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1214	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Try the settee," said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and
  1215	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tputting his fingertips together, as was his custom when in
  1216	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tjudicial moods. "I know, my dear Watson, that you share my love

  1228	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary
  1229	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcombinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more
  1230	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdaring than any effort of the imagination."
  1231	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1232	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting."
  1233	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1234	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my
  1235	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tview, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you
  1236	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tuntil your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to
  1237	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbe right. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call
  1238	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tupon me this morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to
  1239	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbe one of the most singular which I have listened to for some
  1240	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttime. You have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique
  1241	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthings are very often connected not with the larger but with the
  1242	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsmaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for
  1243	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdoubt whether any positive crime has been committed. As far as I
  1244	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave heard it is impossible for me to say whether the present
  1245	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcase is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events is
  1246	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcertainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to.
  1247	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tPerhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to
  1248	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trecommence your narrative. I ask you not merely because my friend
  1249	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tDr. Watson has not heard the opening part but also because the
  1250	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpeculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every
  1251	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpossible detail from your lips. As a rule, when I have heard some
  1252	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tslight indication of the course of events, I am able to guide
  1253	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmyself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my
  1254	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmemory. In the present instance I am forced to admit that the
  1255	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfacts are, to the best of my belief, unique."
  1256	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1257	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some
  1258	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlittle pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the
  1259	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinside pocket of his greatcoat. As he glanced down the
  1260	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tadvertisement column, with his head thrust forward and the paper
  1261	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tflattened out upon his knee, I took a good look at the man and
  1262	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tendeavoured, after the fashion of my companion, to read the
  1263	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tindications which might be presented by his dress or appearance.
  1264	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1265	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor
  1266	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbore every mark of being an average commonplace British
  1267	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttradesman, obese, pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy grey
  1268	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshepherd's check trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat,
  1269	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tunbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy
  1270	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tAlbert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as
  1271	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tan ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a
  1272	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him. Altogether,
  1273	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlook as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man save
  1274	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and
  1275	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdiscontent upon his features.
  1276	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1277	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSherlock Holmes' quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook
  1278	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances.
  1279	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual
  1280	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlabour, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has
  1281	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbeen in China, and that he has done a considerable amount of
  1282	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twriting lately, I can deduce nothing else."
  1283	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1284	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tMr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger
  1285	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tupon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.
  1286	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1287	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr.
  1288	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHolmes?" he asked. "How did you know, for example, that I did
  1289	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmanual labour. It's as true as gospel, for I began as a ship's
  1290	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcarpenter."
  1291	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1292	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger
  1293	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthan your left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more
  1294	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdeveloped."
  1295	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1296	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?"
  1297	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1298	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I won't insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that,
  1299	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tespecially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you
  1300	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tuse an arc-and-compass breastpin."
  1301	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1302	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?"
  1303	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1304	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for
  1305	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfive inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the
  1306	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\telbow where you rest it upon the desk?"
  1307	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1308	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, but China?"
  1309	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1310	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right
  1311	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twrist could only have been done in China. I have made a small
  1312	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstudy of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature
  1313	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof the subject. That trick of staining the fishes' scales of a
  1314	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdelicate pink is quite peculiar to China. When, in addition, I
  1315	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsee a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter
  1316	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbecomes even more simple."
  1317	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1318	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tMr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. "Well, I never!" said he. "I
  1319	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthought at first that you had done something clever, but I see
  1320	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat there was nothing in it, after all."
  1321	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1322	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I begin to think, Watson," said Holmes, "that I make a mistake
  1323	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin explaining. 'Omne ignotum pro magnifico,' you know, and my
  1324	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpoor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I
  1325	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tam so candid. Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?"
  1326	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1327	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, I have got it now," he answered with his thick red finger
  1328	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tplanted halfway down the column. "Here it is. This is what began

  1330	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1331	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI took the paper from him and read as follows:

  1341	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1342	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What on earth does this mean?" I ejaculated after I had twice
  1343	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tread over the extraordinary announcement.
  1344	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1345	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHolmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when
  1346	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin high spirits. "It is a little off the beaten track, isn't it?"
  1347	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsaid he. "And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us
  1348	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tall about yourself, your household, and the effect which this
  1349	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tadvertisement had upon your fortunes. You will first make a note,
  1350	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tDoctor, of the paper and the date."
  1351	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1352	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It is The Morning Chronicle of April 27, 1890. Just two months

  1354	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1355	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson?"
  1356	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1357	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock
  1358	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHolmes," said Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; "I have a small
  1359	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpawnbroker's business at Coburg Square, near the City. It's not a
  1360	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvery large affair, and of late years it has not done more than
  1361	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tjust give me a living. I used to be able to keep two assistants,
  1362	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbut now I only keep one; and I would have a job to pay him but
  1363	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the
  1364	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbusiness."
  1365	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1366	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What is the name of this obliging youth?" asked Sherlock Holmes.
  1367	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1368	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he's not such a youth,
  1369	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\teither. It's hard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter
  1370	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tassistant, Mr. Holmes; and I know very well that he could better
  1371	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thimself and earn twice what I am able to give him. But, after
  1372	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tall, if he is satisfied, why should I put ideas in his head?"
  1373	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1374	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an employÃ© who
  1375	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcomes under the full market price. It is not a common experience

  1377	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnot as remarkable as your advertisement."
  1378	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1379	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Oh, he has his faults, too," said Mr. Wilson. "Never was such a
  1380	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfellow for photography. Snapping away with a camera when he ought

  1382	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlike a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures. That is his
  1383	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmain fault, but on the whole he's a good worker. There's no vice

  1402	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Why,' says he, 'here's another vacancy on the League of the

  1411	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmy having to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting
  1412	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmy foot over the door-mat. In that way I didn't know much of what
  1413	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas going on outside, and I was always glad of a bit of news.

  1415	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?' he

  1463	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstood as good a chance as any man that I had ever met. Vincent
  1464	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSpaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might
  1465	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tprove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for
  1466	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe day and to come right away with me. He was very willing to
  1467	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave a holiday, so we shut the business up and started off for
  1468	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe address that was given us in the advertisement.
  1469	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1470	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From
  1471	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnorth, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in
  1472	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement.
  1473	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tFleet Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope's Court
  1474	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlooked like a coster's orange barrow. I should not have thought
  1475	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthere were so many in the whole country as were brought together
  1476	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tby that single advertisement. Every shade of colour they
  1477	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twere--straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay;
  1478	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbut, as Spaulding said, there were not many who had the real
  1479	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvivid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how many were waiting, I
  1480	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twould have given it up in despair; but Spaulding would not hear
  1481	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and
  1482	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up
  1483	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream
  1484	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tupon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back
  1485	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdejected; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found
  1486	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tourselves in the office."
  1487	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1488	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Your experience has been a most entertaining one," remarked
  1489	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHolmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge
  1490	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpinch of snuff. "Pray continue your very interesting statement."
  1491	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1492	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs
  1493	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand a deal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that
  1494	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas even redder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate
  1495	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tas he came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in
  1496	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthem which would disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem
  1497	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto be such a very easy matter, after all. However, when our turn
  1498	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcame the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of
  1499	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he
  1500	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmight have a private word with us.
  1501	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1502	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,' said my assistant, 'and he is
  1503	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twilling to fill a vacancy in the League.'
  1504	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1505	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'And he is admirably suited for it,' the other answered. 'He has
  1506	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tevery requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so
  1507	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfine.' He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and
  1508	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he
  1509	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tplunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my
  1510	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsuccess.
  1511	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1512	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'It would be injustice to hesitate,' said he. 'You will,
  1513	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thowever, I am sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.'
  1514	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWith that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I
  1515	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyelled with the pain. 'There is water in your eyes,' said he as
  1516	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\the released me. 'I perceive that all is as it should be. But we
  1517	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave to be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and
  1518	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tonce by paint. I could tell you tales of cobbler's wax which
  1519	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twould disgust you with human nature.' He stepped over to the
  1520	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twindow and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the
  1521	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from below,
  1522	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand the folk all trooped away in different directions until there
  1523	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the
  1524	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmanager.

  1526	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'My name,' said he, 'is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of

  1535	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsorry to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the
  1536	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpropagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their
  1537	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmaintenance. It is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a

  1539	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1540	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was

  1542	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta few minutes he said that it would be all right.

  1606	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tobject might be I could not imagine. It seemed altogether past
  1607	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbelief that anyone could make such a will, or that they would pay
  1608	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsuch a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the
  1609	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t'Encyclopaedia Britannica.' Vincent Spaulding did what he could to
  1610	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcheer me up, but by bedtime I had reasoned myself out of the
  1611	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhole thing. However, in the morning I determined to have a look
  1612	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tat it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle of ink, and with a
  1613	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tquill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I started off for
  1614	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tPope's Court.
  1615	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1616	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as

  1618	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas there to see that I got fairly to work. He started me off
  1619	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tupon the letter A, and then he left me; but he would drop in from
  1620	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttime to time to see that all was right with me. At two o'clock he
  1621	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbade me good-day, complimented me upon the amount that I had
  1622	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twritten, and locked the door of the office after me.
  1623	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1624	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the
  1625	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmanager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my
  1626	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tweek's work. It was the same next week, and the same the week
  1627	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tafter. Every morning I was there at ten, and every afternoon I

  1629	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tonce of a morning, and then, after a time, he did not come in at
  1630	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tall. Still, of course, I never dared to leave the room for an
  1631	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinstant, for I was not sure when he might come, and the billet
  1632	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would not risk

  1661	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trueful face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so
  1662	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcompletely overtopped every other consideration that we both
  1663	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tburst out into a roar of laughter.
  1664	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1665	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I cannot see that there is anything very funny," cried our
  1666	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tclient, flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. "If you can

  1668	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1669	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No, no," cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from
  1670	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich he had half risen. "I really wouldn't miss your case for
  1671	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe world. It is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you
  1672	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twill excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it.
  1673	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tPray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the

  1700	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever
  1701	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\theard of either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross."
  1702	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1703	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And what did you do then?" asked Holmes.
  1704	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1705	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my
  1706	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tassistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say
  1707	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite
  1708	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgood enough, Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place
  1709	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twithout a struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough
  1710	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right
  1711	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\taway to you."
  1712	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1713	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And you did very wisely," said Holmes. "Your case is an
  1714	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\texceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it.
  1715	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tFrom what you have told me I think that it is possible that
  1716	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgraver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear."
  1717	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1718	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Grave enough!" said Mr. Jabez Wilson. "Why, I have lost four
  1719	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpound a week."
  1720	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1721	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"As far as you are personally concerned," remarked Holmes, "I do
  1722	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnot see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary
  1723	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tleague. On the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some
  1724	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t30 pounds, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have
  1725	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgained on every subject which comes under the letter A. You have
  1726	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlost nothing by them."
  1727	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1728	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are,
  1729	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand what their object was in playing this prank--if it was a
  1730	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tprank--upon me. It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it
  1731	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcost them two and thirty pounds."
  1732	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1733	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first,
  1734	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tone or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who
  1735	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfirst called your attention to the advertisement--how long had he
  1736	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbeen with you?"
  1737	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1738	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"About a month then."
  1739	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1740	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"How did he come?"
  1741	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1742	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"In answer to an advertisement."
  1743	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1744	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Was he the only applicant?"
  1745	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1746	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No, I had a dozen."
  1747	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1748	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Why did you pick him?"
  1749	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1750	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Because he was handy and would come cheap."
  1751	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1752	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"At half-wages, in fact."
  1753	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1754	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes."
  1755	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1756	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?"
  1757	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1758	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face,
  1759	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthough he's not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon
  1760	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this forehead."
  1761	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1762	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHolmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. "I thought
  1763	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tas much," said he. "Have you ever observed that his ears are
  1764	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpierced for earrings?"
  1765	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1766	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he
  1767	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas a lad."
  1768	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1769	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Hum!" said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. "He is still
  1770	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twith you?"
  1771	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1772	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him."
  1773	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1774	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And has your business been attended to in your absence?"
  1775	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1776	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Nothing to complain of, sir. There's never very much to do of a
  1777	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmorning."
  1778	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1779	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an
  1780	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\topinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is
  1781	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSaturday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion."
  1782	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1783	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, Watson," said Holmes when our visitor had left us, "what
  1784	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdo you make of it all?"
  1785	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1786	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I make nothing of it," I answered frankly. "It is a most
  1787	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmysterious business."
  1788	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1789	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"As a rule," said Holmes, "the more bizarre a thing is the less
  1790	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless
  1791	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcrimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is
  1792	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe most difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this
  1793	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmatter."
  1794	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1795	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What are you going to do, then?" I asked.
  1796	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1797	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"To smoke," he answered. "It is quite a three pipe problem, and I
  1798	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbeg that you won't speak to me for fifty minutes." He curled
  1799	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thimself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his
  1800	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thawk-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his
  1801	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tblack clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird.
  1802	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and
  1803	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tindeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his
  1804	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tchair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put
  1805	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this pipe down upon the mantelpiece.
  1806	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1807	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Sarasate plays at the St. James's Hall this afternoon," he
  1808	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tremarked. "What do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare
  1809	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyou for a few hours?"
  1810	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1811	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very
  1812	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tabsorbing."
  1813	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1814	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the City
  1815	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfirst, and we can have some lunch on the way. I observe that
  1816	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthere is a good deal of German music on the programme, which is
  1817	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trather more to my taste than Italian or French. It is
  1818	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tintrospective, and I want to introspect. Come along!"
  1819	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1820	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWe travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short
  1821	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twalk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular
  1822	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstory which we had listened to in the morning. It was a poky,
  1823	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlittle, shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy
  1824	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttwo-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in
  1825	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tenclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded
  1826	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlaurel-bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and
  1827	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tuncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown board with
  1828	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"JABEZ WILSON" in white letters, upon a corner house, announced
  1829	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe place where our red-headed client carried on his business.
  1830	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side
  1831	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between
  1832	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpuckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down
  1833	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tagain to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally
  1834	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\the returned to the pawnbroker's, and, having thumped vigorously
  1835	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tupon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up
  1836	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto the door and knocked. It was instantly opened by a
  1837	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step
  1838	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin.
  1839	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1840	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Thank you," said Holmes, "I only wished to ask you how you would
  1841	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgo from here to the Strand."
  1842	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1843	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Third right, fourth left," answered the assistant promptly,
  1844	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tclosing the door.
  1845	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1846	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Smart fellow, that," observed Holmes as we walked away. "He is,
  1847	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring
  1848	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known
  1849	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsomething of him before."
  1850	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1851	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Evidently," said I, "Mr. Wilson's assistant counts for a good
  1852	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdeal in this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you
  1853	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinquired your way merely in order that you might see him."
  1854	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1855	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Not him."
  1856	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1857	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What then?"
  1858	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1859	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The knees of his trousers."
  1860	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1861	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And what did you see?"
  1862	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1863	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What I expected to see."
  1864	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1865	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Why did you beat the pavement?"
  1866	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1867	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We
  1868	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tare spies in an enemy's country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg
  1869	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSquare. Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it."
  1870	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1871	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the
  1872	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcorner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a
  1873	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcontrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back. It was
  1874	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tone of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City
  1875	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto the north and west. The roadway was blocked with the immense
  1876	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward,
  1877	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhile the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of
  1878	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpedestrians. It was difficult to realise as we looked at the line
  1879	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof fine shops and stately business premises that they really
  1880	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tabutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square
  1881	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich we had just quitted.
  1882	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1883	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Let me see," said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing
  1884	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\talong the line, "I should like just to remember the order of the
  1885	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thouses here. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of
  1886	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tLondon. There is Mortimer's, the tobacconist, the little
  1887	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnewspaper shop, the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank,
  1888	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane's carriage-building
  1889	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdepot. That carries us right on to the other block. And now,
  1890	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tDoctor, we've done our work, so it's time we had some play. A
  1891	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where
  1892	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tall is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no
  1893	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tred-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums."
  1894	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1895	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tMy friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a
  1896	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvery capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All
  1897	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect
  1898	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thappiness, gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the
  1899	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmusic, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes
  1900	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twere as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the
  1901	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trelentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was
  1902	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpossible to conceive. In his singular character the dual nature
  1903	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\talternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and
  1904	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tastuteness represented, as I have often thought, the reaction
  1905	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tagainst the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally
  1906	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpredominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from
  1907	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\textreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was
  1908	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnever so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been
  1909	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his
  1910	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tblack-letter editions. Then it was that the lust of the chase
  1911	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twould suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning
  1912	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpower would rise to the level of intuition, until those who were
  1913	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tunacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a
  1914	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tman whose knowledge was not that of other mortals. When I saw him
  1915	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St. James's Hall I
  1916	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfelt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set
  1917	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thimself to hunt down.
  1918	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1919	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor," he remarked as we

  1921	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1922	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, it would be as well."
  1923	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1924	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And I have some business to do which will take some hours. This
  1925	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbusiness at Coburg Square is serious."
  1926	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1927	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Why serious?"
  1928	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1929	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to
  1930	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbelieve that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being
  1931	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSaturday rather complicates matters. I shall want your help
  1932	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto-night."
  1933	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1934	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"At what time?"
  1935	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1936	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Ten will be early enough."
  1937	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t

  1939	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t

  1942	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the

  1944	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1945	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was
  1946	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\talways oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings
  1947	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twith Sherlock Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had
  1948	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tseen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that
  1949	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\the saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to
  1950	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thappen, while to me the whole business was still confused and
  1951	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgrotesque. As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought
  1952	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tover it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed
  1953	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcopier of the "Encyclopaedia" down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg
  1954	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSquare, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me.
  1955	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWhat was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed?
  1956	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWhere were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from
  1957	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHolmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a
  1958	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tformidable man--a man who might play a deep game. I tried to
  1959	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpuzzle it out, but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside
  1960	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tuntil night should bring an explanation.
  1961	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1962	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tIt was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my
  1963	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tway across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker
  1964	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tStreet. Two hansoms were standing at the door, and as I entered
  1965	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe passage I heard the sound of voices from above. On entering
  1966	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this room I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men,
  1967	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tone of whom I recognised as Peter Jones, the official police
  1968	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tagent, while the other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a
  1969	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvery shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat.
  1970	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1971	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Ha! Our party is complete," said Holmes, buttoning up his
  1972	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack.
  1973	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Watson, I think you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me
  1974	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tintroduce you to Mr. Merryweather, who is to be our companion in
  1975	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto-night's adventure."
  1976	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1977	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"We're hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see," said Jones in
  1978	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this consequential way. "Our friend here is a wonderful man for
  1979	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstarting a chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do
  1980	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe running down."
  1981	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1982	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,"
  1983	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tobserved Mr. Merryweather gloomily.
  1984	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1985	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir," said
  1986	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe police agent loftily. "He has his own little methods, which
  1987	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tare, if he won't mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical
  1988	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him. It
  1989	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tis not too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of
  1990	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly
  1991	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcorrect than the official force."
  1992	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1993	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right," said the
  1994	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstranger with deference. "Still, I confess that I miss my rubber.
  1995	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tIt is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I
  1996	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave not had my rubber."
  1997	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  1998	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I think you will find," said Sherlock Holmes, "that you will
  1999	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tplay for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and
  2000	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat the play will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather,
  2001	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe stake will be some 30,000 pounds; and for you, Jones, it will
  2002	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbe the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands."
  2003	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2004	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He's a
  2005	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyoung man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his
  2006	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tprofession, and I would rather have my bracelets on him than on
  2007	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tany criminal in London. He's a remarkable man, is young John
  2008	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tClay. His grandfather was a royal duke, and he himself has been
  2009	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as his fingers, and

  2011	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfind the man himself. He'll crack a crib in Scotland one week,
  2012	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next.

  2022	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2023	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive
  2024	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in
  2025	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit
  2026	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstreets until we emerged into Farrington Street.
  2027	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2028	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"We are close there now," my friend remarked. "This fellow
  2029	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tMerryweather is a bank director, and personally interested in the
  2030	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmatter. I thought it as well to have Jones with us also. He is
  2031	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnot a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession.
  2032	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHe has one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog and as
  2033	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone. Here we
  2034	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tare, and they are waiting for us."
  2035	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2036	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWe had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had
  2037	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfound ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and,
  2038	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfollowing the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a
  2039	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnarrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us.
  2040	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWithin there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive
  2041	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tiron gate. This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding
  2042	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate. Mr.
  2043	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tMerryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us
  2044	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdown a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a
  2045	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthird door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all
  2046	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tround with crates and massive boxes.
  2047	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2048	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You are not very vulnerable from above," Holmes remarked as he
  2049	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\theld up the lantern and gazed about him.
  2050	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2051	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Nor from below," said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon
  2052	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe flags which lined the floor. "Why, dear me, it sounds quite
  2053	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thollow!" he remarked, looking up in surprise.
  2054	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2055	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!" said Holmes
  2056	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tseverely. "You have already imperilled the whole success of our
  2057	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\texpedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit
  2058	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdown upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?"
  2059	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2060	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a
  2061	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvery injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his
  2062	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tknees upon the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens,
  2063	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbegan to examine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few
  2064	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tseconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again
  2065	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand put his glass in his pocket.
  2066	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2067	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"We have at least an hour before us," he remarked, "for they can
  2068	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed.
  2069	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThen they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their
  2070	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twork the longer time they will have for their escape. We are at
  2071	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpresent, Doctor--as no doubt you have divined--in the cellar of
  2072	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe City branch of one of the principal London banks. Mr.
  2073	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tMerryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to
  2074	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyou that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of
  2075	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tLondon should take a considerable interest in this cellar at
  2076	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpresent."
  2077	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2078	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It is our French gold," whispered the director. "We have had
  2079	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tseveral warnings that an attempt might be made upon it."
  2080	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2081	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Your French gold?"
  2082	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2083	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources
  2084	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of
  2085	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tFrance. It has become known that we have never had occasion to
  2086	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tunpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar. The
  2087	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcrate upon which I sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between
  2088	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlayers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is much larger at
  2089	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpresent than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the
  2090	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdirectors have had misgivings upon the subject."
  2091	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2092	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Which were very well justified," observed Holmes. "And now it is
  2093	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttime that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an
  2094	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thour matters will come to a head. In the meantime Mr.
  2095	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tMerryweather, we must put the screen over that dark lantern."
  2096	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2097	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And sit in the dark?"
  2098	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2099	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and
  2100	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI thought that, as we were a partie carrÃ©e, you might have your
  2101	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trubber after all. But I see that the enemy's preparations have
  2102	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And,
  2103	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfirst of all, we must choose our positions. These are daring men,
  2104	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may do us
  2105	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsome harm unless we are careful. I shall stand behind this crate,
  2106	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand do you conceal yourselves behind those. Then, when I flash a
  2107	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlight upon them, close in swiftly. If they fire, Watson, have no
  2108	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcompunction about shooting them down."
  2109	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2110	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case
  2111	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbehind which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front
  2112	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof his lantern and left us in pitch darkness--such an absolute
  2113	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdarkness as I have never before experienced. The smell of hot
  2114	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmetal remained to assure us that the light was still there, ready
  2115	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto flash out at a moment's notice. To me, with my nerves worked
  2116	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tup to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and
  2117	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsubduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold dank air of the
  2118	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvault.
  2119	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2120	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"They have but one retreat," whispered Holmes. "That is back
  2121	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthrough the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have
  2122	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdone what I asked you, Jones?"
  2123	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2124	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door."
  2125	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2126	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent
  2127	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand wait."
  2128	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2129	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWhat a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but
  2130	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tan hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must
  2131	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave almost gone and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs
  2132	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twere weary and stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my
  2133	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my
  2134	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thearing was so acute that I could not only hear the gentle
  2135	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbreathing of my companions, but I could distinguish the deeper,
  2136	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\theavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note
  2137	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof the bank director. From my position I could look over the case
  2138	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught the glint
  2139	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof a light.
  2140	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2141	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tAt first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then
  2142	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then,
  2143	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twithout any warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand
  2144	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tappeared, a white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the
  2145	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcentre of the little area of light. For a minute or more the
  2146	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then
  2147	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark
  2148	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tagain save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between
  2149	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe stones.
  2150	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2151	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tIts disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending,
  2152	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttearing sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon
  2153	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tits side and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed
  2154	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe light of a lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut,
  2155	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tboyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand
  2156	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ton either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and
  2157	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twaist-high, until one knee rested upon the edge. In another
  2158	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinstant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after
  2159	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thim a companion, lithe and small like himself, with a pale face
  2160	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand a shock of very red hair.
  2161	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2162	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It's all clear," he whispered. "Have you the chisel and the
  2163	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbags? Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I'll swing for it!"
  2164	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2165	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the
  2166	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcollar. The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of
  2167	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed
  2168	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tupon the barrel of a revolver, but Holmes' hunting crop came
  2169	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdown on the man's wrist, and the pistol clinked upon the stone
  2170	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfloor.
  2171	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2172	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It's no use, John Clay," said Holmes blandly. "You have no
  2173	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tchance at all."
  2174	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2175	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"So I see," the other answered with the utmost coolness. "I fancy
  2176	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat my pal is all right, though I see you have got his
  2177	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcoat-tails."
  2178	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2179	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"There are three men waiting for him at the door," said Holmes.
  2180	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2181	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I

  2183	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2184	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And I you," Holmes answered. "Your red-headed idea was very new
  2185	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand effective."
  2186	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2187	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You'll see your pal again presently," said Jones. "He's quicker
  2188	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tat climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the
  2189	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tderbies."
  2190	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2191	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,"
  2192	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tremarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists.
  2193	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You may not be aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have
  2194	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe goodness, also, when you address me always to say 'sir' and
  2195	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t'please.'"
  2196	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2197	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"All right," said Jones with a stare and a snigger. "Well, would
  2198	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyou please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry
  2199	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyour Highness to the police-station?"
  2200	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2201	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"That is better," said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow
  2202	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the
  2203	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdetective.
  2204	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2205	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Really, Mr. Holmes," said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them
  2206	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfrom the cellar, "I do not know how the bank can thank you or
  2207	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trepay you. There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated
  2208	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts
  2209	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tat bank robbery that have ever come within my experience."
  2210	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2211	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr.
  2212	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tJohn Clay," said Holmes. "I have been at some small expense over
  2213	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthis matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond
  2214	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in
  2215	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmany ways unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of
  2216	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe Red-headed League."
  2217	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2218	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2219	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You see, Watson," he explained in the early hours of the morning
  2220	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tas we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, "it
  2221	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible
  2222	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tobject of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of
  2223	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe League, and the copying of the 'Encyclopaedia,' must be to get
  2224	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthis not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of
  2225	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thours every day. It was a curious way of managing it, but,
  2226	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\treally, it would be difficult to suggest a better. The method was
  2227	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tno doubt suggested to Clay's ingenious mind by the colour of his
  2228	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\taccomplice's hair. The 4 pounds a week was a lure which must draw
  2229	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thim, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands?
  2230	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThey put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary
  2231	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\toffice, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and
  2232	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttogether they manage to secure his absence every morning in the
  2233	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tweek. From the time that I heard of the assistant having come for
  2234	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thalf wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive
  2235	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfor securing the situation."
  2236	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2237	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But how could you guess what the motive was?"
  2238	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2239	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a
  2240	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmere vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The
  2241	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tman's business was a small one, and there was nothing in his
  2242	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thouse which could account for such elaborate preparations, and
  2243	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsuch an expenditure as they were at. It must, then, be something
  2244	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tout of the house. What could it be? I thought of the assistant's
  2245	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the
  2246	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcellar. The cellar! There was the end of this tangled clue. Then
  2247	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that I
  2248	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thad to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in
  2249	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tLondon. He was doing something in the cellar--something which
  2250	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttook many hours a day for months on end. What could it be, once
  2251	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmore? I could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel
  2252	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto some other building.
  2253	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2254	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I
  2255	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsurprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was
  2256	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind.
  2257	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tIt was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the
  2258	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tassistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had
  2259	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnever set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his
  2260	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tface. His knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have
  2261	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tremarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of
  2262	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthose hours of burrowing. The only remaining point was what they
  2263	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twere burrowing for. I walked round the corner, saw the City and
  2264	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSuburban Bank abutted on our friend's premises, and felt that I
  2265	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thad solved my problem. When you drove home after the concert I
  2266	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcalled upon Scotland Yard and upon the chairman of the bank
  2267	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdirectors, with the result that you have seen."
  2268	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2269	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And how could you tell that they would make their attempt
  2270	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto-night?" I asked.
  2271	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2272	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that
  2273	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthey cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson's presence--in other
  2274	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twords, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential
  2275	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the
  2276	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbullion might be removed. Saturday would suit them better than
  2277	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tany other day, as it would give them two days for their escape.
  2278	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tFor all these reasons I expected them to come to-night."
  2279	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2280	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You reasoned it out beautifully," I exclaimed in unfeigned
  2281	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tadmiration. "It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings
  2282	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttrue."
  2283	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2284	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It saved me from ennui," he answered, yawning. "Alas! I already

  2286	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto escape from the commonplaces of existence. These little
  2287	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tproblems help me to do so."
  2288	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2289	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And you are a benefactor of the race," said I.
  2290	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2291	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHe shrugged his shoulders. "Well, perhaps, after all, it is of
  2292	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsome little use," he remarked. "'L'homme c'est rien--l'oeuvre

  2298	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2299	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"My dear fellow," said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side
  2300	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street, "life is infinitely
  2301	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. We
  2302	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twould not dare to conceive the things which are really mere
  2303	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcommonplaces of existence. If we could fly out of that window
  2304	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the
  2305	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\troofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the
  2306	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstrange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the
  2307	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twonderful chains of events, working through generations, and
  2308	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tleading to the most outrÃ© results, it would make all fiction with
  2309	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tits conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and
  2310	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tunprofitable."
  2311	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2312	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And yet I am not convinced of it," I answered. "The cases which
  2313	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcome to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and
  2314	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvulgar enough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to
  2315	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tits extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed,
  2316	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tneither fascinating nor artistic."
  2317	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2318	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a
  2319	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trealistic effect," remarked Holmes. "This is wanting in the
  2320	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpolice report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the
  2321	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tplatitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an
  2322	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tobserver contain the vital essence of the whole matter. Depend
  2323	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tupon it, there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace."
  2324	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2325	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI smiled and shook my head. "I can quite understand your thinking
  2326	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tso," I said. "Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser
  2327	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout
  2328	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthree continents, you are brought in contact with all that is
  2329	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstrange and bizarre. But here"--I picked up the morning paper
  2330	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfrom the ground--"let us put it to a practical test. Here is the
  2331	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfirst heading upon which I come. 'A husband's cruelty to his
  2332	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twife.' There is half a column of print, but I know without
  2333	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\treading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. There is, of
  2334	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcourse, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the
  2335	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of
  2336	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twriters could invent nothing more crude."
  2337	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2338	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,"
  2339	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsaid Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. "This
  2340	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tis the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged
  2341	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin clearing up some small points in connection with it. The
  2342	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thusband was a teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the
  2343	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tconduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of
  2344	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twinding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling
  2345	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthem at his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely
  2346	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto occur to the imagination of the average story-teller. Take a

  2349	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2350	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHe held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in

  2352	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thomely ways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon

  2354	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2355	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Ah," said he, "I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks.

  2358	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2359	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And the ring?" I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which

  2361	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2362	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in

  2364	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\teven to you, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of

  2366	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2367	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And have you any on hand just now?" I asked with interest.
  2368	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2369	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of
  2370	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinterest. They are important, you understand, without being
  2371	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinteresting. Indeed, I have found that it is usually in
  2372	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tunimportant matters that there is a field for the observation,
  2373	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the
  2374	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcharm to an investigation. The larger crimes are apt to be the
  2375	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsimpler, for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a rule, is
  2376	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe motive. In these cases, save for one rather intricate matter
  2377	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing
  2378	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich presents any features of interest. It is possible, however,
  2379	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat I may have something better before very many minutes are
  2380	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tover, for this is one of my clients, or I am much mistaken."
  2381	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2382	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHe had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted
  2383	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tblinds gazing down into the dull neutral-tinted London street.
  2384	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tLooking over his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite
  2385	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthere stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck,
  2386	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was
  2387	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttilted in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her
  2388	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tear. From under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous,
  2389	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thesitating fashion at our windows, while her body oscillated
  2390	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbackward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her glove
  2391	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbuttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves
  2392	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp
  2393	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tclang of the bell.
  2394	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2395	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I have seen those symptoms before," said Holmes, throwing his
  2396	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcigarette into the fire. "Oscillation upon the pavement always
  2397	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmeans an affaire de coeur. She would like advice, but is not sure
  2398	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat the matter is not too delicate for communication. And yet
  2399	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\teven here we may discriminate. When a woman has been seriously
  2400	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twronged by a man she no longer oscillates, and the usual symptom
  2401	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tis a broken bell wire. Here we may take it that there is a love
  2402	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmatter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or
  2403	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgrieved. But here she comes in person to resolve our doubts."
  2404	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2405	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tAs he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons
  2406	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tentered to announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself
  2407	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tloomed behind his small black figure like a full-sailed

  2411	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ther over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was
  2412	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpeculiar to him.
  2413	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2414	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Do you not find," he said, "that with your short sight it is a
  2415	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlittle trying to do so much typewriting?"
  2416	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2417	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I did at first," she answered, "but now I know where the letters
  2418	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tare without looking." Then, suddenly realising the full purport
  2419	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof his words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear
  2420	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand astonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. "You've
  2421	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\theard about me, Mr. Holmes," she cried, "else how could you know
  2422	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tall that?"
  2423	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2424	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Never mind," said Holmes, laughing; "it is my business to know
  2425	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthings. Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others
  2426	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\toverlook. If not, why should you come to consult me?"
  2427	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2428	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege,
  2429	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had
  2430	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgiven him up for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as
  2431	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmuch for me. I'm not rich, but still I have a hundred a year in
  2432	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmy own right, besides the little that I make by the machine, and
  2433	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI would give it all to know what has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel."
  2434	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2435	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?" asked
  2436	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSherlock Holmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to
  2437	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe ceiling.
  2438	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2439	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tAgain a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss
  2440	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tMary Sutherland. "Yes, I did bang out of the house," she said,
  2441	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"for it made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr.
  2442	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWindibank--that is, my father--took it all. He would not go to
  2443	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe police, and he would not go to you, and so at last, as he
  2444	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twould do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done,
  2445	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit made me mad, and I just on with my things and came right away
  2446	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto you."
  2447	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2448	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Your father," said Holmes, "your stepfather, surely, since the
  2449	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tname is different."
  2450	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2451	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny,
  2452	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttoo, for he is only five years and two months older than myself."
  2453	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2454	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And your mother is alive?"
  2455	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2456	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn't best pleased, Mr.
  2457	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHolmes, when she married again so soon after father's death, and
  2458	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father
  2459	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy
  2460	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbusiness behind him, which mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the
  2461	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tforeman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made her sell the
  2462	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbusiness, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines.
  2463	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThey got 4700 pounds for the goodwill and interest, which wasn't
  2464	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnear as much as father could have got if he had been alive."
  2465	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2466	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this
  2467	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trambling and inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he
  2468	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thad listened with the greatest concentration of attention.
  2469	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2470	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Your own little income," he asked, "does it come out of the
  2471	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbusiness?"
  2472	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2473	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle
  2474	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tNed in Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4 1/2 per
  2475	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcent. Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can
  2476	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tonly touch the interest."
  2477	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2478	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You interest me extremely," said Holmes. "And since you draw so
  2479	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlarge a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the
  2480	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbargain, you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in
  2481	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tevery way. I believe that a single lady can get on very nicely
  2482	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tupon an income of about 60 pounds."
  2483	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2484	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you
  2485	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tunderstand that as long as I live at home I don't wish to be a
  2486	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tburden to them, and so they have the use of the money just while
  2487	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI am staying with them. Of course, that is only just for the
  2488	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttime. Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it
  2489	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tover to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I
  2490	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tearn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can
  2491	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\toften do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day."
  2492	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2493	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You have made your position very clear to me," said Holmes.
  2494	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"This is my friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as
  2495	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfreely as before myself. Kindly tell us now all about your
  2496	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tconnection with Mr. Hosmer Angel."
  2497	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2498	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tA flush stole over Miss Sutherland's face, and she picked
  2499	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnervously at the fringe of her jacket. "I met him first at the
  2500	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgasfitters' ball," she said. "They used to send father tickets
  2501	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhen he was alive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and
  2502	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsent them to mother. Mr. Windibank did not wish us to go. He
  2503	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnever did wish us to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I
  2504	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But this time I
  2505	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to
  2506	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tprevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all
  2507	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfather's friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing
  2508	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfit to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much
  2509	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tas taken out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do,
  2510	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\the went off to France upon the business of the firm, but we went,
  2511	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it
  2512	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas there I met Mr. Hosmer Angel."
  2513	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2514	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I suppose," said Holmes, "that when Mr. Windibank came back from
  2515	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tFrance he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball."
  2516	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2517	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and
  2518	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying
  2519	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tanything to a woman, for she would have her way."
  2520	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2521	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I see. Then at the gasfitters' ball you met, as I understand, a
  2522	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel."
  2523	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2524	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if
  2525	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twe had got home all safe, and after that we met him--that is to
  2526	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsay, Mr. Holmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father
  2527	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcame back again, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house
  2528	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tany more."
  2529	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2530	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No?"
  2531	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2532	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, you know father didn't like anything of the sort. He
  2533	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twouldn't have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to
  2534	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsay that a woman should be happy in her own family circle. But
  2535	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthen, as I used to say to mother, a woman wants her own circle to
  2536	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbegin with, and I had not got mine yet."
  2537	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2538	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see
  2539	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyou?"
  2540	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2541	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer
  2542	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each
  2543	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tother until he had gone. We could write in the meantime, and he
  2544	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tused to write every day. I took the letters in in the morning, so
  2545	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthere was no need for father to know."
  2546	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2547	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?"
  2548	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2549	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that
  2550	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twe took. Hosmer--Mr. Angel--was a cashier in an office in
  2551	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tLeadenhall Street--and--"
  2552	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2553	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What office?"
  2554	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2555	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"That's the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don't know."
  2556	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2557	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Where did he live, then?"
  2558	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2559	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"He slept on the premises."
  2560	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2561	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And you don't know his address?"
  2562	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2563	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No--except that it was Leadenhall Street."
  2564	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2565	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Where did you address your letters, then?"
  2566	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2567	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called
  2568	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfor. He said that if they were sent to the office he would be
  2569	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tchaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady,
  2570	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tso I offered to typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn't
  2571	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave that, for he said that when I wrote them they seemed to come
  2572	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfrom me, but when they were typewritten he always felt that the
  2573	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmachine had come between us. That will just show you how fond he
  2574	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas of me, Mr. Holmes, and the little things that he would think
  2575	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof."
  2576	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2577	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It was most suggestive," said Holmes. "It has long been an axiom
  2578	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof mine that the little things are infinitely the most important.
  2579	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tCan you remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?"
  2580	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2581	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me
  2582	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin the evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to
  2583	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbe conspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his
  2584	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvoice was gentle. He'd had the quinsy and swollen glands when he
  2585	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas young, he told me, and it had left him with a weak throat,
  2586	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech. He was always
  2587	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twell dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak, just
  2588	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tas mine are, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare."
  2589	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2590	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather,
  2591	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\treturned to France?"
  2592	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2593	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we
  2594	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshould marry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest
  2595	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand made me swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever
  2596	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thappened I would always be true to him. Mother said he was quite
  2597	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tright to make me swear, and that it was a sign of his passion.
  2598	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tMother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder
  2599	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof him than I was. Then, when they talked of marrying within the
  2600	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tweek, I began to ask about father; but they both said never to
  2601	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmind about father, but just to tell him afterwards, and mother
  2602	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsaid she would make it all right with him. I didn't quite like
  2603	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask his leave, as
  2604	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\the was only a few years older than me; but I didn't want to do
  2605	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tanything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the
  2606	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcompany has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on
  2607	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe very morning of the wedding."
  2608	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2609	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It missed him, then?"
  2610	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2611	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived."
  2612	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2613	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for
  2614	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe Friday. Was it to be in church?"
  2615	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2616	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour's, near
  2617	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tKing's Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St.
  2618	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tPancras Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were
  2619	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttwo of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a
  2620	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfour-wheeler, which happened to be the only other cab in the
  2621	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstreet. We got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler
  2622	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdrove up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, and
  2623	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhen the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one
  2624	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthere! The cabman said that he could not imagine what had become
  2625	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof him, for he had seen him get in with his own eyes. That was
  2626	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlast Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard anything
  2627	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsince then to throw any light upon what became of him."
  2628	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2629	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated," said

  2631	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2632	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all
  2633	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to
  2634	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbe true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to
  2635	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tseparate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him,
  2636	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand that he would claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed
  2637	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstrange talk for a wedding-morning, but what has happened since

  2639	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2640	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some
  2641	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tunforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?"

  2643	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he
  2644	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twould not have talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw
  2645	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thappened."
  2646	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2647	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But you have no notion as to what it could have been?"
  2648	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2649	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"None."
  2650	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2651	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"One more question. How did your mother take the matter?"
  2652	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2653	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter
  2654	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tagain."
  2655	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2656	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And your father? Did you tell him?"
  2657	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2658	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had
  2659	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thappened, and that I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said,
  2660	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhat interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of
  2661	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe church, and then leaving me? Now, if he had borrowed my
  2662	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmoney, or if he had married me and got my money settled on him,
  2663	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthere might be some reason, but Hosmer was very independent about
  2664	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmoney and never would look at a shilling of mine. And yet, what
  2665	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcould have happened? And why could he not write? Oh, it drives me
  2666	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thalf-mad to think of it, and I can't sleep a wink at night." She
  2667	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob
  2668	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\theavily into it.
  2669	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2670	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I shall glance into the case for you," said Holmes, rising, "and
  2671	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. Let the
  2672	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tweight of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind
  2673	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdwell upon it further. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel
  2674	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvanish from your memory, as he has done from your life."
  2675	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2676	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Then you don't think I'll see him again?"
  2677	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2678	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I fear not."
  2679	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2680	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Then what has happened to him?"
  2681	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2682	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You will leave that question in my hands. I should like an
  2683	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\taccurate description of him and any letters of his which you can
  2684	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tspare."
  2685	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2686	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I advertised for him in last Saturday's Chronicle," said she.
  2687	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Here is the slip and here are four letters from him."
  2688	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2689	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Thank you. And your address?"
  2690	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2691	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell."
  2692	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2693	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Mr. Angel's address you never had, I understand. Where is your
  2694	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfather's place of business?"
  2695	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2696	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"He travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers
  2697	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof Fenchurch Street."
  2698	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2699	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Thank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will
  2700	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tleave the papers here, and remember the advice which I have given
  2701	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyou. Let the whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it

  2703	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2704	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be

  2706	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2707	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tFor all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was
  2708	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsomething noble in the simple faith of our visitor which
  2709	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcompelled our respect. She laid her little bundle of papers upon
  2710	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe table and went her way, with a promise to come again whenever
  2711	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshe might be summoned.
  2712	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2713	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips
  2714	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstill pressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him,
  2715	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand his gaze directed upward to the ceiling. Then he took down
  2716	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfrom the rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a
  2717	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcounsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with
  2718	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of
  2719	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinfinite languor in his face.
  2720	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2721	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Quite an interesting study, that maiden," he observed. "I found
  2722	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ther more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way,
  2723	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tis rather a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you
  2724	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tconsult my index, in Andover in '77, and there was something of
  2725	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe sort at The Hague last year. Old as is the idea, however,
  2726	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthere were one or two details which were new to me. But the
  2727	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmaiden herself was most instructive."
  2728	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2729	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite
  2730	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinvisible to me," I remarked.
  2731	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2732	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to
  2733	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlook, and so you missed all that was important. I can never bring
  2734	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyou to realise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of
  2735	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthumb-nails, or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace.
  2736	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tNow, what did you gather from that woman's appearance? Describe
  2737	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit."
  2738	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2739	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a
  2740	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfeather of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads
  2741	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsewn upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her
  2742	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdress was brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little
  2743	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpurple plush at the neck and sleeves. Her gloves were greyish and
  2744	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twere worn through at the right forefinger. Her boots I didn't
  2745	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tobserve. She had small round, hanging gold earrings, and a
  2746	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgeneral air of being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable,
  2747	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\teasy-going way."
  2748	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2749	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.
  2750	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2751	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have
  2752	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\treally done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed
  2753	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\teverything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and
  2754	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyou have a quick eye for colour. Never trust to general
  2755	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\timpressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My
  2756	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfirst glance is always at a woman's sleeve. In a man it is
  2757	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tperhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser. As you
  2758	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tobserve, this woman had plush upon her sleeves, which is a most
  2759	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tuseful material for showing traces. The double line a little
  2760	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tabove the wrist, where the typewritist presses against the table,
  2761	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand type,
  2762	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tleaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side
  2763	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the
  2764	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbroadest part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and,
  2765	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tobserving the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I
  2766	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting, which seemed
  2767	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto surprise her."
  2768	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2769	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It surprised me."
  2770	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2771	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and
  2772	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinterested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots
  2773	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich she was wearing were not unlike each other, they were
  2774	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\treally odd ones; the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and
  2775	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe other a plain one. One was buttoned only in the two lower
  2776	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbuttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and
  2777	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfifth. Now, when you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly
  2778	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdressed, has come away from home with odd boots, half-buttoned,
  2779	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry."
  2780	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2781	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And what else?" I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by
  2782	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmy friend's incisive reasoning.
  2783	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2784	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving
  2785	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thome but after being fully dressed. You observed that her right
  2786	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tglove was torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see
  2787	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat both glove and finger were stained with violet ink. She had
  2788	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twritten in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep. It must have been
  2789	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthis morning, or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger.
  2790	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tAll this is amusing, though rather elementary, but I must go back
  2791	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto business, Watson. Would you mind reading me the advertised
  2792	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdescription of Mr. Hosmer Angel?"
  2793	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2794	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI held the little printed slip to the light.
  2795	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2796	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Missing," it said, "on the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman
  2797	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnamed Hosmer Angel. About five ft. seven in. in height;
  2798	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstrongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a little bald in

  2805	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2806	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"That will do," said Holmes. "As to the letters," he continued,
  2807	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tglancing over them, "they are very commonplace. Absolutely no
  2808	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tclue in them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There
  2809	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tis one remarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike
  2810	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyou."
  2811	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2812	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"They are typewritten," I remarked.
  2813	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2814	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Not only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the
  2815	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tneat little 'Hosmer Angel' at the bottom. There is a date, you
  2816	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsee, but no superscription except Leadenhall Street, which is
  2817	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trather vague. The point about the signature is very suggestive--in
  2818	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfact, we may call it conclusive."
  2819	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2820	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Of what?"
  2821	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2822	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it
  2823	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbears upon the case?"
  2824	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2825	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able
  2826	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were
  2827	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinstituted."
  2828	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2829	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters,
  2830	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich should settle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the
  2831	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tother is to the young lady's stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking
  2832	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thim whether he could meet us here at six o'clock tomorrow
  2833	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tevening. It is just as well that we should do business with the
  2834	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmale relatives. And now, Doctor, we can do nothing until the
  2835	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tanswers to those letters come, so we may put our little problem
  2836	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tupon the shelf for the interim."
  2837	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2838	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI had had so many reasons to believe in my friend's subtle powers
  2839	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt that
  2840	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\the must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy
  2841	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdemeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had
  2842	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbeen called upon to fathom. Once only had I known him to fail, in
  2843	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe case of the King of Bohemia and of the Irene Adler
  2844	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tphotograph; but when I looked back to the weird business of the
  2845	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSign of Four, and the extraordinary circumstances connected with
  2846	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe Study in Scarlet, I felt that it would be a strange tangle
  2847	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tindeed which he could not unravel.
  2848	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2849	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the
  2850	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tconviction that when I came again on the next evening I would
  2851	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfind that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up
  2852	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary
  2853	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSutherland.
  2854	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2855	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tA professional case of great gravity was engaging my own
  2856	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tattention at the time, and the whole of next day I was busy at
  2857	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe bedside of the sufferer. It was not until close upon six
  2858	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\to'clock that I found myself free and was able to spring into a
  2859	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thansom and drive to Baker Street, half afraid that I might be too
  2860	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlate to assist at the dÃ©nouement of the little mystery. I found
  2861	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSherlock Holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin
  2862	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tform curled up in the recesses of his armchair. A formidable
  2863	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tarray of bottles and test-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell
  2864	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent his day in the
  2865	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tchemical work which was so dear to him.
  2866	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2867	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, have you solved it?" I asked as I entered.
  2868	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2869	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes. It was the bisulphate of baryta."
  2870	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2871	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No, no, the mystery!" I cried.
  2872	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2873	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon.
  2874	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThere was never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said
  2875	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyesterday, some of the details are of interest. The only drawback

  2880	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2881	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet

  2883	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpassage and a tap at the door.
  2884	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2885	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"This is the girl's stepfather, Mr. James Windibank," said
  2886	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHolmes. "He has written to me to say that he would be here at
  2887	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsix. Come in!"
  2888	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2889	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some
  2890	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthirty years of age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a
  2891	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbland, insinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and
  2892	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpenetrating grey eyes. He shot a questioning glance at each of
  2893	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tus, placed his shiny top-hat upon the sideboard, and with a
  2894	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tslight bow sidled down into the nearest chair.
  2895	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2896	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Good-evening, Mr. James Windibank," said Holmes. "I think that
  2897	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthis typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an
  2898	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tappointment with me for six o'clock?"
  2899	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2900	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not
  2901	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tquite my own master, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland
  2902	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thas troubled you about this little matter, for I think it is far
  2903	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbetter not to wash linen of the sort in public. It was quite
  2904	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tagainst my wishes that she came, but she is a very excitable,
  2905	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\timpulsive girl, as you may have noticed, and she is not easily
  2906	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcontrolled when she has made up her mind on a point. Of course, I
  2907	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdid not mind you so much, as you are not connected with the
  2908	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tofficial police, but it is not pleasant to have a family
  2909	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmisfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a useless
  2910	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\texpense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?"
  2911	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2912	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"On the contrary," said Holmes quietly; "I have every reason to
  2913	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbelieve that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel."
  2914	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2915	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tMr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. "I am
  2916	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdelighted to hear it," he said.
  2917	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2918	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It is a curious thing," remarked Holmes, "that a typewriter has
  2919	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\treally quite as much individuality as a man's handwriting. Unless
  2920	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthey are quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some
  2921	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tletters get more worn than others, and some wear only on one
  2922	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tside. Now, you remark in this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that
  2923	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin every case there is some little slurring over of the 'e,' and
  2924	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta slight defect in the tail of the 'r.' There are fourteen other
  2925	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcharacteristics, but those are the more obvious."
  2926	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2927	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office,
  2928	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand no doubt it is a little worn," our visitor answered, glancing
  2929	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tkeenly at Holmes with his bright little eyes.
  2930	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2931	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study,
  2932	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tMr. Windibank," Holmes continued. "I think of writing another
  2933	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlittle monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its
  2934	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trelation to crime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some
  2935	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlittle attention. I have here four letters which purport to come
  2936	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfrom the missing man. They are all typewritten. In each case, not
  2937	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tonly are the 'e's' slurred and the 'r's' tailless, but you will
  2938	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tobserve, if you care to use my magnifying lens, that the fourteen
  2939	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tother characteristics to which I have alluded are there as well."
  2940	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2941	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tMr. Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. "I
  2942	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes,"
  2943	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\the said. "If you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know
  2944	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhen you have done it."
  2945	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2946	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Certainly," said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in
  2947	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe door. "I let you know, then, that I have caught him!"
  2948	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2949	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What! where?" shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips
  2950	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand glancing about him like a rat in a trap.
  2951	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2952	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Oh, it won't do--really it won't," said Holmes suavely. "There
  2953	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tis no possible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too
  2954	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttransparent, and it was a very bad compliment when you said that
  2955	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit was impossible for me to solve so simple a question. That's
  2956	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tright! Sit down and let us talk it over."
  2957	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2958	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tOur visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a
  2959	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tglitter of moisture on his brow. "It--it's not actionable," he
  2960	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstammered.
  2961	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2962	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves,
  2963	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWindibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a
  2964	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpetty way as ever came before me. Now, let me just run over the
  2965	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcourse of events, and you will contradict me if I go wrong."
  2966	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2967	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his
  2968	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbreast, like one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up
  2969	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ton the corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands
  2970	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed,
  2971	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthan to us.
  2972	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2973	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The man married a woman very much older than himself for her
  2974	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmoney," said he, "and he enjoyed the use of the money of the
  2975	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdaughter as long as she lived with them. It was a considerable
  2976	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsum, for people in their position, and the loss of it would have
  2977	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmade a serious difference. It was worth an effort to preserve it.
  2978	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe daughter was of a good, amiable disposition, but affectionate
  2979	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was evident that with
  2980	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ther fair personal advantages, and her little income, she would
  2981	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnot be allowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would
  2982	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her
  2983	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstepfather do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of
  2984	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tkeeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of
  2985	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpeople of her own age. But soon he found that that would not
  2986	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tanswer forever. She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and
  2987	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfinally announced her positive intention of going to a certain
  2988	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tball. What does her clever stepfather do then? He conceives an
  2989	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tidea more creditable to his head than to his heart. With the
  2990	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tconnivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself,
  2991	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcovered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with
  2992	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice
  2993	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinto an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the
  2994	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgirl's short sight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off
  2995	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tother lovers by making love himself."
  2996	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  2997	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It was only a joke at first," groaned our visitor. "We never
  2998	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthought that she would have been so carried away."
  2999	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3000	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Very likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very
  3001	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdecidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that
  3002	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ther stepfather was in France, the suspicion of treachery never
  3003	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfor an instant entered her mind. She was flattered by the
  3004	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgentleman's attentions, and the effect was increased by the
  3005	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tloudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began
  3006	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as
  3007	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfar as it would go if a real effect were to be produced. There
  3008	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twere meetings, and an engagement, which would finally secure the
  3009	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgirl's affections from turning towards anyone else. But the
  3010	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdeception could not be kept up forever. These pretended journeys
  3011	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto France were rather cumbrous. The thing to do was clearly to
  3012	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it
  3013	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twould leave a permanent impression upon the young lady's mind and
  3014	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tprevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to
  3015	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcome. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a Testament, and
  3016	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening
  3017	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ton the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished Miss
  3018	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to
  3019	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not
  3020	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlisten to another man. As far as the church door he brought her,
  3021	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand then, as he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished
  3022	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\taway by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a
  3023	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfour-wheeler and out at the other. I think that was the chain of
  3024	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tevents, Mr. Windibank!"
  3025	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3026	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tOur visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes
  3027	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thad been talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold
  3028	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsneer upon his pale face.
  3029	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3030	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes," said he, "but if you
  3031	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tare so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is
  3032	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyou who are breaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing
  3033	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tactionable from the first, but as long as you keep that door
  3034	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlocked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal
  3035	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tconstraint."
  3036	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3037	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The law cannot, as you say, touch you," said Holmes, unlocking
  3038	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand throwing open the door, "yet there never was a man who
  3039	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdeserved punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a
  3040	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfriend, he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!"
  3041	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\the continued, flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon
  3042	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe man's face, "it is not part of my duties to my client, but
  3043	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\there's a hunting crop handy, and I think I shall just treat
  3044	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmyself to--" He took two swift steps to the whip, but before he
  3045	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcould grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs,
  3046	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe heavy hall door banged, and from the window we could see Mr.
  3047	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tJames Windibank running at the top of his speed down the road.
  3048	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3049	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"There's a cold-blooded scoundrel!" said Holmes, laughing, as he
  3050	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthrew himself down into his chair once more. "That fellow will
  3051	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trise from crime to crime until he does something very bad, and
  3052	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tends on a gallows. The case has, in some respects, been not
  3053	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tentirely devoid of interest."
  3054	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3055	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning," I
  3056	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tremarked.
  3057	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3058	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr.
  3059	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHosmer Angel must have some strong object for his curious
  3060	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tconduct, and it was equally clear that the only man who really
  3061	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tprofited by the incident, as far as we could see, was the
  3062	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstepfather. Then the fact that the two men were never together,
  3063	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbut that the one always appeared when the other was away, was
  3064	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsuggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice,
  3065	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. My
  3066	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsuspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in
  3067	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttypewriting his signature, which, of course, inferred that his
  3068	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thandwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even
  3069	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe smallest sample of it. You see all these isolated facts,
  3070	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttogether with many minor ones, all pointed in the same
  3071	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdirection."
  3072	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3073	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And how did you verify them?"
  3074	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3075	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I
  3076	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tknew the firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed
  3077	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdescription. I eliminated everything from it which could be the
  3078	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tresult of a disguise--the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I
  3079	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsent it to the firm, with a request that they would inform me
  3080	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhether it answered to the description of any of their
  3081	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttravellers. I had already noticed the peculiarities of the
  3082	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttypewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at his business
  3083	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\taddress asking him if he would come here. As I expected, his
  3084	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\treply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but
  3085	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcharacteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from
  3086	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWesthouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the
  3087	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdescription tallied in every respect with that of their employÃ©,

  3116	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3117	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Oh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been looking
  3118	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta little pale lately. I think that the change would do you good,

  3125	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tMy experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the
  3126	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\teffect of making me a prompt and ready traveller. My wants were
  3127	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfew and simple, so that in less than the time stated I was in a
  3128	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcab with my valise, rattling away to Paddington Station. Sherlock
  3129	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHolmes was pacing up and down the platform, his tall, gaunt
  3130	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfigure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey
  3131	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttravelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.
  3132	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3133	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It is really very good of you to come, Watson," said he. "It
  3134	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmakes a considerable difference to me, having someone with me on
  3135	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhom I can thoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless
  3136	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tor else biassed. If you will keep the two corner seats I shall
  3137	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tget the tickets."
  3138	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3139	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWe had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of
  3140	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpapers which Holmes had brought with him. Among these he rummaged
  3141	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand read, with intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until
  3142	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twe were past Reading. Then he suddenly rolled them all into a
  3143	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack.
  3144	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3145	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Have you heard anything of the case?" he asked.
  3146	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3147	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Not a word. I have not seen a paper for some days."
  3148	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3149	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The London press has not had very full accounts. I have just
  3150	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbeen looking through all the recent papers in order to master the
  3151	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tparticulars. It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those
  3152	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsimple cases which are so extremely difficult."
  3153	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3154	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"That sounds a little paradoxical."
  3155	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3156	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a
  3157	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tclue. The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more
  3158	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdifficult it is to bring it home. In this case, however, they

  3166	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit. I will explain the state of things to you, as far as I have
  3167	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbeen able to understand it, in a very few words.
  3168	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3169	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in
  3170	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHerefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a
  3171	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tMr. John Turner, who made his money in Australia and returned
  3172	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsome years ago to the old country. One of the farms which he
  3173	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\theld, that of Hatherley, was let to Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was
  3174	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\talso an ex-Australian. The men had known each other in the
  3175	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcolonies, so that it was not unnatural that when they came to
  3176	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsettle down they should do so as near each other as possible.
  3177	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tTurner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his
  3178	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect
  3179	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tequality, as they were frequently together. McCarthy had one son,
  3180	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta lad of eighteen, and Turner had an only daughter of the same
  3181	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tage, but neither of them had wives living. They appear to have
  3182	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tavoided the society of the neighbouring English families and to
  3183	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave led retired lives, though both the McCarthys were fond of
  3184	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of the
  3185	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tneighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants--a man and a girl.
  3186	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tTurner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the
  3187	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tleast. That is as much as I have been able to gather about the
  3188	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfamilies. Now for the facts.
  3189	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3190	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"On June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at
  3191	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the
  3192	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tBoscombe Pool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out
  3193	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof the stream which runs down the Boscombe Valley. He had been
  3194	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tout with his serving-man in the morning at Ross, and he had told
  3195	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe man that he must hurry, as he had an appointment of
  3196	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\timportance to keep at three. From that appointment he never came
  3197	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tback alive.
  3198	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3199	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"From Hatherley Farm-house to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a
  3200	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmile, and two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One
  3201	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas an old woman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was
  3202	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWilliam Crowder, a game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Turner. Both
  3203	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthese witnesses depose that Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The
  3204	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgame-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing Mr.
  3205	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tMcCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr. James McCarthy, going the
  3206	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsame way with a gun under his arm. To the best of his belief, the
  3207	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfather was actually in sight at the time, and the son was
  3208	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfollowing him. He thought no more of the matter until he heard in
  3209	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe evening of the tragedy that had occurred.
  3210	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3211	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder,
  3212	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe game-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly
  3213	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twooded round, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the
  3214	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tedge. A girl of fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of
  3215	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe lodge-keeper of the Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the
  3216	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twoods picking flowers. She states that while she was there she
  3217	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsaw, at the border of the wood and close by the lake, Mr.
  3218	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tMcCarthy and his son, and that they appeared to be having a
  3219	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tviolent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using very
  3220	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstrong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his
  3221	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by their
  3222	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tviolence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached
  3223	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thome that she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near
  3224	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tBoscombe Pool, and that she was afraid that they were going to
  3225	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfight. She had hardly said the words when young Mr. McCarthy came
  3226	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trunning up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead
  3227	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. He was
  3228	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmuch excited, without either his gun or his hat, and his right
  3229	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood. On
  3230	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfollowing him they found the dead body stretched out upon the
  3231	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgrass beside the pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated
  3232	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tblows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as
  3233	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmight very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son's
  3234	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgun, which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the
  3235	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbody. Under these circumstances the young man was instantly
  3236	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tarrested, and a verdict of 'wilful murder' having been returned
  3237	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tat the inquest on Tuesday, he was on Wednesday brought before the
  3238	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmagistrates at Ross, who have referred the case to the next
  3239	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tAssizes. Those are the main facts of the case as they came out
  3240	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbefore the coroner and the police-court."
  3241	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3242	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I could hardly imagine a more damning case," I remarked. "If
  3243	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so
  3244	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\there."
  3245	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3246	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing," answered Holmes
  3247	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthoughtfully. "It may seem to point very straight to one thing,
  3248	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbut if you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it
  3249	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something
  3250	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tentirely different. It must be confessed, however, that the case
  3251	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlooks exceedingly grave against the young man, and it is very
  3252	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpossible that he is indeed the culprit. There are several people
  3253	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin the neighbourhood, however, and among them Miss Turner, the
  3254	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdaughter of the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his
  3255	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinnocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you may recollect
  3256	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case in
  3257	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the
  3258	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcase to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are
  3259	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tflying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly
  3260	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdigesting their breakfasts at home."
  3261	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3262	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I am afraid," said I, "that the facts are so obvious that you
  3263	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twill find little credit to be gained out of this case."
  3264	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3265	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact," he
  3266	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tanswered, laughing. "Besides, we may chance to hit upon some
  3267	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tother obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to
  3268	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tMr. Lestrade. You know me too well to think that I am boasting
  3269	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhen I say that I shall either confirm or destroy his theory by
  3270	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmeans which he is quite incapable of employing, or even of
  3271	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tunderstanding. To take the first example to hand, I very clearly
  3272	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tperceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand
  3273	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tside, and yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have noted
  3274	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\teven so self-evident a thing as that."
  3275	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3276	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"How on earth--"
  3277	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3278	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"My dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness
  3279	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich characterises you. You shave every morning, and in this
  3280	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tseason you shave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less
  3281	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand less complete as we get farther back on the left side, until
  3282	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the
  3283	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tjaw, it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated
  3284	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthan the other. I could not imagine a man of your habits looking
  3285	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tat himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a
  3286	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tresult. I only quote this as a trivial example of observation and
  3287	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinference. Therein lies my mÃ©tier, and it is just possible that
  3288	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit may be of some service in the investigation which lies before
  3289	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tus. There are one or two minor points which were brought out in
  3290	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe inquest, and which are worth considering."
  3291	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3292	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What are they?"
  3293	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3294	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after

  3296	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinforming him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not
  3297	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsurprised to hear it, and that it was no more than his deserts.
  3298	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThis observation of his had the natural effect of removing any
  3299	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttraces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the
  3300	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcoroner's jury."
  3301	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3302	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It was a confession," I ejaculated.
  3303	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3304	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence."
  3305	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3306	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at
  3307	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tleast a most suspicious remark."
  3308	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3309	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"On the contrary," said Holmes, "it is the brightest rift which I
  3310	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcan at present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be,
  3311	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\the could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the
  3312	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcircumstances were very black against him. Had he appeared
  3313	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsurprised at his own arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I
  3314	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshould have looked upon it as highly suspicious, because such
  3315	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsurprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances,
  3316	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man. His
  3317	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfrank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent
  3318	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tman, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint and
  3319	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfirmness. As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not
  3320	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tunnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of
  3321	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day
  3322	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tso far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and
  3323	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\teven, according to the little girl whose evidence is so
  3324	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\timportant, to raise his hand as if to strike him. The
  3325	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tself-reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark
  3326	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tappear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a
  3327	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tguilty one."
  3328	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3329	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI shook my head. "Many men have been hanged on far slighter
  3330	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tevidence," I remarked.
  3331	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3332	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"So they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged."
  3333	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3334	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What is the young man's own account of the matter?"
  3335	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3336	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters,

  3338	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tYou will find it here, and may read it for yourself."
  3339	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3340	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHe picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire

  3342	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tparagraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own
  3343	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstatement of what had occurred. I settled myself down in the
  3344	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcorner of the carriage and read it very carefully. It ran in this

  3347	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Mr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called
  3348	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand gave evidence as follows: 'I had been away from home for
  3349	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthree days at Bristol, and had only just returned upon the
  3350	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmorning of last Monday, the 3rd. My father was absent from home at
  3351	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe time of my arrival, and I was informed by the maid that he
  3352	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thad driven over to Ross with John Cobb, the groom. Shortly after
  3353	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmy return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard, and,
  3354	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlooking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk rapidly out
  3355	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he was
  3356	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgoing. I then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of
  3357	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit
  3358	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twarren which is upon the other side. On my way I saw William
  3359	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tCrowder, the game-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but
  3360	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\the is mistaken in thinking that I was following my father. I had
  3361	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tno idea that he was in front of me. When about a hundred yards
  3362	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfrom the pool I heard a cry of "Cooee!" which was a usual signal
  3363	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbetween my father and myself. I then hurried forward, and found
  3364	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thim standing by the pool. He appeared to be much surprised at
  3365	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tseeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was doing there. A
  3366	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tconversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows,
  3367	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfor my father was a man of a very violent temper. Seeing that his
  3368	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpassion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and returned
  3369	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttowards Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards,
  3370	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thowever, when I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me
  3371	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto run back again. I found my father expiring upon the ground,
  3372	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twith his head terribly injured. I dropped my gun and held him in
  3373	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmy arms, but he almost instantly expired. I knelt beside him for
  3374	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsome minutes, and then made my way to Mr. Turner's lodge-keeper,
  3375	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this house being the nearest, to ask for assistance. I saw no one
  3376	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnear my father when I returned, and I have no idea how he came by
  3377	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this injuries. He was not a popular man, being somewhat cold and
  3378	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tforbidding in his manners, but he had, as far as I know, no
  3379	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tactive enemies. I know nothing further of the matter.'

  3462	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trefusal to give details of his conversation with his father, and
  3463	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this singular account of his father's dying words. They are all,

  3466	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHolmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon
  3467	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe cushioned seat. "Both you and the coroner have been at some
  3468	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpains," said he, "to single out the very strongest points in the
  3469	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyoung man's favour. Don't you see that you alternately give him
  3470	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcredit for having too much imagination and too little? Too
  3471	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlittle, if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would
  3472	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgive him the sympathy of the jury; too much, if he evolved from

  3475	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsir, I shall approach this case from the point of view that what
  3476	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthis young man says is true, and we shall see whither that
  3477	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thypothesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket Petrarch, and
  3478	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnot another word shall I say of this case until we are on the
  3479	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tscene of action. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be
  3480	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthere in twenty minutes."

  3482	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tIt was nearly four o'clock when we at last, after passing through
  3483	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe beautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn,
  3484	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfound ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A
  3485	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlean, ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for
  3486	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tus upon the platform. In spite of the light brown dustcoat and
  3487	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tleather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic
  3488	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsurroundings, I had no difficulty in recognising Lestrade, of
  3489	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tScotland Yard. With him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a
  3490	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\troom had already been engaged for us.
  3491	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3492	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I have ordered a carriage," said Lestrade as we sat over a cup
  3493	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof tea. "I knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be
  3494	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thappy until you had been on the scene of the crime."
  3495	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3496	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It was very nice and complimentary of you," Holmes answered. "It
  3497	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tis entirely a question of barometric pressure."
  3498	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3499	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tLestrade looked startled. "I do not quite follow," he said.
  3500	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3501	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"How is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud
  3502	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin the sky. I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need
  3503	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsmoking, and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country
  3504	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thotel abomination. I do not think that it is probable that I
  3505	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshall use the carriage to-night."
  3506	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3507	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tLestrade laughed indulgently. "You have, no doubt, already formed
  3508	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyour conclusions from the newspapers," he said. "The case is as
  3509	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tplain as a pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer
  3510	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit becomes. Still, of course, one can't refuse a lady, and such a
  3511	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvery positive one, too. She has heard of you, and would have your
  3512	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\topinion, though I repeatedly told her that there was nothing
  3513	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich you could do which I had not already done. Why, bless my
  3514	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsoul! here is her carriage at the door."
  3515	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3516	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHe had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the
  3517	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmost lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. Her
  3518	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tviolet eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her
  3519	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcheeks, all thought of her natural reserve lost in her
  3520	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\toverpowering excitement and concern.
  3521	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3522	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!" she cried, glancing from one to the
  3523	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tother of us, and finally, with a woman's quick intuition,
  3524	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfastening upon my companion, "I am so glad that you have come. I
  3525	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave driven down to tell you so. I know that James didn't do it.
  3526	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI know it, and I want you to start upon your work knowing it,
  3527	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttoo. Never let yourself doubt upon that point. We have known each
  3528	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tother since we were little children, and I know his faults as no
  3529	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tone else does; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly. Such a
  3530	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcharge is absurd to anyone who really knows him."
  3531	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3532	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner," said Sherlock Holmes.
  3533	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You may rely upon my doing all that I can."
  3534	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3535	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion?
  3536	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tDo you not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself
  3537	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthink that he is innocent?"
  3538	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3539	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I think that it is very probable."
  3540	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3541	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"There, now!" she cried, throwing back her head and looking
  3542	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdefiantly at Lestrade. "You hear! He gives me hopes."
  3543	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3544	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tLestrade shrugged his shoulders. "I am afraid that my colleague
  3545	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thas been a little quick in forming his conclusions," he said.
  3546	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3547	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did
  3548	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit. And about his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the
  3549	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\treason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because
  3550	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI was concerned in it."
  3551	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3552	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"In what way?" asked Holmes.
  3553	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3554	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had
  3555	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmany disagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that
  3556	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthere should be a marriage between us. James and I have always
  3557	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tloved each other as brother and sister; but of course he is young
  3558	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand has seen very little of life yet, and--and--well, he
  3559	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnaturally did not wish to do anything like that yet. So there
  3560	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twere quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of them."
  3561	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3562	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And your father?" asked Holmes. "Was he in favour of such a
  3563	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tunion?"
  3564	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3565	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in
  3566	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfavour of it." A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as
  3567	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHolmes shot one of his keen, questioning glances at her.
  3568	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3569	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Thank you for this information," said he. "May I see your father
  3570	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tif I call to-morrow?"
  3571	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3572	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I am afraid the doctor won't allow it."
  3573	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3574	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The doctor?"
  3575	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3576	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for
  3577	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyears back, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken
  3578	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto his bed, and Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck and that his
  3579	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnervous system is shattered. Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive
  3580	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twho had known dad in the old days in Victoria."
  3581	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3582	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Ha! In Victoria! That is important."
  3583	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3584	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, at the mines."
  3585	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3586	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Quite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner

  3588	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3589	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, certainly."
  3590	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3591	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Thank you, Miss Turner. You have been of material assistance to
  3592	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tme."
  3593	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3594	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you
  3595	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twill go to the prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do
  3596	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttell him that I know him to be innocent."
  3597	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3598	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I will, Miss Turner."
  3599	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3600	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if
  3601	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI leave him. Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking." She
  3602	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we
  3603	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\theard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.
  3604	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3605	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I am ashamed of you, Holmes," said Lestrade with dignity after a
  3606	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfew minutes' silence. "Why should you raise up hopes which you
  3607	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tare bound to disappoint? I am not over-tender of heart, but I
  3608	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcall it cruel."
  3609	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3610	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy," said
  3611	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHolmes. "Have you an order to see him in prison?"
  3612	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3613	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, but only for you and me."
  3614	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3615	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Then I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have
  3616	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstill time to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night?"
  3617	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3618	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Ample."
  3619	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3620	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Then let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very
  3621	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tslow, but I shall only be away a couple of hours."
  3622	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3623	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through
  3624	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe streets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel,
  3625	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhere I lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a
  3626	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyellow-backed novel. The puny plot of the story was so thin,
  3627	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thowever, when compared to the deep mystery through which we were
  3628	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgroping, and I found my attention wander so continually from the
  3629	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\taction to the fact, that I at last flung it across the room and
  3630	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the
  3631	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tday. Supposing that this unhappy young man's story were
  3632	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tabsolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely
  3633	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tunforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between
  3634	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe time when he parted from his father, and the moment when,
  3635	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdrawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was
  3636	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsomething terrible and deadly. What could it be? Might not the
  3637	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts?
  3638	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper, which
  3639	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcontained a verbatim account of the inquest. In the surgeon's
  3640	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdeposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left
  3641	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tparietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been
  3642	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked the spot
  3643	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tupon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck from
  3644	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbehind. That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when
  3645	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tseen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it
  3646	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdid not go for very much, for the older man might have turned his
  3647	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tback before the blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call
  3648	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHolmes' attention to it. Then there was the peculiar dying
  3649	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\treference to a rat. What could that mean? It could not be
  3650	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdelirium. A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become
  3651	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdelirious. No, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how
  3652	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\the met his fate. But what could it indicate? I cudgelled my
  3653	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbrains to find some possible explanation. And then the incident
  3654	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true the
  3655	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmurderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his
  3656	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tovercoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to
  3657	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\treturn and to carry it away at the instant when the son was
  3658	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tkneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off. What a
  3659	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was! I
  3660	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdid not wonder at Lestrade's opinion, and yet I had so much faith
  3661	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin Sherlock Holmes' insight that I could not lose hope as long
  3662	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tas every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young
  3663	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tMcCarthy's innocence.
  3664	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3665	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tIt was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone,
  3666	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfor Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.
  3667	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3668	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The glass still keeps very high," he remarked as he sat down.
  3669	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It is of importance that it should not rain before we are able
  3670	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto go over the ground. On the other hand, a man should be at his
  3671	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvery best and keenest for such nice work as that, and I did not
  3672	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twish to do it when fagged by a long journey. I have seen young
  3673	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tMcCarthy."
  3674	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3675	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And what did you learn from him?"
  3676	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3677	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Nothing."
  3678	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3679	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Could he throw no light?"
  3680	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3681	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"None at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew
  3682	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twho had done it and was screening him or her, but I am convinced
  3683	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnow that he is as puzzled as everyone else. He is not a very
  3684	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tquick-witted youth, though comely to look at and, I should think,
  3685	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsound at heart."
  3686	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3687	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I cannot admire his taste," I remarked, "if it is indeed a fact
  3688	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as
  3689	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthis Miss Turner."
  3690	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3691	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly,
  3692	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinsanely, in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was
  3693	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tonly a lad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away
  3694	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfive years at a boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get
  3695	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinto the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol and marry her at a
  3696	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tregistry office? No one knows a word of the matter, but you can
  3697	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\timagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not
  3698	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdoing what he would give his very eyes to do, but what he knows
  3699	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto be absolutely impossible. It was sheer frenzy of this sort
  3700	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich made him throw his hands up into the air when his father,
  3701	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tat their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss
  3702	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tTurner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself,
  3703	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand his father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would
  3704	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave thrown him over utterly had he known the truth. It was with
  3705	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in
  3706	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tBristol, and his father did not know where he was. Mark that
  3707	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpoint. It is of importance. Good has come out of evil, however,
  3708	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfor the barmaid, finding from the papers that he is in serious
  3709	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttrouble and likely to be hanged, has thrown him over utterly and
  3710	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thas written to him to say that she has a husband already in the
  3711	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tBermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between them. I
  3712	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthink that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all
  3713	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat he has suffered."
  3714	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3715	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But if he is innocent, who has done it?"
  3716	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3717	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Ah! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two
  3718	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpoints. One is that the murdered man had an appointment with
  3719	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsomeone at the pool, and that the someone could not have been his
  3720	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tson, for his son was away, and he did not know when he would
  3721	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\treturn. The second is that the murdered man was heard to cry
  3722	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t'Cooee!' before he knew that his son had returned. Those are the
  3723	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcrucial points upon which the case depends. And now let us talk
  3724	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tabout George Meredith, if you please, and we shall leave all
  3725	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tminor matters until to-morrow."
  3726	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3727	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThere was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke
  3728	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbright and cloudless. At nine o'clock Lestrade called for us with
  3729	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe
  3730	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tPool.
  3731	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3732	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"There is serious news this morning," Lestrade observed. "It is
  3733	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsaid that Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is
  3734	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdespaired of."
  3735	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3736	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"An elderly man, I presume?" said Holmes.
  3737	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3738	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life
  3739	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tabroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. This
  3740	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbusiness has had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend
  3741	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof McCarthy's, and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I
  3742	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm rent free."
  3743	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3744	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Indeed! That is interesting," said Holmes.
  3745	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3746	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Oh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody
  3747	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tabout here speaks of his kindness to him."
  3748	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3749	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Really! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this
  3750	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tMcCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have
  3751	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbeen under such obligations to Turner, should still talk of
  3752	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmarrying his son to Turner's daughter, who is, presumably,
  3753	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\theiress to the estate, and that in such a very cocksure manner,
  3754	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tas if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would
  3755	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfollow? It is the more strange, since we know that Turner himself
  3756	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas averse to the idea. The daughter told us as much. Do you not
  3757	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdeduce something from that?"
  3758	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3759	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"We have got to the deductions and the inferences," said
  3760	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tLestrade, winking at me. "I find it hard enough to tackle facts,
  3761	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHolmes, without flying away after theories and fancies."
  3762	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3763	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You are right," said Holmes demurely; "you do find it very hard
  3764	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto tackle the facts."
  3765	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3766	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it
  3767	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdifficult to get hold of," replied Lestrade with some warmth.
  3768	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3769	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And that is--"
  3770	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3771	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"That McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that
  3772	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tall theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine."
  3773	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3774	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog," said Holmes,
  3775	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlaughing. "But I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley
  3776	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tFarm upon the left."
  3777	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3778	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, that is it." It was a widespread, comfortable-looking
  3779	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbuilding, two-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches
  3780	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof lichen upon the grey walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless
  3781	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tchimneys, however, gave it a stricken look, as though the weight
  3782	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof this horror still lay heavy upon it. We called at the door,
  3783	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhen the maid, at Holmes' request, showed us the boots which her
  3784	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmaster wore at the time of his death, and also a pair of the
  3785	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tson's, though not the pair which he had then had. Having measured
  3786	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthese very carefully from seven or eight different points, Holmes
  3787	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdesired to be led to the court-yard, from which we all followed
  3788	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe winding track which led to Boscombe Pool.
  3789	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3790	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent
  3791	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tas this. Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of
  3792	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tBaker Street would have failed to recognise him. His face flushed
  3793	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand darkened. His brows were drawn into two hard black lines,
  3794	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhile his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter.
  3795	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHis face was bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips
  3796	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcompressed, and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long,
  3797	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsinewy neck. His nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal
  3798	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutely concentrated
  3799	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tupon the matter before him that a question or remark fell
  3800	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tunheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick,
  3801	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\timpatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way
  3802	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\talong the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of
  3803	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe woods to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is
  3804	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tall that district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon
  3805	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either
  3806	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tside. Sometimes Holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and
  3807	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tonce he made quite a little detour into the meadow. Lestrade and
  3808	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI walked behind him, the detective indifferent and contemptuous,
  3809	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhile I watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the
  3810	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tconviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a
  3811	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdefinite end.
  3812	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3813	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water
  3814	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsome fifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the
  3815	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHatherley Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner.
  3816	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tAbove the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see
  3817	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe red, jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich
  3818	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlandowner's dwelling. On the Hatherley side of the pool the woods
  3819	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgrew very thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass
  3820	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttwenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds
  3821	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich lined the lake. Lestrade showed us the exact spot at which
  3822	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was the ground,
  3823	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat I could plainly see the traces which had been left by the
  3824	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager
  3825	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tface and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read
  3826	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tupon the trampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking
  3827	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tup a scent, and then turned upon my companion.
  3828	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3829	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What did you go into the pool for?" he asked.
  3830	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3831	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon
  3832	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tor other trace. But how on earth--"
  3833	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3834	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its
  3835	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinward twist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and
  3836	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthere it vanishes among the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all
  3837	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave been had I been here before they came like a herd of buffalo
  3838	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand wallowed all over it. Here is where the party with the
  3839	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlodge-keeper came, and they have covered all tracks for six or
  3840	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\teight feet round the body. But here are three separate tracks of
  3841	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe same feet." He drew out a lens and lay down upon his
  3842	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twaterproof to have a better view, talking all the time rather to
  3843	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thimself than to us. "These are young McCarthy's feet. Twice he
  3844	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles are
  3845	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdeeply marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears out his
  3846	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstory. He ran when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are
  3847	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe father's feet as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It
  3848	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tis the butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. And this?
  3849	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHa, ha! What have we here? Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite
  3850	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tunusual boots! They come, they go, they come again--of course
  3851	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat was for the cloak. Now where did they come from?" He ran up
  3852	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track until we
  3853	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twere well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a
  3854	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgreat beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes traced
  3855	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon
  3856	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this face with a little cry of satisfaction. For a long time he
  3857	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tremained there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks,
  3858	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and
  3859	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\texamining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of
  3860	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe tree as far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among
  3861	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe moss, and this also he carefully examined and retained. Then
  3862	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\the followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the
  3863	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thighroad, where all traces were lost.
  3864	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3865	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It has been a case of considerable interest," he remarked,
  3866	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\treturning to his natural manner. "I fancy that this grey house on
  3867	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe right must be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a
  3868	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tword with Moran, and perhaps write a little note. Having done
  3869	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat, we may drive back to our luncheon. You may walk to the cab,
  3870	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand I shall be with you presently."
  3871	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3872	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tIt was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove
  3873	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tback into Ross, Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he
  3874	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thad picked up in the wood.
  3875	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3876	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"This may interest you, Lestrade," he remarked, holding it out.
  3877	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The murder was done with it."
  3878	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3879	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I see no marks."
  3880	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3881	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"There are none."
  3882	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3883	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"How do you know, then?"
  3884	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3885	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The grass was growing under it. It had only lain there a few
  3886	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdays. There was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It
  3887	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcorresponds with the injuries. There is no sign of any other
  3888	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tweapon."
  3889	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3890	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And the murderer?"
  3891	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3892	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears
  3893	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthick-soled shooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes Indian
  3894	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcigars, uses a cigar-holder, and carries a blunt pen-knife in his
  3895	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpocket. There are several other indications, but these may be
  3896	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tenough to aid us in our search."
  3897	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3898	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tLestrade laughed. "I am afraid that I am still a sceptic," he
  3899	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsaid. "Theories are all very well, but we have to deal with a
  3900	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thard-headed British jury."
  3901	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3902	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Nous verrons," answered Holmes calmly. "You work your own
  3903	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmethod, and I shall work mine. I shall be busy this afternoon,
  3904	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand shall probably return to London by the evening train."
  3905	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3906	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And leave your case unfinished?"
  3907	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3908	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No, finished."
  3909	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3910	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But the mystery?"
  3911	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3912	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It is solved."
  3913	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3914	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Who was the criminal, then?"
  3915	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3916	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The gentleman I describe."
  3917	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3918	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But who is he?"
  3919	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3920	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Surely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such a
  3921	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpopulous neighbourhood."
  3922	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3923	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tLestrade shrugged his shoulders. "I am a practical man," he said,
  3924	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"and I really cannot undertake to go about the country looking
  3925	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfor a left-handed gentleman with a game leg. I should become the
  3926	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlaughing-stock of Scotland Yard."
  3927	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3928	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"All right," said Holmes quietly. "I have given you the chance.
  3929	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHere are your lodgings. Good-bye. I shall drop you a line before
  3930	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI leave."
  3931	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3932	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHaving left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where
  3933	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twe found lunch upon the table. Holmes was silent and buried in
  3934	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthought with a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds
  3935	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thimself in a perplexing position.
  3936	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3937	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Look here, Watson," he said when the cloth was cleared "just sit
  3938	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdown in this chair and let me preach to you for a little. I don't
  3939	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tknow quite what to do, and I should value your advice. Light a
  3940	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcigar and let me expound."
  3941	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3942	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t "Pray do so."
  3943	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3944	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, now, in considering this case there are two points about
  3945	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyoung McCarthy's narrative which struck us both instantly,
  3946	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\talthough they impressed me in his favour and you against him. One
  3947	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas the fact that his father should, according to his account,
  3948	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcry 'Cooee!' before seeing him. The other was his singular dying
  3949	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\treference to a rat. He mumbled several words, you understand, but
  3950	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat was all that caught the son's ear. Now from this double
  3951	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpoint our research must commence, and we will begin it by
  3952	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpresuming that what the lad says is absolutely true."
  3953	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3954	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What of this 'Cooee!' then?"
  3955	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3956	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. The
  3957	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tson, as far as he knew, was in Bristol. It was mere chance that
  3958	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\the was within earshot. The 'Cooee!' was meant to attract the
  3959	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tattention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with. But
  3960	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t'Cooee' is a distinctly Australian cry, and one which is used
  3961	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbetween Australians. There is a strong presumption that the
  3962	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tperson whom McCarthy expected to meet him at Boscombe Pool was
  3963	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsomeone who had been in Australia."
  3964	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3965	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What of the rat, then?"
  3966	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3967	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened
  3968	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit out on the table. "This is a map of the Colony of Victoria,"
  3969	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\the said. "I wired to Bristol for it last night." He put his hand
  3970	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tover part of the map. "What do you read?"
  3971	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3972	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"ARAT," I read.
  3973	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3974	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And now?" He raised his hand.
  3975	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3976	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"BALLARAT."
  3977	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3978	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Quite so. That was the word the man uttered, and of which his
  3979	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tson only caught the last two syllables. He was trying to utter
  3980	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe name of his murderer. So and so, of Ballarat."
  3981	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3982	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It is wonderful!" I exclaimed.
  3983	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3984	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It is obvious. And now, you see, I had narrowed the field down
  3985	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tconsiderably. The possession of a grey garment was a third point
  3986	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich, granting the son's statement to be correct, was a
  3987	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcertainty. We have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite
  3988	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tconception of an Australian from Ballarat with a grey cloak."
  3989	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3990	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Certainly."
  3991	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3992	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And one who was at home in the district, for the pool can only
  3993	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbe approached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could
  3994	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thardly wander."
  3995	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3996	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Quite so."
  3997	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  3998	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Then comes our expedition of to-day. By an examination of the
  3999	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tground I gained the trifling details which I gave to that
  4000	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\timbecile Lestrade, as to the personality of the criminal."
  4001	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4002	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But how did you gain them?"
  4003	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4004	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You know my method. It is founded upon the observation of
  4005	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttrifles."
  4006	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4007	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"His height I know that you might roughly judge from the length
  4008	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof his stride. His boots, too, might be told from their traces."
  4009	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4010	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, they were peculiar boots."
  4011	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4012	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But his lameness?"
  4013	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4014	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The impression of his right foot was always less distinct than
  4015	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this left. He put less weight upon it. Why? Because he limped--he
  4016	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas lame."
  4017	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4018	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But his left-handedness."
  4019	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4020	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded
  4021	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tby the surgeon at the inquest. The blow was struck from
  4022	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\timmediately behind, and yet was upon the left side. Now, how can
  4023	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat be unless it were by a left-handed man? He had stood behind
  4024	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat tree during the interview between the father and son. He had
  4025	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\teven smoked there. I found the ash of a cigar, which my special
  4026	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tknowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an Indian
  4027	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcigar. I have, as you know, devoted some attention to this, and
  4028	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twritten a little monograph on the ashes of 140 different
  4029	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvarieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco. Having found the
  4030	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tash, I then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss
  4031	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhere he had tossed it. It was an Indian cigar, of the variety
  4032	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich are rolled in Rotterdam."
  4033	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4034	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And the cigar-holder?"
  4035	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4036	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I could see that the end had not been in his mouth. Therefore he
  4037	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tused a holder. The tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the
  4038	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcut was not a clean one, so I deduced a blunt pen-knife."
  4039	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4040	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Holmes," I said, "you have drawn a net round this man from which
  4041	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\the cannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as
  4042	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttruly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him. I see the
  4043	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdirection in which all this points. The culprit is--"
  4044	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4045	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Mr. John Turner," cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of
  4046	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tour sitting-room, and ushering in a visitor.
  4047	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4048	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. His
  4049	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tslow, limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of
  4050	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdecrepitude, and yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and
  4051	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual
  4052	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstrength of body and of character. His tangled beard, grizzled
  4053	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thair, and outstanding, drooping eyebrows combined to give an air
  4054	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof dignity and power to his appearance, but his face was of an
  4055	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tashen white, while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were
  4056	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttinged with a shade of blue. It was clear to me at a glance that
  4057	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\the was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease.
  4058	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4059	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Pray sit down on the sofa," said Holmes gently. "You had my
  4060	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnote?"
  4061	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4062	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to

  4064	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t

  4066	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4067	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And why did you wish to see me?" He looked across at my
  4068	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcompanion with despair in his weary eyes, as though his question
  4069	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas already answered.
  4070	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4071	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes," said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words. "It
  4072	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tis so. I know all about McCarthy."
  4073	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4074	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe old man sank his face in his hands. "God help me!" he cried.
  4075	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But I would not have let the young man come to harm. I give you
  4076	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmy word that I would have spoken out if it went against him at
  4077	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe Assizes."
  4078	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4079	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I am glad to hear you say so," said Holmes gravely.
  4080	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4081	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It
  4082	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twould break her heart--it will break her heart when she hears
  4083	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat I am arrested."
  4084	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4085	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It may not come to that," said Holmes.
  4086	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4087	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What?"
  4088	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4089	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter
  4090	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twho required my presence here, and I am acting in her interests.
  4091	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tYoung McCarthy must be got off, however."
  4092	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4093	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I am a dying man," said old Turner. "I have had diabetes for
  4094	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyears. My doctor says it is a question whether I shall live a
  4095	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmonth. Yet I would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol."
  4096	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4097	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHolmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand
  4098	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand a bundle of paper before him. "Just tell us the truth," he
  4099	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsaid. "I shall jot down the facts. You will sign it, and Watson
  4100	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\there can witness it. Then I could produce your confession at the
  4101	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlast extremity to save young McCarthy. I promise you that I shall
  4102	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnot use it unless it is absolutely needed."
  4103	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4104	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It's as well," said the old man; "it's a question whether I
  4105	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshall live to the Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I
  4106	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshould wish to spare Alice the shock. And now I will make the
  4107	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthing clear to you; it has been a long time in the acting, but
  4108	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twill not take me long to tell.

  4112	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsuch a man as he. His grip has been upon me these twenty years,
  4113	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand he has blasted my life. I'll tell you first how I came to be

  4116	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It was in the early '60's at the diggings. I was a young chap
  4117	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthen, hot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at
  4118	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tanything; I got among bad companions, took to drink, had no luck
  4119	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twith my claim, took to the bush, and in a word became what you
  4120	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twould call over here a highway robber. There were six of us, and
  4121	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twe had a wild, free life of it, sticking up a station from time
  4122	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto time, or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings.
  4123	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tBlack Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under, and our party
  4124	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tis still remembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang.
  4125	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4126	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and
  4127	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twe lay in wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers
  4128	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand six of us, so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of
  4129	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttheir saddles at the first volley. Three of our boys were killed,
  4130	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thowever, before we got the swag. I put my pistol to the head of
  4131	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe wagon-driver, who was this very man McCarthy. I wish to the
  4132	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tLord that I had shot him then, but I spared him, though I saw his
  4133	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twicked little eyes fixed on my face, as though to remember every
  4134	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfeature. We got away with the gold, became wealthy men, and made
  4135	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tour way over to England without being suspected. There I parted
  4136	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfrom my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and
  4137	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trespectable life. I bought this estate, which chanced to be in
  4138	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money,
  4139	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto make up for the way in which I had earned it. I married, too,
  4140	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand though my wife died young she left me my dear little Alice.
  4141	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tEven when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down
  4142	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe right path as nothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned
  4143	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tover a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past. All was
  4144	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgoing well when McCarthy laid his grip upon me.
  4145	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4146	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in
  4147	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tRegent Street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his
  4148	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfoot.

  4152	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyou can have the keeping of us. If you don't--it's a fine,
  4153	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlaw-abiding country is England, and there's always a policeman
  4154	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twithin hail.'
  4155	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4156	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking
  4157	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthem off, and there they have lived rent free on my best land
  4158	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tever since. There was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness;
  4159	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tturn where I would, there was his cunning, grinning face at my
  4160	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\telbow. It grew worse as Alice grew up, for he soon saw I was more
  4161	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tafraid of her knowing my past than of the police. Whatever he
  4162	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twanted he must have, and whatever it was I gave him without
  4163	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tquestion, land, money, houses, until at last he asked a thing
  4164	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich I could not give. He asked for Alice.
  4165	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4166	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"His son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was
  4167	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tknown to be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that
  4168	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this lad should step into the whole property. But there I was
  4169	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfirm. I would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that
  4170	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI had any dislike to the lad, but his blood was in him, and that
  4171	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas enough. I stood firm. McCarthy threatened. I braved him to do
  4172	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this worst. We were to meet at the pool midway between our houses
  4173	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto talk it over.
  4174	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4175	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"When I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I
  4176	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsmoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone.
  4177	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tBut as I listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in
  4178	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tme seemed to come uppermost. He was urging his son to marry my
  4179	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdaughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she
  4180	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twere a slut from off the streets. It drove me mad to think that I
  4181	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand all that I held most dear should be in the power of such a
  4182	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tman as this. Could I not snap the bond? I was already a dying and
  4183	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta desperate man. Though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb,
  4184	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI knew that my own fate was sealed. But my memory and my girl!
  4185	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tBoth could be saved if I could but silence that foul tongue. I
  4186	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdid it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it again. Deeply as I have sinned,
  4187	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But that my girl
  4188	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshould be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more
  4189	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthan I could suffer. I struck him down with no more compunction
  4190	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthan if he had been some foul and venomous beast. His cry brought
  4191	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tback his son; but I had gained the cover of the wood, though I
  4192	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas forced to go back to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in
  4193	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmy flight. That is the true story, gentlemen, of all that
  4194	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\toccurred."
  4195	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4196	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, it is not for me to judge you," said Holmes as the old man
  4197	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsigned the statement which had been drawn out. "I pray that we
  4198	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmay never be exposed to such a temptation."
  4199	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4200	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I pray not, sir. And what do you intend to do?"
  4201	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4202	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"In view of your health, nothing. You are yourself aware that you
  4203	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twill soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the
  4204	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tAssizes. I will keep your confession, and if McCarthy is
  4205	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcondemned I shall be forced to use it. If not, it shall never be
  4206	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tseen by mortal eye; and your secret, whether you be alive or
  4207	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdead, shall be safe with us."
  4208	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4209	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Farewell, then," said the old man solemnly. "Your own deathbeds,
  4210	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhen they come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace
  4211	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich you have given to mine." Tottering and shaking in all his
  4212	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgiant frame, he stumbled slowly from the room.
  4213	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4214	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"God help us!" said Holmes after a long silence. "Why does fate
  4215	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tplay such tricks with poor, helpless worms? I never hear of such
  4216	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta case as this that I do not think of Baxter's words, and say,

  4221	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsubmitted to the defending counsel. Old Turner lived for seven
  4222	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmonths after our interview, but he is now dead; and there is
  4223	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tevery prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily

  4230	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4231	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWhen I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes
  4232	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcases between the years '82 and '90, I am faced by so many which
  4233	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpresent strange and interesting features that it is no easy
  4234	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmatter to know which to choose and which to leave. Some, however,
  4235	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave already gained publicity through the papers, and others have
  4236	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnot offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend
  4237	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpossessed in so high a degree, and which it is the object of
  4238	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthese papers to illustrate. Some, too, have baffled his
  4239	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tanalytical skill, and would be, as narratives, beginnings without
  4240	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tan ending, while others have been but partially cleared up, and
  4241	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and
  4242	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsurmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to
  4243	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thim. There is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable
  4244	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin its details and so startling in its results that I am tempted
  4245	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are
  4246	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpoints in connection with it which never have been, and probably
  4247	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnever will be, entirely cleared up.
  4248	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4249	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe year '87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater
  4250	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tor less interest, of which I retain the records. Among my
  4251	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\theadings under this one twelve months I find an account of the
  4252	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tadventure of the Paradol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant
  4253	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSociety, who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a
  4254	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfurniture warehouse, of the facts connected with the loss of the
  4255	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tBritish barque "Sophy Anderson", of the singular adventures of the
  4256	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tGrice Patersons in the island of Uffa, and finally of the
  4257	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tCamberwell poisoning case. In the latter, as may be remembered,
  4258	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man's watch, to
  4259	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tprove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that
  4260	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttherefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time--a
  4261	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdeduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the
  4262	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcase. All these I may sketch out at some future date, but none of
  4263	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthem present such singular features as the strange train of
  4264	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcircumstances which I have now taken up my pen to describe.
  4265	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4266	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tIt was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales
  4267	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thad set in with exceptional violence. All day the wind had
  4268	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tscreamed and the rain had beaten against the windows, so that
  4269	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\teven here in the heart of great, hand-made London we were forced
  4270	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and
  4271	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto recognise the presence of those great elemental forces which
  4272	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation, like
  4273	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tuntamed beasts in a cage. As evening drew in, the storm grew
  4274	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thigher and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in
  4275	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side of the
  4276	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while I at the
  4277	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tother was deep in one of Clark Russell's fine sea-stories until
  4278	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text,
  4279	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of
  4280	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe sea waves. My wife was on a visit to her mother's, and for a
  4281	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfew days I was a dweller once more in my old quarters at Baker
  4282	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tStreet.
  4283	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4284	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Why," said I, glancing up at my companion, "that was surely the
  4285	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbell. Who could come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?"
  4286	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4287	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Except yourself I have none," he answered. "I do not encourage

  4289	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4290	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"A client, then?"
  4291	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t

  4294	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlikely to be some crony of the landlady's."

  4296	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there
  4297	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcame a step in the passage and a tapping at the door. He
  4298	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and
  4299	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttowards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit.
  4300	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4301	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Come in!" said he.
  4302	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4303	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the
  4304	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\toutside, well-groomed and trimly clad, with something of
  4305	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trefinement and delicacy in his bearing. The streaming umbrella
  4306	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich he held in his hand, and his long shining waterproof told
  4307	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof the fierce weather through which he had come. He looked about
  4308	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thim anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and I could see that his
  4309	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tface was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a man who is
  4310	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tweighed down with some great anxiety.
  4311	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4312	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I owe you an apology," he said, raising his golden pince-nez to
  4313	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this eyes. "I trust that I am not intruding. I fear that I have
  4314	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbrought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug
  4315	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tchamber."
  4316	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4317	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Give me your coat and umbrella," said Holmes. "They may rest
  4318	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\there on the hook and will be dry presently. You have come up from
  4319	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe south-west, I see."
  4320	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4321	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, from Horsham."
  4322	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4323	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is

  4325	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4326	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I have come for advice."
  4327	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4328	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"That is easily got."
  4329	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4330	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And help."
  4331	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4332	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"That is not always so easy."
  4333	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4334	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I heard from Major Prendergast

  4336	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4337	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Ah, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards."
  4338	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4339	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"He said that you could solve anything."
  4340	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t

  4342	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t

  4344	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4345	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I have been beaten four times--three times by men, and once by a

  4347	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4348	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But what is that compared with the number of your successes?"
  4349	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4350	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It is true that I have been generally successful."
  4351	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t

  4353	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4354	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me

  4356	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4357	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It is no ordinary one."
  4358	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4359	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"None of those which come to me are. I am the last court of

  4361	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4362	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you

  4364	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tevents than those which have happened in my own family."
  4365	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4366	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You fill me with interest," said Holmes. "Pray give us the

  4368	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tquestion you as to those details which seem to me to be most
  4369	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\timportant."
  4370	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4371	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out

  4373	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4374	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"My name," said he, "is John Openshaw, but my own affairs have,
  4375	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tas far as I can understand, little to do with this awful
  4376	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbusiness. It is a hereditary matter; so in order to give you an
  4377	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tidea of the facts, I must go back to the commencement of the
  4378	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\taffair.
  4379	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4380	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You must know that my grandfather had two sons--my uncle Elias
  4381	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand my father Joseph. My father had a small factory at Coventry,
  4382	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling. He
  4383	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas a patentee of the Openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business
  4384	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmet with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire
  4385	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tupon a handsome competence.
  4386	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4387	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and
  4388	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbecame a planter in Florida, where he was reported to have done
  4389	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvery well. At the time of the war he fought in Jackson's army,
  4390	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand afterwards under Hood, where he rose to be a colonel. When
  4391	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tLee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation, where
  4392	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\the remained for three or four years. About 1869 or 1870 he came
  4393	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tback to Europe and took a small estate in Sussex, near Horsham.
  4394	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHe had made a very considerable fortune in the States, and his
  4395	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\treason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes, and his
  4396	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdislike of the Republican policy in extending the franchise to
  4397	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthem. He was a singular man, fierce and quick-tempered, very
  4398	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfoul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most retiring
  4399	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdisposition. During all the years that he lived at Horsham, I
  4400	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdoubt if ever he set foot in the town. He had a garden and two or
  4401	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthree fields round his house, and there he would take his
  4402	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\texercise, though very often for weeks on end he would never leave
  4403	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this room. He drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very
  4404	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\theavily, but he would see no society and did not want any
  4405	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfriends, not even his own brother.
  4406	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4407	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"He didn't mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the
  4408	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttime when he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so. This
  4409	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twould be in the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years
  4410	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin England. He begged my father to let me live with him and he
  4411	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas very kind to me in his way. When he was sober he used to be
  4412	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfond of playing backgammon and draughts with me, and he would
  4413	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmake me his representative both with the servants and with the
  4414	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttradespeople, so that by the time that I was sixteen I was quite
  4415	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmaster of the house. I kept all the keys and could go where I
  4416	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tliked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb him in
  4417	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this privacy. There was one singular exception, however, for he
  4418	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thad a single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was
  4419	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinvariably locked, and which he would never permit either me or
  4420	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tanyone else to enter. With a boy's curiosity I have peeped
  4421	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthrough the keyhole, but I was never able to see more than such a
  4422	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcollection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such
  4423	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta room.
  4424	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4425	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"One day--it was in March, 1883--a letter with a foreign stamp
  4426	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlay upon the table in front of the colonel's plate. It was not a
  4427	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcommon thing for him to receive letters, for his bills were all
  4428	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpaid in ready money, and he had no friends of any sort. 'From
  4429	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tIndia!' said he as he took it up, 'Pondicherry postmark! What can
  4430	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthis be?' Opening it hurriedly, out there jumped five little
  4431	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdried orange pips, which pattered down upon his plate. I began to
  4432	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlaugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight
  4433	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes were protruding, his
  4434	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tskin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope which he
  4435	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstill held in his trembling hand, 'K. K. K.!' he shrieked, and
  4436	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthen, 'My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!'
  4437	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4438	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'What is it, uncle?' I cried.
  4439	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4440	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Death,' said he, and rising from the table he retired to his
  4441	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\troom, leaving me palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope
  4442	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the
  4443	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgum, the letter K three times repeated. There was nothing else
  4444	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsave the five dried pips. What could be the reason of his
  4445	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\toverpowering terror? I left the breakfast-table, and as I
  4446	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tascended the stair I met him coming down with an old rusty key,
  4447	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich must have belonged to the attic, in one hand, and a small
  4448	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbrass box, like a cashbox, in the other.
  4449	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4450	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'They may do what they like, but I'll checkmate them still,'
  4451	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsaid he with an oath. 'Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my
  4452	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\troom to-day, and send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.'
  4453	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4454	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to
  4455	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstep up to the room. The fire was burning brightly, and in the
  4456	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgrate there was a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned
  4457	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpaper, while the brass box stood open and empty beside it. As I
  4458	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tglanced at the box I noticed, with a start, that upon the lid was
  4459	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tprinted the treble K which I had read in the morning upon the
  4460	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tenvelope.

  4462	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'I wish you, John,' said my uncle, 'to witness my will. I leave
  4463	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmy estate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages, to
  4464	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmy brother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to
  4465	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyou. If you can enjoy it in peace, well and good! If you find you
  4466	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcannot, take my advice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest
  4467	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tenemy. I am sorry to give you such a two-edged thing, but I can't
  4468	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsay what turn things are going to take. Kindly sign the paper
  4469	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhere Mr. Fordham shows you.'
  4470	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4471	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with
  4472	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thim. The singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest
  4473	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\timpression upon me, and I pondered over it and turned it every
  4474	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tway in my mind without being able to make anything of it. Yet I
  4475	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcould not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left
  4476	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbehind, though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed
  4477	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives. I
  4478	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcould see a change in my uncle, however. He drank more than ever,
  4479	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand he was less inclined for any sort of society. Most of his
  4480	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttime he would spend in his room, with the door locked upon the
  4481	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy
  4482	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a
  4483	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trevolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of no man,
  4484	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by
  4485	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tman or devil. When these hot fits were over, however, he would
  4486	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him,
  4487	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlike a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror
  4488	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich lies at the roots of his soul. At such times I have seen
  4489	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this face, even on a cold day, glisten with moisture, as though it
  4490	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twere new raised from a basin.
  4491	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4492	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to
  4493	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tabuse your patience, there came a night when he made one of those
  4494	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdrunken sallies from which he never came back. We found him, when
  4495	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twe went to search for him, face downward in a little
  4496	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgreen-scummed pool, which lay at the foot of the garden. There
  4497	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas no sign of any violence, and the water was but two feet deep,
  4498	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tso that the jury, having regard to his known eccentricity,
  4499	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbrought in a verdict of 'suicide.' But I, who knew how he winced
  4500	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfrom the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade myself
  4501	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat he had gone out of his way to meet it. The matter passed,
  4502	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thowever, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and
  4503	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof some 14,000 pounds, which lay to his credit at the bank."

  4516	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trequest, made a careful examination of the attic, which had been
  4517	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\talways locked up. We found the brass box there, although its
  4518	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcontents had been destroyed. On the inside of the cover was a

  4520	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t'Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register' written beneath.

  4524	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tscattered papers and note-books bearing upon my uncle's life in
  4525	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tAmerica. Some of them were of the war time and showed that he had

  4527	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tOthers were of a date during the reconstruction of the Southern

  4531	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4532	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, it was the beginning of '84 when my father came to live at
  4533	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHorsham, and all went as well as possible with us until the
  4534	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tJanuary of '85. On the fourth day after the new year I heard my
  4535	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfather give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the
  4536	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbreakfast-table. There he was, sitting with a newly opened
  4537	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tenvelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the
  4538	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\toutstretched palm of the other one. He had always laughed at what
  4539	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\the called my cock-and-bull story about the colonel, but he looked
  4540	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvery scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon
  4541	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thimself.
  4542	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4543	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Why, what on earth does this mean, John?' he stammered.
  4544	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4545	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"My heart had turned to lead. 'It is K. K. K.,' said I.
  4546	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4547	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"He looked inside the envelope. 'So it is,' he cried. 'Here are
  4548	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe very letters. But what is this written above them?'
  4549	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4550	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Put the papers on the sundial,' I read, peeping over his
  4551	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshoulder.
  4552	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4553	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'What papers? What sundial?' he asked.
  4554	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4555	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'The sundial in the garden. There is no other,' said I; 'but the
  4556	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpapers must be those that are destroyed.'
  4557	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4558	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Pooh!' said he, gripping hard at his courage. 'We are in a
  4559	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcivilised land here, and we can't have tomfoolery of this kind.
  4560	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWhere does the thing come from?'
  4561	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4562	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'From Dundee,' I answered, glancing at the postmark.

  4564	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Some preposterous practical joke,' said he. 'What have I to do
  4565	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twith sundials and papers? I shall take no notice of such
  4566	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnonsense.'

  4568	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'I should certainly speak to the police,' I said.

  4576	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4577	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate
  4578	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tman. I went about, however, with a heart which was full of
  4579	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tforebodings.
  4580	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4581	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"On the third day after the coming of the letter my father went
  4582	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfrom home to visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is
  4583	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin command of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad
  4584	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat he should go, for it seemed to me that he was farther from
  4585	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdanger when he was away from home. In that, however, I was in
  4586	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\terror. Upon the second day of his absence I received a telegram
  4587	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfrom the major, imploring me to come at once. My father had
  4588	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound in the
  4589	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tneighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull. I
  4590	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered
  4591	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this consciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning from
  4592	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tFareham in the twilight, and as the country was unknown to him,
  4593	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand the chalk-pit unfenced, the jury had no hesitation in
  4594	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbringing in a verdict of 'death from accidental causes.'
  4595	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tCarefully as I examined every fact connected with his death, I
  4596	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of
  4597	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmurder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no
  4598	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trobbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads.
  4599	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tAnd yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease,
  4600	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand that I was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been
  4601	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twoven round him.
  4602	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4603	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"In this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask me
  4604	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhy I did not dispose of it? I answer, because I was well
  4605	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tconvinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an
  4606	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tincident in my uncle's life, and that the danger would be as
  4607	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpressing in one house as in another.
  4608	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4609	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It was in January, '85, that my poor father met his end, and two
  4610	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyears and eight months have elapsed since then. During that time
  4611	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI have lived happily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope that
  4612	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthis curse had passed away from the family, and that it had ended
  4613	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twith the last generation. I had begun to take comfort too soon,
  4614	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thowever; yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in
  4615	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich it had come upon my father."
  4616	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4617	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and
  4618	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tturning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried
  4619	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\torange pips.
  4620	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4621	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"This is the envelope," he continued. "The postmark is
  4622	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tLondon--eastern division. Within are the very words which were
  4623	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tupon my father's last message: 'K. K. K.'; and then 'Put the
  4624	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpapers on the sundial.'"
  4625	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4626	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What have you done?" asked Holmes.
  4627	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4628	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Nothing."
  4629	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4630	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Nothing?"
  4631	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4632	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"To tell the truth"--he sank his face into his thin, white
  4633	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thands--"I have felt helpless. I have felt like one of those poor
  4634	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trabbits when the snake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in
  4635	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe grasp of some resistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight
  4636	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand no precautions can guard against."
  4637	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4638	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Tut! tut!" cried Sherlock Holmes. "You must act, man, or you are
  4639	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlost. Nothing but energy can save you. This is no time for
  4640	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdespair."
  4641	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4642	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I have seen the police."
  4643	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4644	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Ah!"
  4645	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4646	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But they listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced that
  4647	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all
  4648	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpractical jokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really
  4649	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\taccidents, as the jury stated, and were not to be connected with
  4650	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe warnings."
  4651	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4652	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHolmes shook his clenched hands in the air. "Incredible
  4653	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\timbecility!" he cried.
  4654	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4655	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"They have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in
  4656	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe house with me."
  4657	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4658	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Has he come with you to-night?"
  4659	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4660	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No. His orders were to stay in the house."
  4661	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4662	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tAgain Holmes raved in the air.
  4663	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4664	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Why did you come to me," he cried, "and, above all, why did you
  4665	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnot come at once?"
  4666	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4667	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major
  4668	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tPrendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to
  4669	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyou."
  4670	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4671	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It is really two days since you had the letter. We should have
  4672	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tacted before this. You have no further evidence, I suppose, than
  4673	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat which you have placed before us--no suggestive detail which
  4674	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmight help us?"
  4675	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4676	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"There is one thing," said John Openshaw. He rummaged in his coat
  4677	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpocket, and, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-tinted
  4678	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpaper, he laid it out upon the table. "I have some remembrance,"
  4679	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsaid he, "that on the day when my uncle burned the papers I
  4680	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tobserved that the small, unburned margins which lay amid the
  4681	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tashes were of this particular colour. I found this single sheet
  4682	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tupon the floor of his room, and I am inclined to think that it
  4683	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmay be one of the papers which has, perhaps, fluttered out from
  4684	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tamong the others, and in that way has escaped destruction. Beyond
  4685	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us much. I think
  4686	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmyself that it is a page from some private diary. The writing is
  4687	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tundoubtedly my uncle's."
  4688	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4689	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHolmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper,
  4690	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from
  4691	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta book. It was headed, "March, 1869," and beneath were the
  4692	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfollowing enigmatical notices:

  4694	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.
  4695	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t

  4704	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4705	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Thank you!" said Holmes, folding up the paper and returning it
  4706	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto our visitor. "And now you must on no account lose another
  4707	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinstant. We cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told
  4708	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tme. You must get home instantly and act."
  4709	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4710	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What shall I do?"
  4711	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4712	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"There is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. You must
  4713	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tput this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass
  4714	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbox which you have described. You must also put in a note to say
  4715	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat all the other papers were burned by your uncle, and that
  4716	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthis is the only one which remains. You must assert that in such
  4717	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twords as will carry conviction with them. Having done this, you
  4718	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmust at once put the box out upon the sundial, as directed. Do
  4719	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyou understand?"
  4720	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4721	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Entirely."
  4722	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4723	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Do not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. I
  4724	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthink that we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our
  4725	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tweb to weave, while theirs is already woven. The first
  4726	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tconsideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens
  4727	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyou. The second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the

  4729	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4730	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I thank you," said the young man, rising and pulling on his
  4731	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tovercoat. "You have given me fresh life and hope. I shall

  4733	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4734	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Do not lose an instant. And, above all, take care of yourself in

  4753	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t

  4757	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pattered
  4758	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tagainst the windows. This strange, wild story seemed to have come

  4767	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t

  4777	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But have you," I asked, "formed any definite conception as to
  4778	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhat these perils are?"
  4779	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4780	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"There can be no question as to their nature," he answered.
  4781	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4782	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Then what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why does he pursue
  4783	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthis unhappy family?"
  4784	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4785	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the
  4786	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tarms of his chair, with his finger-tips together. "The ideal
  4787	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\treasoner," he remarked, "would, when he had once been shown a
  4788	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsingle fact in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all the
  4789	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tchain of events which led up to it but also all the results which
  4790	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twould follow from it. As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole
  4791	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tanimal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who
  4792	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thas thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents
  4793	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshould be able to accurately state all the other ones, both
  4794	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbefore and after. We have not yet grasped the results which the
  4795	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\treason alone can attain to. Problems may be solved in the study
  4796	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the
  4797	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\taid of their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest
  4798	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpitch, it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to
  4799	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tutilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge; and this
  4800	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin itself implies, as you will readily see, a possession of all
  4801	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tknowledge, which, even in these days of free education and
  4802	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tencyclopaedias, is a somewhat rare accomplishment. It is not so
  4803	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\timpossible, however, that a man should possess all knowledge
  4804	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich is likely to be useful to him in his work, and this I have
  4805	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tendeavoured in my case to do. If I remember rightly, you on one
  4806	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\toccasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my limits
  4807	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin a very precise fashion."
  4808	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4809	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes," I answered, laughing. "It was a singular document.
  4810	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tPhilosophy, astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I
  4811	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tremember. Botany variable, geology profound as regards the
  4812	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmud-stains from any region within fifty miles of town, chemistry
  4813	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\teccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational literature and crime
  4814	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trecords unique, violin-player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and
  4815	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tself-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. Those, I think, were the
  4816	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmain points of my analysis."
  4817	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4818	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHolmes grinned at the last item. "Well," he said, "I say now, as
  4819	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI said then, that a man should keep his little brain-attic
  4820	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use, and the
  4821	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trest he can put away in the lumber-room of his library, where he
  4822	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcan get it if he wants it. Now, for such a case as the one which
  4823	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thas been submitted to us to-night, we need certainly to muster
  4824	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tall our resources. Kindly hand me down the letter K of the
  4825	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t'American Encyclopaedia' which stands upon the shelf beside you.
  4826	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThank you. Now let us consider the situation and see what may be
  4827	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdeduced from it. In the first place, we may start with a strong
  4828	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpresumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason for
  4829	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tleaving America. Men at his time of life do not change all their
  4830	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thabits and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for
  4831	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe lonely life of an English provincial town. His extreme love
  4832	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof solitude in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of
  4833	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsomeone or something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis
  4834	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat it was fear of someone or something which drove him from
  4835	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tAmerica. As to what it was he feared, we can only deduce that by
  4836	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tconsidering the formidable letters which were received by himself
  4837	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand his successors. Did you remark the postmarks of those
  4838	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tletters?"
  4839	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4840	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the
  4841	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthird from London."
  4842	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4843	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"From East London. What do you deduce from that?"
  4844	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4845	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"They are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a ship."
  4846	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4847	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Excellent. We have already a clue. There can be no doubt that
  4848	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe probability--the strong probability--is that the writer was
  4849	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ton board of a ship. And now let us consider another point. In the
  4850	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcase of Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and
  4851	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tits fulfilment, in Dundee it was only some three or four days.
  4852	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tDoes that suggest anything?"
  4853	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4854	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"A greater distance to travel."
  4855	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4856	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But the letter had also a greater distance to come."
  4857	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4858	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Then I do not see the point."
  4859	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4860	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man
  4861	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tor men are is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they always send
  4862	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttheir singular warning or token before them when starting upon
  4863	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttheir mission. You see how quickly the deed followed the sign
  4864	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhen it came from Dundee. If they had come from Pondicherry in a
  4865	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsteamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter.
  4866	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tBut, as a matter of fact, seven weeks elapsed. I think that those
  4867	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tseven weeks represented the difference between the mail-boat which
  4868	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbrought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the
  4869	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twriter."
  4870	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4871	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It is possible."
  4872	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4873	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"More than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly
  4874	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\turgency of this new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to
  4875	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcaution. The blow has always fallen at the end of the time which
  4876	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit would take the senders to travel the distance. But this one
  4877	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcomes from London, and therefore we cannot count upon delay."
  4878	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4879	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Good God!" I cried. "What can it mean, this relentless
  4880	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpersecution?"
  4881	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4882	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital
  4883	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\timportance to the person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think
  4884	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them.
  4885	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tA single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way
  4886	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tas to deceive a coroner's jury. There must have been several in
  4887	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit, and they must have been men of resource and determination.
  4888	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tTheir papers they mean to have, be the holder of them who it may.
  4889	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tIn this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be the initials of an
  4890	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tindividual and becomes the badge of a society."
  4891	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4892	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But of what society?"
  4893	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4894	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Have you never--" said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and
  4895	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsinking his voice--"have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?"
  4896	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4897	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I never have."
  4898	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4899	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHolmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. "Here it
  4900	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tis," said he presently:
  4901	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4902	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to
  4903	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe sound produced by cocking a rifle. This terrible secret
  4904	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsociety was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the
  4905	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSouthern states after the Civil War, and it rapidly formed local
  4906	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbranches in different parts of the country, notably in Tennessee,
  4907	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tLouisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Its power was
  4908	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tused for political purposes, principally for the terrorising of
  4909	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country
  4910	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof those who were opposed to its views. Its outrages were usually
  4911	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpreceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic
  4912	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbut generally recognised shape--a sprig of oak-leaves in some
  4913	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tparts, melon seeds or orange pips in others. On receiving this
  4914	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe victim might either openly abjure his former ways, or might
  4915	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfly from the country. If he braved the matter out, death would
  4916	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tunfailingly come upon him, and usually in some strange and
  4917	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tunforeseen manner. So perfect was the organisation of the
  4918	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsociety, and so systematic its methods, that there is hardly a
  4919	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcase upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with
  4920	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\timpunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the
  4921	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tperpetrators. For some years the organisation flourished in spite
  4922	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof the efforts of the United States government and of the better
  4923	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tclasses of the community in the South. Eventually, in the year
  4924	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t1869, the movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have
  4925	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbeen sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.'
  4926	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4927	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You will observe," said Holmes, laying down the volume, "that
  4928	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the
  4929	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdisappearance of Openshaw from America with their papers. It may
  4930	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twell have been cause and effect. It is no wonder that he and his
  4931	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfamily have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track.
  4932	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tYou can understand that this register and diary may implicate
  4933	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsome of the first men in the South, and that there may be many
  4934	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twho will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered."
  4935	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4936	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Then the page we have seen--"
  4937	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4938	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Is such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, 'sent
  4939	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe pips to A, B, and C'--that is, sent the society's warning to
  4940	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthem. Then there are successive entries that A and B cleared, or
  4941	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tleft the country, and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a
  4942	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsinister result for C. Well, I think, Doctor, that we may let
  4943	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsome light into this dark place, and I believe that the only
  4944	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tchance young Openshaw has in the meantime is to do what I have
  4945	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttold him. There is nothing more to be said or to be done

  4969	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4970	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tAs I waited, I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and
  4971	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tglanced my eye over it. It rested upon a heading which sent a

  4973	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4974	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Holmes," I cried, "you are too late."

  4978	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4979	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"My eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading 'Tragedy
  4980	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tNear Waterloo Bridge.' Here is the account:
  4981	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  4982	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook, of the H
  4983	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tDivision, on duty near Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help and
  4984	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta splash in the water. The night, however, was extremely dark and
  4985	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstormy, so that, in spite of the help of several passers-by, it
  4986	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas quite impossible to effect a rescue. The alarm, however, was
  4987	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgiven, and, by the aid of the water-police, the body was
  4988	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\teventually recovered. It proved to be that of a young gentleman
  4989	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhose name, as it appears from an envelope which was found in his
  4990	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpocket, was John Openshaw, and whose residence is near Horsham.
  4991	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tIt is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch
  4992	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe last train from Waterloo Station, and that in his haste and
  4993	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge
  4994	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof one of the small landing-places for river steamboats. The body
  4995	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\texhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt that
  4996	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident,
  4997	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich should have the effect of calling the attention of the

  5013	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthey have decoyed him down there? The Embankment is not on the
  5014	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdirect line to the station. The bridge, no doubt, was too
  5015	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcrowded, even on such a night, for their purpose. Well, Watson,
  5016	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twe shall see who will win in the long run. I am going out now!"
  5017	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5018	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"To the police?"
  5019	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5020	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No; I shall be my own police. When I have spun the web they may

  5022	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5023	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tAll day I was engaged in my professional work, and it was late in
  5024	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe evening before I returned to Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes
  5025	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thad not come back yet. It was nearly ten o'clock before he
  5026	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tentered, looking pale and worn. He walked up to the sideboard,
  5027	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously,
  5028	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twashing it down with a long draught of water.
  5029	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5030	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You are hungry," I remarked.
  5031	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5032	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Starving. It had escaped my memory. I have had nothing since

  5034	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5035	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Nothing?"
  5036	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5037	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Not a bite. I had no time to think of it."
  5038	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5039	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And how have you succeeded?"
  5040	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5041	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well."
  5042	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5043	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You have a clue?"
  5044	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5045	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I have them in the hollow of my hand. Young Openshaw shall not
  5046	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlong remain unavenged. Why, Watson, let us put their own devilish
  5047	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttrade-mark upon them. It is well thought of!"
  5048	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t

  5050	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t

  5053	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthrust them into an envelope. On the inside of the flap he wrote
  5054	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"S. H. for J. O." Then he sealed it and addressed it to "Captain

  5056	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5057	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"That will await him when he enters port," said he, chuckling.
  5058	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It may give him a sleepless night. He will find it as sure a

  5061	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And who is this Captain Calhoun?"
  5062	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5063	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first."

  5065	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"How did you trace it, then?"
  5066	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5067	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHe took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with

  5069	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5070	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I have spent the whole day," said he, "over Lloyd's registers

  5072	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvessel which touched at Pondicherry in January and February in
  5073	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t'83. There were thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were
  5074	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\treported there during those months. Of these, one, the 'Lone Star,'
  5075	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinstantly attracted my attention, since, although it was reported
  5076	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tas having cleared from London, the name is that which is given to
  5077	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tone of the states of the Union."

  5083	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5084	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What then?"
  5085	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5086	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the barque
  5087	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t'Lone Star' was there in January, '85, my suspicion became a
  5088	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcertainty. I then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present

  5090	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5091	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes?"
  5092	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5093	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The 'Lone Star' had arrived here last week. I went down to the

  5095	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe early tide this morning, homeward bound to Savannah. I wired
  5096	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto Gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago, and
  5097	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tas the wind is easterly I have no doubt that she is now past the

  5099	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5100	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What will you do, then?"
  5101	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5102	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Oh, I have my hand upon him. He and the two mates, are as I

  5104	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tFinns and Germans. I know, also, that they were all three away
  5105	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfrom the ship last night. I had it from the stevedore who has
  5106	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbeen loading their cargo. By the time that their sailing-ship
  5107	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\treaches Savannah the mail-boat will have carried this letter, and
  5108	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe cable will have informed the police of Savannah that these

  5115	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsevere were the equinoctial gales that year. We waited long for
  5116	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnews of the "Lone Star" of Savannah, but none ever reached us. We
  5117	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdid at last hear that somewhere far out in the Atlantic a
  5118	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshattered stern-post of a boat was seen swinging in the trough
  5119	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof a wave, with the letters "L. S." carved upon it, and that is

  5124	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP
  5125	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5126	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tIsa Whitney, brother of the late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal
  5127	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof the Theological College of St. George's, was much addicted to
  5128	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\topium. The habit grew upon him, as I understand, from some
  5129	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfoolish freak when he was at college; for having read De
  5130	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tQuincey's description of his dreams and sensations, he had
  5131	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdrenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the
  5132	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsame effects. He found, as so many more have done, that the
  5133	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpractice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many
  5134	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyears he continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of
  5135	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives. I can see
  5136	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thim now, with yellow, pasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point
  5137	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpupils, all huddled in a chair, the wreck and ruin of a noble
  5138	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tman.
  5139	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5140	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tOne night--it was in June, '89--there came a ring to my bell,
  5141	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tabout the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the
  5142	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tclock. I sat up in my chair, and my wife laid her needle-work
  5143	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdown in her lap and made a little face of disappointment.
  5144	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5145	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"A patient!" said she. "You'll have to go out."
  5146	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5147	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day.
  5148	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5149	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWe heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps
  5150	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tupon the linoleum. Our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in
  5151	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsome dark-coloured stuff, with a black veil, entered the room.
  5152	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5153	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You will excuse my calling so late," she began, and then,
  5154	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsuddenly losing her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms
  5155	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tabout my wife's neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. "Oh, I'm in
  5156	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsuch trouble!" she cried; "I do so want a little help."
  5157	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5158	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Why," said my wife, pulling up her veil, "it is Kate Whitney.
  5159	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHow you startled me, Kate! I had not an idea who you were when
  5160	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyou came in."
  5161	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5162	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I didn't know what to do, so I came straight to you." That was
  5163	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\talways the way. Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds
  5164	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto a light-house.
  5165	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5166	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine
  5167	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand water, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. Or
  5168	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshould you rather that I sent James off to bed?"
  5169	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5170	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Oh, no, no! I want the doctor's advice and help, too. It's about
  5171	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tIsa. He has not been home for two days. I am so frightened about
  5172	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thim!"
  5173	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5174	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tIt was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her
  5175	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thusband's trouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend
  5176	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand school companion. We soothed and comforted her by such words
  5177	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tas we could find. Did she know where her husband was? Was it
  5178	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpossible that we could bring him back to her?
  5179	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5180	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tIt seems that it was. She had the surest information that of late
  5181	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\the had, when the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the
  5182	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfarthest east of the City. Hitherto his orgies had always been
  5183	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tconfined to one day, and he had come back, twitching and
  5184	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshattered, in the evening. But now the spell had been upon him
  5185	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\teight-and-forty hours, and he lay there, doubtless among the
  5186	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdregs of the docks, breathing in the poison or sleeping off the
  5187	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\teffects. There he was to be found, she was sure of it, at the Bar
  5188	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane. But what was she to do? How could
  5189	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshe, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a place and
  5190	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him?
  5191	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5192	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThere was the case, and of course there was but one way out of
  5193	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit. Might I not escort her to this place? And then, as a second
  5194	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthought, why should she come at all? I was Isa Whitney's medical
  5195	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tadviser, and as such I had influence over him. I could manage it
  5196	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbetter if I were alone. I promised her on my word that I would
  5197	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsend him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the
  5198	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\taddress which she had given me. And so in ten minutes I had left
  5199	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmy armchair and cheery sitting-room behind me, and was speeding
  5200	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\teastward in a hansom on a strange errand, as it seemed to me at
  5201	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe time, though the future only could show how strange it was to
  5202	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbe.
  5203	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5204	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tBut there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my
  5205	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tadventure. Upper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the
  5206	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thigh wharves which line the north side of the river to the east
  5207	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof London Bridge. Between a slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached
  5208	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tby a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the
  5209	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmouth of a cave, I found the den of which I was in search.
  5210	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tOrdering my cab to wait, I passed down the steps, worn hollow in
  5211	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet; and by the
  5212	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlight of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found the latch
  5213	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy with the
  5214	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbrown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the
  5215	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tforecastle of an emigrant ship.
  5216	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5217	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThrough the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying
  5218	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin strange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads
  5219	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthrown back, and chins pointing upward, with here and there a
  5220	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdark, lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer. Out of the black
  5221	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshadows there glimmered little red circles of light, now bright,
  5222	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnow faint, as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of
  5223	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe metal pipes. The most lay silent, but some muttered to
  5224	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthemselves, and others talked together in a strange, low,
  5225	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmonotonous voice, their conversation coming in gushes, and then
  5226	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsuddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling out his own
  5227	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour. At
  5228	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal, beside
  5229	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old
  5230	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tman, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon
  5231	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this knees, staring into the fire.
  5232	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5233	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tAs I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe
  5234	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfor me and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.
  5235	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5236	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Thank you. I have not come to stay," said I. "There is a friend
  5237	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof mine here, Mr. Isa Whitney, and I wish to speak with him."
  5238	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5239	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThere was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and
  5240	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpeering through the gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and
  5241	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tunkempt, staring out at me.
  5242	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5243	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"My God! It's Watson," said he. He was in a pitiable state of
  5244	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\treaction, with every nerve in a twitter. "I say, Watson, what
  5245	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\to'clock is it?"
  5246	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5247	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Nearly eleven."

  5249	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Of what day?"
  5250	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5251	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Of Friday, June 19th."
  5252	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5253	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Good heavens! I thought it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What
  5254	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\td'you want to frighten a chap for?" He sank his face onto his
  5255	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tarms and began to sob in a high treble key.
  5256	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5257	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been waiting
  5258	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthis two days for you. You should be ashamed of yourself!"
  5259	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5260	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"So I am. But you've got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here
  5261	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta few hours, three pipes, four pipes--I forget how many. But I'll
  5262	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgo home with you. I wouldn't frighten Kate--poor little Kate.
  5263	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tGive me your hand! Have you a cab?"
  5264	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5265	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, I have one waiting."
  5266	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5267	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Then I shall go in it. But I must owe something. Find what I
  5268	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\towe, Watson. I am all off colour. I can do nothing for myself."
  5269	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5270	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI walked down the narrow passage between the double row of
  5271	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsleepers, holding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying
  5272	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfumes of the drug, and looking about for the manager. As I passed
  5273	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe tall man who sat by the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my
  5274	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tskirt, and a low voice whispered, "Walk past me, and then look
  5275	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tback at me." The words fell quite distinctly upon my ear. I
  5276	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tglanced down. They could only have come from the old man at my
  5277	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tside, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever, very thin, very
  5278	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down from between
  5279	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his
  5280	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfingers. I took two steps forward and looked back. It took all my
  5281	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tself-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of
  5282	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tastonishment. He had turned his back so that none could see him
  5283	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbut I. His form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull
  5284	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\teyes had regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and
  5285	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgrinning at my surprise, was none other than Sherlock Holmes. He
  5286	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmade a slight motion to me to approach him, and instantly, as he
  5287	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tturned his face half round to the company once more, subsided
  5288	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinto a doddering, loose-lipped senility.
  5289	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5290	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Holmes!" I whispered, "what on earth are you doing in this den?"
  5291	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5292	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"As low as you can," he answered; "I have excellent ears. If you
  5293	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twould have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend
  5294	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof yours I should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with
  5295	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyou."
  5296	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5297	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I have a cab outside."
  5298	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5299	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Then pray send him home in it. You may safely trust him, for he
  5300	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tappears to be too limp to get into any mischief. I should
  5301	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trecommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to
  5302	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsay that you have thrown in your lot with me. If you will wait
  5303	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\toutside, I shall be with you in five minutes."
  5304	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5305	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tIt was difficult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes' requests, for
  5306	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthey were always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with
  5307	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsuch a quiet air of mastery. I felt, however, that when Whitney
  5308	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas once confined in the cab my mission was practically
  5309	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\taccomplished; and for the rest, I could not wish anything better
  5310	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthan to be associated with my friend in one of those singular
  5311	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tadventures which were the normal condition of his existence. In a
  5312	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfew minutes I had written my note, paid Whitney's bill, led him
  5313	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tout to the cab, and seen him driven through the darkness. In a
  5314	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvery short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den,
  5315	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand I was walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes. For two
  5316	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstreets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot.
  5317	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThen, glancing quickly round, he straightened himself out and
  5318	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tburst into a hearty fit of laughter.
  5319	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5320	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I suppose, Watson," said he, "that you imagine that I have added
  5321	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\topium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little
  5322	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tweaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical
  5323	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tviews."
  5324	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5325	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I was certainly surprised to find you there."
  5326	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5327	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But not more so than I to find you."
  5328	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5329	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I came to find a friend."
  5330	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5331	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And I to find an enemy."
  5332	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5333	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"An enemy?"
  5334	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5335	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural
  5336	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tprey. Briefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkable
  5337	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinquiry, and I have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent
  5338	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tramblings of these sots, as I have done before now. Had I been
  5339	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trecognised in that den my life would not have been worth an
  5340	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thour's purchase; for I have used it before now for my own
  5341	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpurposes, and the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to have
  5342	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvengeance upon me. There is a trap-door at the back of that
  5343	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbuilding, near the corner of Paul's Wharf, which could tell some
  5344	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstrange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless
  5345	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnights."
  5346	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5347	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What! You do not mean bodies?"
  5348	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5349	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Ay, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had 1000 pounds
  5350	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfor every poor devil who has been done to death in that den. It
  5351	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tis the vilest murder-trap on the whole riverside, and I fear that
  5352	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tNeville St. Clair has entered it never to leave it more. But our
  5353	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttrap should be here." He put his two forefingers between his
  5354	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tteeth and whistled shrilly--a signal which was answered by a
  5355	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsimilar whistle from the distance, followed shortly by the rattle
  5356	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof wheels and the clink of horses' hoofs.
  5357	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5358	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Now, Watson," said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through
  5359	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe gloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from
  5360	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tits side lanterns. "You'll come with me, won't you?"
  5361	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5362	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"If I can be of use."
  5363	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5364	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Oh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still
  5365	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmore so. My room at The Cedars is a double-bedded one."
  5366	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5367	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The Cedars?"
  5368	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5369	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes; that is Mr. St. Clair's house. I am staying there while I
  5370	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tconduct the inquiry."
  5371	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5372	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Where is it, then?"
  5373	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5374	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Near Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile drive before us."
  5375	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5376	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But I am all in the dark."
  5377	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5378	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Of course you are. You'll know all about it presently. Jump up
  5379	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\there. All right, John; we shall not need you. Here's half a
  5380	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcrown. Look out for me to-morrow, about eleven. Give her her
  5381	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thead. So long, then!"
  5382	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5383	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHe flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through
  5384	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe endless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which
  5385	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twidened gradually, until we were flying across a broad
  5386	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbalustraded bridge, with the murky river flowing sluggishly
  5387	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbeneath us. Beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and
  5388	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmortar, its silence broken only by the heavy, regular footfall of
  5389	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe policeman, or the songs and shouts of some belated party of
  5390	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trevellers. A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky, and a
  5391	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstar or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of
  5392	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe clouds. Holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his
  5393	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbreast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while I sat
  5394	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbeside him, curious to learn what this new quest might be which
  5395	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tseemed to tax his powers so sorely, and yet afraid to break in
  5396	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tupon the current of his thoughts. We had driven several miles,
  5397	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban
  5398	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvillas, when he shook himself, shrugged his shoulders, and lit up
  5399	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he
  5400	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tis acting for the best.
  5401	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5402	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You have a grand gift of silence, Watson," said he. "It makes
  5403	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyou quite invaluable as a companion. 'Pon my word, it is a great
  5404	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthing for me to have someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are
  5405	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnot over-pleasant. I was wondering what I should say to this dear
  5406	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlittle woman to-night when she meets me at the door."
  5407	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5408	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You forget that I know nothing about it."
  5409	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5410	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before
  5411	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twe get to Lee. It seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow I can
  5412	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tget nothing to go upon. There's plenty of thread, no doubt, but I
  5413	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcan't get the end of it into my hand. Now, I'll state the case
  5414	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tclearly and concisely to you, Watson, and maybe you can see a
  5415	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tspark where all is dark to me."
  5416	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5417	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Proceed, then."
  5418	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5419	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Some years ago--to be definite, in May, 1884--there came to Lee
  5420	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta gentleman, Neville St. Clair by name, who appeared to have
  5421	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tplenty of money. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very
  5422	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnicely, and lived generally in good style. By degrees he made
  5423	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfriends in the neighbourhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter
  5424	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof a local brewer, by whom he now has two children. He had no
  5425	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\toccupation, but was interested in several companies and went into
  5426	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttown as a rule in the morning, returning by the 5:14 from Cannon
  5427	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tStreet every night. Mr. St. Clair is now thirty-seven years of
  5428	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tage, is a man of temperate habits, a good husband, a very
  5429	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\taffectionate father, and a man who is popular with all who know
  5430	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thim. I may add that his whole debts at the present moment, as far
  5431	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tas we have been able to ascertain, amount to 88 pounds 10s., while
  5432	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\the has 220 pounds standing to his credit in the Capital and
  5433	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tCounties Bank. There is no reason, therefore, to think that money
  5434	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttroubles have been weighing upon his mind.
  5435	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5436	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Last Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier
  5437	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthan usual, remarking before he started that he had two important
  5438	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcommissions to perform, and that he would bring his little boy
  5439	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thome a box of bricks. Now, by the merest chance, his wife
  5440	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\treceived a telegram upon this same Monday, very shortly after his
  5441	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdeparture, to the effect that a small parcel of considerable
  5442	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvalue which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the
  5443	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\toffices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company. Now, if you are well up
  5444	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin your London, you will know that the office of the company is
  5445	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin Fresno Street, which branches out of Upper Swandam Lane, where
  5446	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyou found me to-night. Mrs. St. Clair had her lunch, started for
  5447	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe City, did some shopping, proceeded to the company's office,
  5448	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgot her packet, and found herself at exactly 4:35 walking through
  5449	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSwandam Lane on her way back to the station. Have you followed me
  5450	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tso far?"
  5451	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5452	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It is very clear."

  5460	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto her from a second-floor window. The window was open, and she
  5461	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdistinctly saw his face, which she describes as being terribly
  5462	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tagitated. He waved his hands frantically to her, and then
  5463	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that
  5464	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\the had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind.
  5465	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tOne singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that
  5466	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\talthough he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town
  5467	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin, he had on neither collar nor necktie.

  5471	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyou found me to-night--and running through the front room she
  5472	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tattempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor. At

  5475	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tacts as assistant there, pushed her out into the street. Filled
  5476	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twith the most maddening doubts and fears, she rushed down the
  5477	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlane and, by rare good-fortune, met in Fresno Street a number of

  5482	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsign of him there. In fact, in the whole of that floor there was
  5483	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tno one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who,
  5484	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit seems, made his home there. Both he and the Lascar stoutly
  5485	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tswore that no one else had been in the front room during the
  5486	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tafternoon. So determined was their denial that the inspector was
  5487	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstaggered, and had almost come to believe that Mrs. St. Clair had
  5488	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbeen deluded when, with a cry, she sprang at a small deal box
  5489	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich lay upon the table and tore the lid from it. Out there fell
  5490	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta cascade of children's bricks. It was the toy which he had
  5491	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpromised to bring home.
  5492	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5493	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"This discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple
  5494	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshowed, made the inspector realise that the matter was serious.
  5495	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe rooms were carefully examined, and results all pointed to an
  5496	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tabominable crime. The front room was plainly furnished as a
  5497	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsitting-room and led into a small bedroom, which looked out upon
  5498	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe back of one of the wharves. Between the wharf and the bedroom
  5499	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twindow is a narrow strip, which is dry at low tide but is covered
  5500	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tat high tide with at least four and a half feet of water. The
  5501	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbedroom window was a broad one and opened from below. On
  5502	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\texamination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill,
  5503	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of
  5504	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe bedroom. Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were
  5505	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tall the clothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the exception of
  5506	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this coat. His boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch--all were
  5507	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthere. There were no signs of violence upon any of these
  5508	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgarments, and there were no other traces of Mr. Neville St.
  5509	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tClair. Out of the window he must apparently have gone for no
  5510	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tother exit could be discovered, and the ominous bloodstains upon
  5511	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe sill gave little promise that he could save himself by
  5512	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tswimming, for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of
  5513	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe tragedy.
  5514	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5515	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately
  5516	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\timplicated in the matter. The Lascar was known to be a man of the
  5517	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvilest antecedents, but as, by Mrs. St. Clair's story, he was
  5518	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tknown to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few
  5519	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tseconds of her husband's appearance at the window, he could
  5520	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thardly have been more than an accessory to the crime. His defence
  5521	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that he had no
  5522	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tknowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and that he
  5523	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcould not account in any way for the presence of the missing
  5524	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgentleman's clothes.
  5525	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5526	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"So much for the Lascar manager. Now for the sinister cripple who
  5527	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlives upon the second floor of the opium den, and who was
  5528	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcertainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St.
  5529	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tClair. His name is Hugh Boone, and his hideous face is one which
  5530	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tis familiar to every man who goes much to the City. He is a
  5531	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tprofessional beggar, though in order to avoid the police
  5532	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tregulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas. Some
  5533	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlittle distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the left-hand
  5534	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tside, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in the
  5535	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat,
  5536	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he
  5537	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tis a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the
  5538	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgreasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him. I
  5539	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave watched the fellow more than once before ever I thought of
  5540	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmaking his professional acquaintance, and I have been surprised
  5541	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tat the harvest which he has reaped in a short time. His
  5542	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tappearance, you see, is so remarkable that no one can pass him
  5543	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twithout observing him. A shock of orange hair, a pale face
  5544	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdisfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has
  5545	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tturned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and a
  5546	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpair of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular
  5547	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcontrast to the colour of his hair, all mark him out from amid
  5548	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe common crowd of mendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he
  5549	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tis ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be
  5550	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthrown at him by the passers-by. This is the man whom we now
  5551	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlearn to have been the lodger at the opium den, and to have been
  5552	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest."
  5553	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5554	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But a cripple!" said I. "What could he have done single-handed
  5555	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tagainst a man in the prime of life?"
  5556	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5557	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in
  5558	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tother respects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man.
  5559	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSurely your medical experience would tell you, Watson, that
  5560	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tweakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional
  5561	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstrength in the others."
  5562	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5563	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Pray continue your narrative."
  5564	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5565	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Mrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the
  5566	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twindow, and she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her
  5567	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpresence could be of no help to them in their investigations.
  5568	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tInspector Barton, who had charge of the case, made a very careful
  5569	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\texamination of the premises, but without finding anything which
  5570	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthrew any light upon the matter. One mistake had been made in not
  5571	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tarresting Boone instantly, as he was allowed some few minutes
  5572	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tduring which he might have communicated with his friend the
  5573	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tLascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he was seized and
  5574	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsearched, without anything being found which could incriminate
  5575	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thim. There were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his right
  5576	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been
  5577	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from
  5578	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthere, adding that he had been to the window not long before, and
  5579	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from
  5580	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe same source. He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr.
  5581	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tNeville St. Clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in
  5582	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this room was as much a mystery to him as to the police. As to
  5583	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tMrs. St. Clair's assertion that she had actually seen her husband
  5584	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tat the window, he declared that she must have been either mad or
  5585	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdreaming. He was removed, loudly protesting, to the
  5586	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpolice-station, while the inspector remained upon the premises in
  5587	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue.
  5588	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5589	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they
  5590	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thad feared to find. It was Neville St. Clair's coat, and not
  5591	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tNeville St. Clair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. And
  5592	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhat do you think they found in the pockets?"
  5593	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5594	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I cannot imagine."
  5595	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5596	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No, I don't think you would guess. Every pocket stuffed with
  5597	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpennies and half-pennies--421 pennies and 270 half-pennies. It
  5598	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide. But a
  5599	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thuman body is a different matter. There is a fierce eddy between
  5600	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe wharf and the house. It seemed likely enough that the
  5601	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tweighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked
  5602	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\taway into the river."
  5603	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5604	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But I understand that all the other clothes were found in the
  5605	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\troom. Would the body be dressed in a coat alone?"
  5606	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5607	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose
  5608	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat this man Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the
  5609	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twindow, there is no human eye which could have seen the deed.
  5610	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWhat would he do then? It would of course instantly strike him
  5611	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat he must get rid of the tell-tale garments. He would seize
  5612	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe coat, then, and be in the act of throwing it out, when it
  5613	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twould occur to him that it would swim and not sink. He has little
  5614	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttime, for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried
  5615	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard from his
  5616	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tLascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street.
  5617	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThere is not an instant to be lost. He rushes to some secret
  5618	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thoard, where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he
  5619	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the
  5620	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpockets to make sure of the coat's sinking. He throws it out, and
  5621	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twould have done the same with the other garments had not he heard
  5622	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe rush of steps below, and only just had time to close the
  5623	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twindow when the police appeared."
  5624	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5625	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It certainly sounds feasible."
  5626	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5627	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a
  5628	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbetter. Boone, as I have told you, was arrested and taken to the
  5629	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstation, but it could not be shown that there had ever before
  5630	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbeen anything against him. He had for years been known as a
  5631	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tprofessional beggar, but his life appeared to have been a very
  5632	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tquiet and innocent one. There the matter stands at present, and
  5633	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe questions which have to be solved--what Neville St. Clair was
  5634	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdoing in the opium den, what happened to him when there, where is
  5635	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\the now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his disappearance--are
  5636	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tall as far from a solution as ever. I confess that I cannot
  5637	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trecall any case within my experience which looked at the first
  5638	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tglance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties."
  5639	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5640	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWhile Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of
  5641	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tevents, we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great
  5642	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttown until the last straggling houses had been left behind, and
  5643	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twe rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us.
  5644	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tJust as he finished, however, we drove through two scattered
  5645	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvillages, where a few lights still glimmered in the windows.
  5646	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5647	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"We are on the outskirts of Lee," said my companion. "We have
  5648	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttouched on three English counties in our short drive, starting in
  5649	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tMiddlesex, passing over an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent.
  5650	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSee that light among the trees? That is The Cedars, and beside
  5651	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already, I have
  5652	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlittle doubt, caught the clink of our horse's feet."
  5653	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5654	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street?" I
  5655	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tasked.
  5656	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5657	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Because there are many inquiries which must be made out here.
  5658	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tMrs. St. Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal, and
  5659	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyou may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for
  5660	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmy friend and colleague. I hate to meet her, Watson, when I have
  5661	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tno news of her husband. Here we are. Whoa, there, whoa!"
  5662	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5663	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWe had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its
  5664	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\town grounds. A stable-boy had run out to the horse's head, and
  5665	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tspringing down, I followed Holmes up the small, winding
  5666	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgravel-drive which led to the house. As we approached, the door
  5667	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tflew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the opening, clad
  5668	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin some sort of light mousseline de soie, with a touch of fluffy
  5669	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpink chiffon at her neck and wrists. She stood with her figure
  5670	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\toutlined against the flood of light, one hand upon the door, one
  5671	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thalf-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly bent, her head
  5672	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a standing
  5673	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tquestion.
  5674	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5675	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well?" she cried, "well?" And then, seeing that there were two
  5676	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof us, she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw
  5677	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.

  5713	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Do not trouble about my feelings. I am not hysterical, nor given
  5714	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto fainting. I simply wish to hear your real, real opinion."
  5715	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5716	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Upon what point?"
  5717	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5718	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"In your heart of hearts, do you think that Neville is alive?"
  5719	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5720	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question.
  5721	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Frankly, now!" she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking
  5722	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tkeenly down at him as he leaned back in a basket-chair.
  5723	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5724	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Frankly, then, madam, I do not."
  5725	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5726	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You think that he is dead?"
  5727	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5728	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I do."
  5729	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5730	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Murdered?"
  5731	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5732	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I don't say that. Perhaps."
  5733	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5734	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And on what day did he meet his death?"
  5735	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5736	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"On Monday."
  5737	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5738	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Then perhaps, Mr. Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how
  5739	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit is that I have received a letter from him to-day."
  5740	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5741	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been
  5742	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgalvanised.
  5743	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5744	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What!" he roared.
  5745	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5746	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, to-day." She stood smiling, holding up a little slip of
  5747	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpaper in the air.
  5748	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5749	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"May I see it?"
  5750	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5751	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Certainly."
  5752	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5753	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHe snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out
  5754	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tupon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently. I
  5755	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thad left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder. The
  5756	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tenvelope was a very coarse one and was stamped with the Gravesend
  5757	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpostmark and with the date of that very day, or rather of the day
  5758	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbefore, for it was considerably after midnight.
  5759	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5760	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Coarse writing," murmured Holmes. "Surely this is not your
  5761	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thusband's writing, madam."
  5762	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5763	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No, but the enclosure is."
  5764	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5765	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go
  5766	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand inquire as to the address."
  5767	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5768	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"How can you tell that?"
  5769	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5770	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried
  5771	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\titself. The rest is of the greyish colour, which shows that
  5772	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tblotting-paper has been used. If it had been written straight
  5773	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\toff, and then blotted, none would be of a deep black shade. This
  5774	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tman has written the name, and there has then been a pause before

  5776	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfamiliar with it. It is, of course, a trifle, but there is
  5777	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnothing so important as trifles. Let us now see the letter. Ha!

  5787	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5788	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"His hand when he wrote hurriedly. It is very unlike his usual

  5895	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5896	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tA large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our
  5897	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdisposal, and I was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary
  5898	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tafter my night of adventure. Sherlock Holmes was a man, however,
  5899	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twho, when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for
  5900	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdays, and even for a week, without rest, turning it over,
  5901	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trearranging his facts, looking at it from every point of view
  5902	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tuntil he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his
  5903	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdata were insufficient. It was soon evident to me that he was now
  5904	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpreparing for an all-night sitting. He took off his coat and
  5905	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twaistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then wandered
  5906	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tabout the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from
  5907	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe sofa and armchairs. With these he constructed a sort of
  5908	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tEastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with
  5909	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tan ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front
  5910	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof him. In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an
  5911	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\told briar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the
  5912	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcorner of the ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him,
  5913	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsilent, motionless, with the light shining upon his strong-set
  5914	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\taquiline features. So he sat as I dropped off to sleep, and so he
  5915	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up, and I found
  5916	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe summer sun shining into the apartment. The pipe was still
  5917	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbetween his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the room was
  5918	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfull of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap of
  5919	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshag which I had seen upon the previous night.
  5920	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5921	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Awake, Watson?" he asked.
  5922	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5923	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes."
  5924	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5925	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Game for a morning drive?"
  5926	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5927	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Certainly."
  5928	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5929	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Then dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know where the
  5930	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstable-boy sleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out." He
  5931	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tchuckled to himself as he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed
  5932	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night.
  5933	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5934	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tAs I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one
  5935	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas stirring. It was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly
  5936	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfinished when Holmes returned with the news that the boy was
  5937	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tputting in the horse.
  5938	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5939	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I want to test a little theory of mine," said he, pulling on his
  5940	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tboots. "I think, Watson, that you are now standing in the
  5941	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpresence of one of the most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve
  5942	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto be kicked from here to Charing Cross. But I think I have the
  5943	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tkey of the affair now."
  5944	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5945	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And where is it?" I asked, smiling.
  5946	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5947	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"In the bathroom," he answered. "Oh, yes, I am not joking," he
  5948	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcontinued, seeing my look of incredulity. "I have just been
  5949	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthere, and I have taken it out, and I have got it in this
  5950	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tGladstone bag. Come on, my boy, and we shall see whether it will
  5951	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnot fit the lock."
  5952	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5953	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWe made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into
  5954	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe bright morning sunshine. In the road stood our horse and
  5955	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttrap, with the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. We both
  5956	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsprang in, and away we dashed down the London Road. A few country
  5957	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcarts were stirring, bearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but
  5958	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as
  5959	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsome city in a dream.
  5960	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5961	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It has been in some points a singular case," said Holmes,
  5962	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tflicking the horse on into a gallop. "I confess that I have been
  5963	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tas blind as a mole, but it is better to learn wisdom late than
  5964	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnever to learn it at all."
  5965	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5966	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tIn town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily
  5967	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfrom their windows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey
  5968	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tside. Passing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the
  5969	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\triver, and dashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the
  5970	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tright and found ourselves in Bow Street. Sherlock Holmes was well
  5971	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tknown to the force, and the two constables at the door saluted
  5972	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thim. One of them held the horse's head while the other led us in.
  5973	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5974	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Who is on duty?" asked Holmes.
  5975	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5976	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Inspector Bradstreet, sir."
  5977	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5978	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Ah, Bradstreet, how are you?" A tall, stout official had come
  5979	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdown the stone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged
  5980	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tjacket. "I wish to have a quiet word with you, Bradstreet."
  5981	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Certainly, Mr. Holmes. Step into my room here." It was a small,
  5982	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\toffice-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table, and a
  5983	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttelephone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat down at his
  5984	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdesk.
  5985	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5986	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?"
  5987	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5988	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I called about that beggarman, Boone--the one who was charged
  5989	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twith being concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St.
  5990	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tClair, of Lee."
  5991	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5992	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries."
  5993	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5994	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"So I heard. You have him here?"
  5995	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5996	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"In the cells."
  5997	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  5998	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Is he quiet?"
  5999	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6000	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Oh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel."
  6001	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6002	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Dirty?"
  6003	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6004	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his
  6005	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tface is as black as a tinker's. Well, when once his case has been
  6006	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsettled, he will have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you
  6007	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsaw him, you would agree with me that he needed it."
  6008	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6009	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I should like to see him very much."
  6010	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6011	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Would you? That is easily done. Come this way. You can leave
  6012	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyour bag."
  6013	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6014	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No, I think that I'll take it."
  6015	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6016	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Very good. Come this way, if you please." He led us down a
  6017	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpassage, opened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and
  6018	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbrought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each
  6019	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tside.
  6020	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6021	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The third on the right is his," said the inspector. "Here it
  6022	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tis!" He quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door
  6023	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand glanced through.
  6024	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6025	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"He is asleep," said he. "You can see him very well."
  6026	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6027	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWe both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his
  6028	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tface towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and
  6029	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\theavily. He was a middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his
  6030	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcalling, with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his
  6031	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttattered coat. He was, as the inspector had said, extremely
  6032	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdirty, but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its
  6033	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trepulsive ugliness. A broad wheal from an old scar ran right
  6034	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tacross it from eye to chin, and by its contraction had turned up
  6035	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tone side of the upper lip, so that three teeth were exposed in a
  6036	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tperpetual snarl. A shock of very bright red hair grew low over
  6037	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this eyes and forehead.
  6038	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6039	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"He's a beauty, isn't he?" said the inspector.
  6040	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6041	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"He certainly needs a wash," remarked Holmes. "I had an idea that
  6042	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\the might, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me."
  6043	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHe opened the Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my
  6044	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tastonishment, a very large bath-sponge.
  6045	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6046	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"He! he! You are a funny one," chuckled the inspector.
  6047	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6048	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very
  6049	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tquietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable
  6050	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfigure."
  6051	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6052	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, I don't know why not," said the inspector. "He doesn't
  6053	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlook a credit to the Bow Street cells, does he?" He slipped his
  6054	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tkey into the lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. The
  6055	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsleeper half turned, and then settled down once more into a deep
  6056	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tslumber. Holmes stooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge,
  6057	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the
  6058	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tprisoner's face.
  6059	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6060	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Let me introduce you," he shouted, "to Mr. Neville St. Clair, of
  6061	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tLee, in the county of Kent."
  6062	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6063	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tNever in my life have I seen such a sight. The man's face peeled
  6064	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\toff under the sponge like the bark from a tree. Gone was the
  6065	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcoarse brown tint! Gone, too, was the horrid scar which had
  6066	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tseamed it across, and the twisted lip which had given the
  6067	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trepulsive sneer to the face! A twitch brought away the tangled
  6068	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tred hair, and there, sitting up in his bed, was a pale,
  6069	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and smooth-skinned,
  6070	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment.
  6071	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThen suddenly realising the exposure, he broke into a scream and
  6072	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthrew himself down with his face to the pillow.
  6073	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6074	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Great heavens!" cried the inspector, "it is, indeed, the missing
  6075	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tman. I know him from the photograph."
  6076	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6077	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons
  6078	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thimself to his destiny. "Be it so," said he. "And pray what am I
  6079	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcharged with?"
  6080	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6081	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"With making away with Mr. Neville St.-- Oh, come, you can't be
  6082	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcharged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of
  6083	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit," said the inspector with a grin. "Well, I have been
  6084	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttwenty-seven years in the force, but this really takes the cake."
  6085	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6086	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"If I am Mr. Neville St. Clair, then it is obvious that no crime
  6087	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thas been committed, and that, therefore, I am illegally
  6088	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdetained."
  6089	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6090	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No crime, but a very great error has been committed," said
  6091	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHolmes. "You would have done better to have trusted your wife."
  6092	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6093	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It was not the wife; it was the children," groaned the prisoner.
  6094	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"God help me, I would not have them ashamed of their father. My
  6095	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tGod! What an exposure! What can I do?"
  6096	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6097	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him
  6098	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tkindly on the shoulder.
  6099	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6100	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"If you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up," said
  6101	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\the, "of course you can hardly avoid publicity. On the other hand,
  6102	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tif you convince the police authorities that there is no possible
  6103	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcase against you, I do not know that there is any reason that the
  6104	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdetails should find their way into the papers. Inspector
  6105	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tBradstreet would, I am sure, make notes upon anything which you
  6106	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmight tell us and submit it to the proper authorities. The case
  6107	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twould then never go into court at all."
  6108	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6109	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"God bless you!" cried the prisoner passionately. "I would have
  6110	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tendured imprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left
  6111	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmy miserable secret as a family blot to my children.
  6112	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6113	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You are the first who have ever heard my story. My father was a
  6114	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tschoolmaster in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent
  6115	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\teducation. I travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and
  6116	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfinally became a reporter on an evening paper in London. One day
  6117	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmy editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the
  6118	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmetropolis, and I volunteered to supply them. There was the point
  6119	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfrom which all my adventures started. It was only by trying
  6120	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbegging as an amateur that I could get the facts upon which to
  6121	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbase my articles. When an actor I had, of course, learned all the
  6122	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsecrets of making up, and had been famous in the green-room for
  6123	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmy skill. I took advantage now of my attainments. I painted my
  6124	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tface, and to make myself as pitiable as possible I made a good
  6125	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tscar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a
  6126	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsmall slip of flesh-coloured plaster. Then with a red head of
  6127	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business
  6128	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpart of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a
  6129	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbeggar. For seven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned
  6130	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thome in the evening I found to my surprise that I had received no
  6131	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tless than 26s. 4d.
  6132	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6133	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until,
  6134	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsome time later, I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ
  6135	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tserved upon me for 25 pounds. I was at my wit's end where to get
  6136	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe money, but a sudden idea came to me. I begged a fortnight's
  6137	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgrace from the creditor, asked for a holiday from my employers,
  6138	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand spent the time in begging in the City under my disguise. In
  6139	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tten days I had the money and had paid the debt.
  6140	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6141	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous
  6142	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twork at 2 pounds a week when I knew that I could earn as much in
  6143	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta day by smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on
  6144	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe ground, and sitting still. It was a long fight between my
  6145	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpride and the money, but the dollars won at last, and I threw up
  6146	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\treporting and sat day after day in the corner which I had first
  6147	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tchosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets
  6148	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twith coppers. Only one man knew my secret. He was the keeper of a
  6149	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlow den in which I used to lodge in Swandam Lane, where I could
  6150	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tevery morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings
  6151	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttransform myself into a well-dressed man about town. This fellow,
  6152	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that I knew that
  6153	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmy secret was safe in his possession.
  6154	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6155	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of
  6156	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmoney. I do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London
  6157	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcould earn 700 pounds a year--which is less than my average
  6158	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttakings--but I had exceptional advantages in my power of making
  6159	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tup, and also in a facility of repartee, which improved by
  6160	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpractice and made me quite a recognised character in the City.
  6161	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tAll day a stream of pennies, varied by silver, poured in upon me,
  6162	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand it was a very bad day in which I failed to take 2 pounds.
  6163	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6164	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"As I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the
  6165	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcountry, and eventually married, without anyone having a
  6166	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsuspicion as to my real occupation. My dear wife knew that I had
  6167	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbusiness in the City. She little knew what.
  6168	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6169	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Last Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in my
  6170	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\troom above the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw,
  6171	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto my horror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the
  6172	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstreet, with her eyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of
  6173	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsurprise, threw up my arms to cover my face, and, rushing to my
  6174	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tconfidant, the Lascar, entreated him to prevent anyone from
  6175	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcoming up to me. I heard her voice downstairs, but I knew that
  6176	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshe could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off my clothes, pulled on
  6177	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthose of a beggar, and put on my pigments and wig. Even a wife's
  6178	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\teyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. But then it
  6179	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\toccurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and that
  6180	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe clothes might betray me. I threw open the window, reopening
  6181	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tby my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in
  6182	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe bedroom that morning. Then I seized my coat, which was
  6183	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tweighted by the coppers which I had just transferred to it from
  6184	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe leather bag in which I carried my takings. I hurled it out of
  6185	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe window, and it disappeared into the Thames. The other clothes
  6186	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twould have followed, but at that moment there was a rush of
  6187	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tconstables up the stair, and a few minutes after I found, rather,
  6188	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI confess, to my relief, that instead of being identified as Mr.
  6189	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tNeville St. Clair, I was arrested as his murderer.
  6190	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6191	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. I
  6192	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and
  6193	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thence my preference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would
  6194	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbe terribly anxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the
  6195	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tLascar at a moment when no constable was watching me, together
  6196	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twith a hurried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to
  6197	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfear."
  6198	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6199	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"That note only reached her yesterday," said Holmes.
  6200	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t

  6203	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The police have watched this Lascar," said Inspector Bradstreet,
  6204	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"and I can quite understand that he might find it difficult to
  6205	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpost a letter unobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor
  6206	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcustomer of his, who forgot all about it for some days."
  6207	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6208	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"That was it," said Holmes, nodding approvingly; "I have no doubt
  6209	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof it. But have you never been prosecuted for begging?"
  6210	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6211	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Many times; but what was a fine to me?"
  6212	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6213	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It must stop here, however," said Bradstreet. "If the police are
  6214	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto hush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone."
  6215	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6216	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take."
  6217	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6218	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"In that case I think that it is probable that no further steps
  6219	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmay be taken. But if you are found again, then all must come out.
  6220	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI am sure, Mr. Holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for
  6221	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thaving cleared the matter up. I wish I knew how you reach your
  6222	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tresults."
  6223	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6224	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I reached this one," said my friend, "by sitting upon five
  6225	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpillows and consuming an ounce of shag. I think, Watson, that if
  6226	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twe drive to Baker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast."

  6229	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6230	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tVII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE
  6231	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6232	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second
  6233	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmorning after Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the
  6234	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcompliments of the season. He was lounging upon the sofa in a
  6235	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpurple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon the
  6236	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tright, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, evidently newly
  6237	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstudied, near at hand. Beside the couch was a wooden chair, and
  6238	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ton the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable
  6239	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several
  6240	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tplaces. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair
  6241	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsuggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the
  6242	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpurpose of examination.
  6243	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6244	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You are engaged," said I; "perhaps I interrupt you."
  6245	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6246	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Not at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss
  6247	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmy results. The matter is a perfectly trivial one"--he jerked his
  6248	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthumb in the direction of the old hat--"but there are points in
  6249	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tconnection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and
  6250	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\teven of instruction."
  6251	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6252	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his
  6253	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcrackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows
  6254	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twere thick with the ice crystals. "I suppose," I remarked, "that,
  6255	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thomely as it looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to
  6256	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit--that it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of
  6257	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsome mystery and the punishment of some crime."
  6258	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6259	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No, no. No crime," said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. "Only one of
  6260	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthose whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have
  6261	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfour million human beings all jostling each other within the
  6262	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tspace of a few square miles. Amid the action and reaction of so
  6263	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdense a swarm of humanity, every possible combination of events
  6264	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmay be expected to take place, and many a little problem will be
  6265	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpresented which may be striking and bizarre without being
  6266	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcriminal. We have already had experience of such."
  6267	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6268	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"So much so," I remarked, "that of the last six cases which I
  6269	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave added to my notes, three have been entirely free of any
  6270	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlegal crime."
  6271	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6272	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Precisely. You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler
  6273	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpapers, to the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the
  6274	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tadventure of the man with the twisted lip. Well, I have no doubt
  6275	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat this small matter will fall into the same innocent category.
  6276	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tYou know Peterson, the commissionaire?"
  6277	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6278	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes."
  6279	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6280	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It is to him that this trophy belongs."
  6281	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6282	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It is his hat."
  6283	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6284	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No, no, he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you will
  6285	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlook upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual
  6286	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tproblem. And, first, as to how it came here. It arrived upon
  6287	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tChristmas morning, in company with a good fat goose, which is, I
  6288	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave no doubt, roasting at this moment in front of Peterson's
  6289	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfire. The facts are these: about four o'clock on Christmas
  6290	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmorning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a very honest fellow, was
  6291	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\treturning from some small jollification and was making his way
  6292	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thomeward down Tottenham Court Road. In front of him he saw, in
  6293	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and
  6294	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcarrying a white goose slung over his shoulder. As he reached the
  6295	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcorner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between this stranger
  6296	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand a little knot of roughs. One of the latter knocked off the
  6297	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tman's hat, on which he raised his stick to defend himself and,
  6298	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tswinging it over his head, smashed the shop window behind him.
  6299	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tPeterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his
  6300	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tassailants; but the man, shocked at having broken the window, and
  6301	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tseeing an official-looking person in uniform rushing towards him,
  6302	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdropped his goose, took to his heels, and vanished amid the
  6303	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlabyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of Tottenham
  6304	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tCourt Road. The roughs had also fled at the appearance of
  6305	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tPeterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of
  6306	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbattle, and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this
  6307	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbattered hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose."
  6308	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6309	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Which surely he restored to their owner?"
  6310	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6311	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"My dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is true that 'For
  6312	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tMrs. Henry Baker' was printed upon a small card which was tied to
  6313	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe bird's left leg, and it is also true that the initials 'H.
  6314	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tB.' are legible upon the lining of this hat, but as there are
  6315	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsome thousands of Bakers, and some hundreds of Henry Bakers in
  6316	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthis city of ours, it is not easy to restore lost property to any
  6317	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tone of them."
  6318	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6319	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What, then, did Peterson do?"
  6320	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6321	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning,
  6322	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tknowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me.
  6323	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe goose we retained until this morning, when there were signs
  6324	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat, in spite of the slight frost, it would be well that it
  6325	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshould be eaten without unnecessary delay. Its finder has carried
  6326	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit off, therefore, to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose,
  6327	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhile I continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who
  6328	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlost his Christmas dinner."
  6329	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6330	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Did he not advertise?"
  6331	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6332	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No."
  6333	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6334	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Then, what clue could you have as to his identity?"
  6335	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6336	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Only as much as we can deduce."
  6337	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6338	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"From his hat?"
  6339	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6340	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Precisely."
  6341	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6342	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But you are joking. What can you gather from this old battered
  6343	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfelt?"
  6344	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6345	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Here is my lens. You know my methods. What can you gather
  6346	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this
  6347	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tarticle?"
  6348	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6349	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather
  6350	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\truefully. It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round
  6351	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshape, hard and much the worse for wear. The lining had been of
  6352	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tred silk, but was a good deal discoloured. There was no maker's
  6353	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tname; but, as Holmes had remarked, the initials "H. B." were
  6354	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tscrawled upon one side. It was pierced in the brim for a
  6355	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\that-securer, but the elastic was missing. For the rest, it was
  6356	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places,
  6357	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\talthough there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the
  6358	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdiscoloured patches by smearing them with ink.
  6359	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6360	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I can see nothing," said I, handing it back to my friend.
  6361	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6362	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail,
  6363	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thowever, to reason from what you see. You are too timid in
  6364	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdrawing your inferences."
  6365	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6366	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?"
  6367	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6368	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHe picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective
  6369	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfashion which was characteristic of him. "It is perhaps less
  6370	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsuggestive than it might have been," he remarked, "and yet there
  6371	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tare a few inferences which are very distinct, and a few others
  6372	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich represent at least a strong balance of probability. That
  6373	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the
  6374	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tface of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the
  6375	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlast three years, although he has now fallen upon evil days. He
  6376	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thad foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing to a
  6377	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmoral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his
  6378	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink,
  6379	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tat work upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that
  6380	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this wife has ceased to love him."
  6381	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6382	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"My dear Holmes!"
  6383	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6384	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect," he
  6385	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcontinued, disregarding my remonstrance. "He is a man who leads a
  6386	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsedentary life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is
  6387	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmiddle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the
  6388	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlast few days, and which he anoints with lime-cream. These are
  6389	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat. Also,
  6390	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tby the way, that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid
  6391	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ton in his house."
  6392	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6393	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You are certainly joking, Holmes."
  6394	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6395	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Not in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you
  6396	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthese results, you are unable to see how they are attained?"
  6397	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6398	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I
  6399	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tam unable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that
  6400	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthis man was intellectual?"
  6401	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6402	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tFor answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right
  6403	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tover the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. "It is
  6404	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta question of cubic capacity," said he; "a man with so large a
  6405	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbrain must have something in it."
  6406	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6407	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The decline of his fortunes, then?"
  6408	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6409	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"This hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge
  6410	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcame in then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the
  6411	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tband of ribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could
  6412	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tafford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no
  6413	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\that since, then he has assuredly gone down in the world."
  6414	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6415	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the
  6416	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tforesight and the moral retrogression?"
  6417	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6418	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSherlock Holmes laughed. "Here is the foresight," said he putting
  6419	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer.
  6420	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"They are never sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a
  6421	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsign of a certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his
  6422	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tway to take this precaution against the wind. But since we see
  6423	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace
  6424	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly,
  6425	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich is a distinct proof of a weakening nature. On the other
  6426	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thand, he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the
  6427	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfelt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign that he has not
  6428	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tentirely lost his self-respect."
  6429	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6430	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Your reasoning is certainly plausible."
  6431	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6432	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is
  6433	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgrizzled, that it has been recently cut, and that he uses
  6434	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlime-cream, are all to be gathered from a close examination of the
  6435	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlower part of the lining. The lens discloses a large number of
  6436	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber. They all
  6437	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tappear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of
  6438	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlime-cream. This dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, grey
  6439	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house,

  6441	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the
  6442	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twearer perspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in
  6443	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe best of training."
  6444	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6445	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But his wife--you said that she had ceased to love him."
  6446	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6447	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"This hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear
  6448	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWatson, with a week's accumulation of dust upon your hat, and
  6449	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhen your wife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear
  6450	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife's
  6451	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\taffection."
  6452	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6453	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But he might be a bachelor."
  6454	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6455	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his
  6456	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twife. Remember the card upon the bird's leg."
  6457	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6458	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You have an answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce
  6459	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat the gas is not laid on in his house?"
  6460	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6461	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I
  6462	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsee no less than five, I think that there can be little doubt
  6463	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat the individual must be brought into frequent contact with
  6464	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tburning tallow--walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in
  6465	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tone hand and a guttering candle in the other. Anyhow, he never
  6466	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgot tallow-stains from a gas-jet. Are you satisfied?"
  6467	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6468	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, it is very ingenious," said I, laughing; "but since, as
  6469	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyou said just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm
  6470	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdone save the loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a
  6471	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twaste of energy."
  6472	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6473	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew
  6474	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\topen, and Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment
  6475	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twith flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with
  6476	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tastonishment.
  6477	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6478	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The goose, Mr. Holmes! The goose, sir!" he gasped.
  6479	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6480	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Eh? What of it, then? Has it returned to life and flapped off
  6481	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthrough the kitchen window?" Holmes twisted himself round upon
  6482	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe sofa to get a fairer view of the man's excited face.
  6483	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6484	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"See here, sir! See what my wife found in its crop!" He held out
  6485	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly
  6486	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tscintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but
  6487	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric
  6488	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpoint in the dark hollow of his hand.
  6489	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6490	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle. "By Jove, Peterson!" said
  6491	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\the, "this is treasure trove indeed. I suppose you know what you
  6492	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave got?"
  6493	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6494	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"A diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass as though
  6495	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit were putty."
  6496	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6497	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It's more than a precious stone. It is the precious stone."
  6498	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6499	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Not the Countess of Morcar's blue carbuncle!" I ejaculated.
  6500	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6501	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Precisely so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I
  6502	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave read the advertisement about it in The Times every day
  6503	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlately. It is absolutely unique, and its value can only be
  6504	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tconjectured, but the reward offered of 1000 pounds is certainly
  6505	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnot within a twentieth part of the market price."
  6506	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6507	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"A thousand pounds! Great Lord of mercy!" The commissionaire
  6508	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tplumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us.
  6509	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6510	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"That is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are
  6511	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsentimental considerations in the background which would induce
  6512	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe Countess to part with half her fortune if she could but
  6513	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trecover the gem."
  6514	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6515	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel Cosmopolitan," I

  6517	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6518	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Precisely so, on December 22nd, just five days ago. John Horner,
  6519	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta plumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady's
  6520	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tjewel-case. The evidence against him was so strong that the case
  6521	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thas been referred to the Assizes. I have some account of the
  6522	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmatter here, I believe." He rummaged amid his newspapers,
  6523	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tglancing over the dates, until at last he smoothed one out,
  6524	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdoubled it over, and read the following paragraph:
  6525	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6526	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, 26, plumber, was
  6527	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbrought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst.,
  6528	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tabstracted from the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the
  6529	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvaluable gem known as the blue carbuncle. James Ryder,
  6530	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tupper-attendant at the hotel, gave his evidence to the effect
  6531	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room of the Countess
  6532	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might
  6533	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsolder the second bar of the grate, which was loose. He had
  6534	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tremained with Horner some little time, but had finally been
  6535	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcalled away. On returning, he found that Horner had disappeared,
  6536	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat the bureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco
  6537	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcasket in which, as it afterwards transpired, the Countess was
  6538	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\taccustomed to keep her jewel, was lying empty upon the
  6539	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdressing-table. Ryder instantly gave the alarm, and Horner was
  6540	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tarrested the same evening; but the stone could not be found
  6541	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\teither upon his person or in his rooms. Catherine Cusack, maid to
  6542	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe Countess, deposed to having heard Ryder's cry of dismay on
  6543	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdiscovering the robbery, and to having rushed into the room,
  6544	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhere she found matters as described by the last witness.
  6545	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tInspector Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest
  6546	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof Horner, who struggled frantically, and protested his innocence
  6547	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin the strongest terms. Evidence of a previous conviction for
  6548	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trobbery having been given against the prisoner, the magistrate
  6549	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trefused to deal summarily with the offence, but referred it to
  6550	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe Assizes. Horner, who had shown signs of intense emotion
  6551	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tduring the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion and was
  6552	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcarried out of court."
  6553	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6554	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Hum! So much for the police-court," said Holmes thoughtfully,
  6555	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttossing aside the paper. "The question for us now to solve is the
  6556	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsequence of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to
  6557	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe crop of a goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other. You
  6558	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsee, Watson, our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much
  6559	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmore important and less innocent aspect. Here is the stone; the
  6560	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstone came from the goose, and the goose came from Mr. Henry
  6561	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tBaker, the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other
  6562	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcharacteristics with which I have bored you. So now we must set
  6563	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and
  6564	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery. To
  6565	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdo this, we must try the simplest means first, and these lie
  6566	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tundoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers. If
  6567	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthis fail, I shall have recourse to other methods."
  6568	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6569	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What will you say?"
  6570	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6571	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Give me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now, then: 'Found at
  6572	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe corner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr.
  6573	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHenry Baker can have the same by applying at 6:30 this evening at
  6574	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t221B, Baker Street.' That is clear and concise."
  6575	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6576	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Very. But will he see it?"
  6577	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6578	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor
  6579	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tman, the loss was a heavy one. He was clearly so scared by his
  6580	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmischance in breaking the window and by the approach of Peterson
  6581	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat he thought of nothing but flight, but since then he must
  6582	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his
  6583	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbird. Then, again, the introduction of his name will cause him to
  6584	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsee it, for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to
  6585	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit. Here you are, Peterson, run down to the advertising agency
  6586	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand have this put in the evening papers."
  6587	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6588	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"In which, sir?"
  6589	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6590	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Oh, in the Globe, Star, Pall Mall, St. James's, Evening News,
  6591	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tStandard, Echo, and any others that occur to you."
  6592	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6593	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Very well, sir. And this stone?"
  6594	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6595	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say,
  6596	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tPeterson, just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here
  6597	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twith me, for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place
  6598	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof the one which your family is now devouring."
  6599	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6600	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWhen the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and
  6601	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\theld it against the light. "It's a bonny thing," said he. "Just
  6602	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsee how it glints and sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and
  6603	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfocus of crime. Every good stone is. They are the devil's pet
  6604	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbaits. In the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a
  6605	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbloody deed. This stone is not yet twenty years old. It was found
  6606	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin the banks of the Amoy River in southern China and is remarkable
  6607	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin having every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is
  6608	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tblue in shade instead of ruby red. In spite of its youth, it has
  6609	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\talready a sinister history. There have been two murders, a
  6610	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought about
  6611	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfor the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal.
  6612	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWho would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the
  6613	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgallows and the prison? I'll lock it up in my strong box now and
  6614	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdrop a line to the Countess to say that we have it."
  6615	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6616	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Do you think that this man Horner is innocent?"
  6617	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6618	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I cannot tell."
  6619	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6620	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, had
  6621	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tanything to do with the matter?"
  6622	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6623	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an
  6624	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tabsolutely innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he
  6625	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made
  6626	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof solid gold. That, however, I shall determine by a very simple
  6627	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttest if we have an answer to our advertisement."
  6628	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6629	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And you can do nothing until then?"
  6630	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6631	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Nothing."
  6632	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6633	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"In that case I shall continue my professional round. But I shall
  6634	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcome back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for I
  6635	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshould like to see the solution of so tangled a business."
  6636	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6637	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Very glad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a woodcock, I
  6638	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbelieve. By the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I
  6639	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tought to ask Mrs. Hudson to examine its crop."
  6640	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6641	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past
  6642	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsix when I found myself in Baker Street once more. As I
  6643	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tapproached the house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a
  6644	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcoat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the
  6645	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight. Just as I
  6646	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tarrived the door was opened, and we were shown up together to
  6647	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHolmes' room.
  6648	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6649	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Mr. Henry Baker, I believe," said he, rising from his armchair
  6650	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he
  6651	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcould so readily assume. "Pray take this chair by the fire, Mr.
  6652	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tBaker. It is a cold night, and I observe that your circulation is
  6653	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmore adapted for summer than for winter. Ah, Watson, you have
  6654	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tjust come at the right time. Is that your hat, Mr. Baker?"
  6655	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6656	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat."
  6657	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6658	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHe was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a
  6659	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbroad, intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of
  6660	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgrizzled brown. A touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight
  6661	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttremor of his extended hand, recalled Holmes' surmise as to his
  6662	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thabits. His rusty black frock-coat was buttoned right up in
  6663	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfront, with the collar turned up, and his lank wrists protruded
  6664	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfrom his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt. He spoke in a
  6665	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tslow staccato fashion, choosing his words with care, and gave the
  6666	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\timpression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had
  6667	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\till-usage at the hands of fortune.
  6668	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6669	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"We have retained these things for some days," said Holmes,
  6670	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your
  6671	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\taddress. I am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise."
  6672	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6673	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tOur visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. "Shillings have not
  6674	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbeen so plentiful with me as they once were," he remarked. "I had

  6676	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tboth my hat and the bird. I did not care to spend more money in a
  6677	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thopeless attempt at recovering them."
  6678	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6679	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Very naturally. By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to
  6680	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\teat it."
  6681	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6682	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"To eat it!" Our visitor half rose from his chair in his
  6683	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\texcitement.
  6684	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6685	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so.
  6686	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tBut I presume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is
  6687	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tabout the same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your
  6688	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpurpose equally well?"
  6689	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6690	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Oh, certainly, certainly," answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of
  6691	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trelief.
  6692	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6693	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of
  6694	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyour own bird, so if you wish--"
  6695	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6696	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe man burst into a hearty laugh. "They might be useful to me as
  6697	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trelics of my adventure," said he, "but beyond that I can hardly
  6698	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsee what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are
  6699	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgoing to be to me. No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I
  6700	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twill confine my attentions to the excellent bird which I perceive
  6701	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tupon the sideboard."
  6702	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6703	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug
  6704	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof his shoulders.
  6705	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6706	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"There is your hat, then, and there your bird," said he. "By the
  6707	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tway, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one
  6708	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfrom? I am somewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a
  6709	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbetter grown goose."
  6710	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6711	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Certainly, sir," said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly
  6712	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgained property under his arm. "There are a few of us who
  6713	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfrequent the Alpha Inn, near the Museum--we are to be found in
  6714	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe Museum itself during the day, you understand. This year our
  6715	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgood host, Windigate by name, instituted a goose club, by which,
  6716	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ton consideration of some few pence every week, we were each to
  6717	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\treceive a bird at Christmas. My pence were duly paid, and the
  6718	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trest is familiar to you. I am much indebted to you, sir, for a
  6719	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tScotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity." With
  6720	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and
  6721	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstrode off upon his way.
  6722	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6723	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"So much for Mr. Henry Baker," said Holmes when he had closed the
  6724	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdoor behind him. "It is quite certain that he knows nothing
  6725	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhatever about the matter. Are you hungry, Watson?"
  6726	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6727	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Not particularly."
  6728	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6729	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Then I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow
  6730	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tup this clue while it is still hot."
  6731	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6732	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"By all means."
  6733	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6734	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tIt was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped
  6735	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcravats about our throats. Outside, the stars were shining coldly
  6736	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin a cloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out
  6737	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinto smoke like so many pistol shots. Our footfalls rang out
  6738	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcrisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors' quarter,
  6739	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWimpole Street, Harley Street, and so through Wigmore Street into
  6740	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tOxford Street. In a quarter of an hour we were in Bloomsbury at
  6741	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe Alpha Inn, which is a small public-house at the corner of one
  6742	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof the streets which runs down into Holborn. Holmes pushed open
  6743	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from
  6744	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.
  6745	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6746	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese,"
  6747	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsaid he.
  6748	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6749	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"My geese!" The man seemed surprised.
  6750	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6751	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes. I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker,
  6752	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twho was a member of your goose club."
  6753	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6754	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Ah! yes, I see. But you see, sir, them's not our geese."
  6755	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6756	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Indeed! Whose, then?"
  6757	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6758	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden."
  6759	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6760	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Indeed? I know some of them. Which was it?"
  6761	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6762	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Breckinridge is his name."
  6763	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6764	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Ah! I don't know him. Well, here's your good health landlord,
  6765	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand prosperity to your house. Good-night."
  6766	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6767	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Now for Mr. Breckinridge," he continued, buttoning up his coat
  6768	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tas we came out into the frosty air. "Remember, Watson that though
  6769	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twe have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we
  6770	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave at the other a man who will certainly get seven years' penal
  6771	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tservitude unless we can establish his innocence. It is possible
  6772	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat our inquiry may but confirm his guilt; but, in any case, we
  6773	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave a line of investigation which has been missed by the police,
  6774	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand which a singular chance has placed in our hands. Let us
  6775	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfollow it out to the bitter end. Faces to the south, then, and
  6776	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tquick march!"
  6777	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6778	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWe passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a
  6779	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tzigzag of slums to Covent Garden Market. One of the largest
  6780	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstalls bore the name of Breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor
  6781	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta horsey-looking man, with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was
  6782	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thelping a boy to put up the shutters.
  6783	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6784	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Good-evening. It's a cold night," said Holmes.
  6785	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6786	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my
  6787	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcompanion.
  6788	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6789	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Sold out of geese, I see," continued Holmes, pointing at the
  6790	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbare slabs of marble.
  6791	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6792	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Let you have five hundred to-morrow morning."
  6793	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6794	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"That's no good."
  6795	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6796	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare."
  6797	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6798	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Ah, but I was recommended to you."
  6799	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6800	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Who by?"
  6801	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6802	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The landlord of the Alpha."
  6803	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6804	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Oh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen."
  6805	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6806	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Fine birds they were, too. Now where did you get them from?"
  6807	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6808	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tTo my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the
  6809	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsalesman.
  6810	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6811	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Now, then, mister," said he, with his head cocked and his arms
  6812	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\takimbo, "what are you driving at? Let's have it straight, now."
  6813	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6814	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It is straight enough. I should like to know who sold you the
  6815	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgeese which you supplied to the Alpha."
  6816	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6817	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well then, I shan't tell you. So now!"
  6818	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6819	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Oh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don't know why you
  6820	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshould be so warm over such a trifle."
  6821	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6822	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Warm! You'd be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am.
  6823	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWhen I pay good money for a good article there should be an end
  6824	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof the business; but it's 'Where are the geese?' and 'Who did you
  6825	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsell the geese to?' and 'What will you take for the geese?' One
  6826	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twould think they were the only geese in the world, to hear the
  6827	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfuss that is made over them."
  6828	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6829	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, I have no connection with any other people who have been
  6830	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmaking inquiries," said Holmes carelessly. "If you won't tell us
  6831	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe bet is off, that is all. But I'm always ready to back my
  6832	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\topinion on a matter of fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the
  6833	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbird I ate is country bred."
  6834	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6835	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, then, you've lost your fiver, for it's town bred," snapped
  6836	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe salesman.
  6837	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6838	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It's nothing of the kind."
  6839	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6840	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I say it is."
  6841	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6842	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I don't believe it."
  6843	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6844	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"D'you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled

  6846	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twent to the Alpha were town bred."
  6847	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6848	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You'll never persuade me to believe that."
  6849	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6850	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Will you bet, then?"
  6851	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6852	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It's merely taking your money, for I know that I am right. But
  6853	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI'll have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be

  6855	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6856	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe salesman chuckled grimly. "Bring me the books, Bill," said

  6858	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6859	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great
  6860	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgreasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging
  6861	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlamp.
  6862	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6863	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Now then, Mr. Cocksure," said the salesman, "I thought that I

  6878	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Quite so. Now turn that up in the ledger."

  6883	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Now, then, what's the last entry?"
  6884	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6885	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'December 22nd. Twenty-four geese at 7s. 6d.'"
  6886	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6887	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Quite so. There you are. And underneath?"

  6891	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What have you to say now?"
  6892	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6893	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined. He drew a sovereign from
  6894	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this pocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the
  6895	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tair of a man whose disgust is too deep for words. A few yards off
  6896	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\the stopped under a lamp-post and laughed in the hearty, noiseless
  6897	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfashion which was peculiar to him.

  6899	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the 'Pink 'un'

  6918	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I've had enough of you and your geese," he shouted. "I wish you

  6922	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit? Did I buy the geese off you?"
  6923	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6924	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No; but one of them was mine all the same," whined the little
  6925	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tman.
  6926	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6927	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it."
  6928	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6929	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"She told me to ask you."
  6930	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6931	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. I've had
  6932	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tenough of it. Get out of this!" He rushed fiercely forward, and
  6933	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe inquirer flitted away into the darkness.
  6934	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6935	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road," whispered Holmes.
  6936	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Come with me, and we will see what is to be made of this
  6937	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfellow." Striding through the scattered knots of people who
  6938	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlounged round the flaring stalls, my companion speedily overtook
  6939	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe little man and touched him upon the shoulder. He sprang
  6940	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tround, and I could see in the gas-light that every vestige of
  6941	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcolour had been driven from his face.
  6942	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6943	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Who are you, then? What do you want?" he asked in a quavering
  6944	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvoice.
  6945	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6946	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You will excuse me," said Holmes blandly, "but I could not help
  6947	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\toverhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now.
  6948	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI think that I could be of assistance to you."
  6949	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6950	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?"
  6951	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6952	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other
  6953	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpeople don't know."
  6954	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6955	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But you can know nothing of this?"
  6956	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6957	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Excuse me, I know everything of it. You are endeavouring to
  6958	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttrace some geese which were sold by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton
  6959	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tRoad, to a salesman named Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr.
  6960	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWindigate, of the Alpha, and by him to his club, of which Mr.
  6961	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHenry Baker is a member."
  6962	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6963	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet," cried
  6964	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers.
  6965	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I can hardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter."
  6966	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6967	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. "In that
  6968	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcase we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this
  6969	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twind-swept market-place," said he. "But pray tell me, before we
  6970	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgo farther, who it is that I have the pleasure of assisting."
  6971	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6972	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe man hesitated for an instant. "My name is John Robinson," he
  6973	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tanswered with a sidelong glance.
  6974	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6975	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No, no; the real name," said Holmes sweetly. "It is always
  6976	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tawkward doing business with an alias."
  6977	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6978	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tA flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. "Well then,"
  6979	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsaid he, "my real name is James Ryder."
  6980	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6981	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Precisely so. Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. Pray
  6982	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstep into the cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you
  6983	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\teverything which you would wish to know."
  6984	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6985	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with
  6986	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thalf-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure
  6987	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe.
  6988	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThen he stepped into the cab, and in half an hour we were back in
  6989	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe sitting-room at Baker Street. Nothing had been said during
  6990	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tour drive, but the high, thin breathing of our new companion, and
  6991	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe claspings and unclaspings of his hands, spoke of the nervous
  6992	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttension within him.
  6993	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  6994	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Here we are!" said Holmes cheerily as we filed into the room.
  6995	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The fire looks very seasonable in this weather. You look cold,
  6996	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tMr. Ryder. Pray take the basket-chair. I will just put on my
  6997	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tslippers before we settle this little matter of yours. Now, then!
  6998	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tYou want to know what became of those geese?"
  6999	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7000	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, sir."
  7001	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7002	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Or rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine in
  7003	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich you were interested--white, with a black bar across the
  7004	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttail."
  7005	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7006	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tRyder quivered with emotion. "Oh, sir," he cried, "can you tell
  7007	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tme where it went to?"
  7008	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7009	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It came here."
  7010	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7011	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Here?"
  7012	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7013	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. I don't wonder that
  7014	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyou should take an interest in it. It laid an egg after it was
  7015	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdead--the bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen.
  7016	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI have it here in my museum."
  7017	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7018	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tOur visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece
  7019	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twith his right hand. Holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up
  7020	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe blue carbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold,
  7021	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbrilliant, many-pointed radiance. Ryder stood glaring with a
  7022	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdrawn face, uncertain whether to claim or to disown it.
  7023	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7024	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The game's up, Ryder," said Holmes quietly. "Hold up, man, or
  7025	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyou'll be into the fire! Give him an arm back into his chair,
  7026	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWatson. He's not got blood enough to go in for felony with
  7027	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\timpunity. Give him a dash of brandy. So! Now he looks a little
  7028	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmore human. What a shrimp it is, to be sure!"
  7029	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7030	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tFor a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy
  7031	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbrought a tinge of colour into his cheeks, and he sat staring
  7032	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twith frightened eyes at his accuser.
  7033	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7034	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I
  7035	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcould possibly need, so there is little which you need tell me.
  7036	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tStill, that little may as well be cleared up to make the case
  7037	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcomplete. You had heard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the
  7038	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tCountess of Morcar's?"
  7039	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7040	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It was Catherine Cusack who told me of it," said he in a
  7041	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcrackling voice.
  7042	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7043	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I see--her ladyship's waiting-maid. Well, the temptation of
  7044	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has
  7045	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbeen for better men before you; but you were not very scrupulous
  7046	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin the means you used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the
  7047	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmaking of a very pretty villain in you. You knew that this man
  7048	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHorner, the plumber, had been concerned in some such matter
  7049	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbefore, and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him.
  7050	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWhat did you do, then? You made some small job in my lady's
  7051	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\troom--you and your confederate Cusack--and you managed that he
  7052	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshould be the man sent for. Then, when he had left, you rifled
  7053	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man
  7054	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tarrested. You then--"
  7055	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7056	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tRyder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my
  7057	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcompanion's knees. "For God's sake, have mercy!" he shrieked.
  7058	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Think of my father! Of my mother! It would break their hearts. I
  7059	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnever went wrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I'll
  7060	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tswear it on a Bible. Oh, don't bring it into court! For Christ's
  7061	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsake, don't!"
  7062	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7063	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Get back into your chair!" said Holmes sternly. "It is very well
  7064	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto cringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this
  7065	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpoor Horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing."
  7066	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7067	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the
  7068	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcharge against him will break down."
  7069	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7070	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Hum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear a true account
  7071	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof the next act. How came the stone into the goose, and how came
  7072	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe goose into the open market? Tell us the truth, for there lies
  7073	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyour only hope of safety."
  7074	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7075	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tRyder passed his tongue over his parched lips. "I will tell you
  7076	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit just as it happened, sir," said he. "When Horner had been
  7077	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tarrested, it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get
  7078	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\taway with the stone at once, for I did not know at what moment
  7079	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe police might not take it into their heads to search me and my
  7080	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\troom. There was no place about the hotel where it would be safe.
  7081	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI went out, as if on some commission, and I made for my sister's
  7082	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thouse. She had married a man named Oakshott, and lived in Brixton
  7083	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tRoad, where she fattened fowls for the market. All the way there
  7084	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tevery man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective;
  7085	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring down
  7086	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmy face before I came to the Brixton Road. My sister asked me
  7087	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhat was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I
  7088	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thad been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went
  7089	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinto the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would
  7090	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbe best to do.
  7091	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7092	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and
  7093	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thas just been serving his time in Pentonville. One day he had met
  7094	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tme, and fell into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they
  7095	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcould get rid of what they stole. I knew that he would be true to
  7096	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tme, for I knew one or two things about him; so I made up my mind
  7097	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto go right on to Kilburn, where he lived, and take him into my
  7098	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tconfidence. He would show me how to turn the stone into money.
  7099	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tBut how to get to him in safety? I thought of the agonies I had
  7100	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgone through in coming from the hotel. I might at any moment be
  7101	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tseized and searched, and there would be the stone in my waistcoat
  7102	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpocket. I was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at
  7103	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe geese which were waddling about round my feet, and suddenly
  7104	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tan idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the
  7105	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbest detective that ever lived.
  7106	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7107	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the
  7108	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpick of her geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she
  7109	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas always as good as her word. I would take my goose now, and in
  7110	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit I would carry my stone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in
  7111	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe yard, and behind this I drove one of the birds--a fine big
  7112	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tone, white, with a barred tail. I caught it, and prying its bill
  7113	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\topen, I thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger
  7114	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcould reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the stone pass
  7115	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\talong its gullet and down into its crop. But the creature flapped
  7116	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the
  7117	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmatter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and
  7118	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfluttered off among the others.

  7124	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7125	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Oh,' says she, 'we've set yours aside for you--Jem's bird, we

  7127	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof them, which makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen
  7128	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfor the market.'
  7129	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t

  7135	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7136	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Never mind. I'll have the other, and I'll take it now,' said I.
  7137	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7138	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Oh, just as you like,' said she, a little huffed. 'Which is it

  7140	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7141	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the

  7143	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7144	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with you.'
  7145	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t

  7163	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'But was there another with a barred tail?' I asked, 'the same

  7166	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never

  7168	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7169	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my
  7170	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfeet would carry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the
  7171	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlot at once, and not one word would he tell me as to where they
  7172	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thad gone. You heard him yourselves to-night. Well, he has always
  7173	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tanswered me like that. My sister thinks that I am going mad.
  7174	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSometimes I think that I am myself. And now--and now I am myself

  7176	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI sold my character. God help me! God help me!" He burst into
  7177	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tconvulsive sobbing, with his face buried in his hands.
  7178	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7179	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThere was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing and
  7180	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tby the measured tapping of Sherlock Holmes' finger-tips upon the
  7181	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tedge of the table. Then my friend rose and threw open the door.
  7182	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7183	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Get out!" said he.
  7184	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7185	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What, sir! Oh, Heaven bless you!"
  7186	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7187	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No more words. Get out!"
  7188	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7189	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tAnd no more words were needed. There was a rush, a clatter upon
  7190	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe stairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running
  7191	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfootfalls from the street.
  7192	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7193	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"After all, Watson," said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his
  7194	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tclay pipe, "I am not retained by the police to supply their
  7195	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdeficiencies. If Horner were in danger it would be another thing;
  7196	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbut this fellow will not appear against him, and the case must
  7197	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcollapse. I suppose that I am commuting a felony, but it is just
  7198	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpossible that I am saving a soul. This fellow will not go wrong
  7199	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tagain; he is too terribly frightened. Send him to gaol now, and
  7200	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyou make him a gaol-bird for life. Besides, it is the season of
  7201	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tforgiveness. Chance has put in our way a most singular and
  7202	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward. If you
  7203	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twill have the goodness to touch the bell, Doctor, we will begin

  7209	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tVIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND
  7210	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7211	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tOn glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I
  7212	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend
  7213	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSherlock Holmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number
  7214	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmerely strange, but none commonplace; for, working as he did
  7215	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of
  7216	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twealth, he refused to associate himself with any investigation
  7217	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich did not tend towards the unusual, and even the fantastic.
  7218	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tOf all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any which
  7219	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpresented more singular features than that which was associated
  7220	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twith the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran.
  7221	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe events in question occurred in the early days of my
  7222	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tassociation with Holmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors
  7223	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin Baker Street. It is possible that I might have placed them
  7224	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tupon record before, but a promise of secrecy was made at the
  7225	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttime, from which I have only been freed during the last month by
  7226	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given. It
  7227	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tis perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light, for I
  7228	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the
  7229	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdeath of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the matter even
  7230	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmore terrible than the truth.
  7231	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7232	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tIt was early in April in the year '83 that I woke one morning to
  7233	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfind Sherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my
  7234	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbed. He was a late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the
  7235	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter-past seven, I
  7236	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tblinked up at him in some surprise, and perhaps just a little
  7237	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tresentment, for I was myself regular in my habits.
  7238	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7239	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Very sorry to knock you up, Watson," said he, "but it's the
  7240	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcommon lot this morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she
  7241	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tretorted upon me, and I on you."
  7242	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7243	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What is it, then--a fire?"
  7244	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7245	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a
  7246	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tconsiderable state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She
  7247	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tis waiting now in the sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander
  7248	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tabout the metropolis at this hour of the morning, and knock
  7249	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsleepy people up out of their beds, I presume that it is
  7250	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsomething very pressing which they have to communicate. Should it
  7251	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tprove to be an interesting case, you would, I am sure, wish to
  7252	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfollow it from the outset. I thought, at any rate, that I should
  7253	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcall you and give you the chance."
  7254	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7255	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything."
  7256	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7257	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his
  7258	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tprofessional investigations, and in admiring the rapid
  7259	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdeductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet always founded on a
  7260	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlogical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were
  7261	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsubmitted to him. I rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in
  7262	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room. A
  7263	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in
  7264	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe window, rose as we entered.
  7265	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7266	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Good-morning, madam," said Holmes cheerily. "My name is Sherlock
  7267	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHolmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson,
  7268	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbefore whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am
  7269	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tglad to see that Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the
  7270	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfire. Pray draw up to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot
  7271	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcoffee, for I observe that you are shivering."
  7272	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7273	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It is not cold which makes me shiver," said the woman in a low
  7274	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvoice, changing her seat as requested.
  7275	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7276	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What, then?"
  7277	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7278	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror." She raised her veil as
  7279	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshe spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable
  7280	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstate of agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless
  7281	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfrightened eyes, like those of some hunted animal. Her features
  7282	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand figure were those of a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot
  7283	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twith premature grey, and her expression was weary and haggard.
  7284	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSherlock Holmes ran her over with one of his quick,
  7285	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tall-comprehensive glances.
  7286	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7287	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You must not fear," said he soothingly, bending forward and
  7288	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpatting her forearm. "We shall soon set matters right, I have no
  7289	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdoubt. You have come in by train this morning, I see."
  7290	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7291	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You know me, then?"
  7292	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7293	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm
  7294	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof your left glove. You must have started early, and yet you had
  7295	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta good drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached
  7296	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe station."
  7297	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7298	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my
  7299	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcompanion.
  7300	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7301	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"There is no mystery, my dear madam," said he, smiling. "The left
  7302	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tarm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven
  7303	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tplaces. The marks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a
  7304	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdog-cart which throws up mud in that way, and then only when you
  7305	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsit on the left-hand side of the driver."
  7306	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7307	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct," said
  7308	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshe. "I started from home before six, reached Leatherhead at

  7310	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcan stand this strain no longer; I shall go mad if it continues.
  7311	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI have no one to turn to--none, save only one, who cares for me,

  7313	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tMr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh, whom you
  7314	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thelped in the hour of her sore need. It was from her that I had
  7315	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyour address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me,
  7316	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttoo, and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness
  7317	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich surrounds me? At present it is out of my power to reward
  7318	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyou for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be
  7319	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmarried, with the control of my own income, and then at least you

  7321	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7322	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHolmes turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small
  7323	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcase-book, which he consulted.
  7324	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7325	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Farintosh," said he. "Ah yes, I recall the case; it was
  7326	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tconcerned with an opal tiara. I think it was before your time,

  7391	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tneighbours, who had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of
  7392	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tStoke Moran back in the old family seat, he shut himself up in
  7393	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious
  7394	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tquarrels with whoever might cross his path. Violence of temper
  7395	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tapproaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the
  7396	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfamily, and in my stepfather's case it had, I believe, been
  7397	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tintensified by his long residence in the tropics. A series of
  7398	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdisgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the
  7399	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpolice-court, until at last he became the terror of the village,
  7400	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand the folks would fly at his approach, for he is a man of
  7401	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\timmense strength, and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger.
  7402	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7403	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a
  7404	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstream, and it was only by paying over all the money which I
  7405	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcould gather together that I was able to avert another public
  7406	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\texposure. He had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies,
  7407	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few
  7408	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tacres of bramble-covered land which represent the family estate,
  7409	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand would accept in return the hospitality of their tents,
  7410	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end. He has a
  7411	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpassion also for Indian animals, which are sent over to him by a
  7412	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcorrespondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon,
  7413	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the
  7414	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvillagers almost as much as their master.

  7417	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thad no great pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with
  7418	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tus, and for a long time we did all the work of the house. She was
  7419	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbut thirty at the time of her death, and yet her hair had already
  7420	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbegun to whiten, even as mine has."

  7425	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto speak to you. You can understand that, living the life which I
  7426	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave described, we were little likely to see anyone of our own
  7427	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tage and position. We had, however, an aunt, my mother's maiden
  7428	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsister, Miss Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we
  7429	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twere occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady's
  7430	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thouse. Julia went there at Christmas two years ago, and met there
  7431	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta half-pay major of marines, to whom she became engaged. My
  7432	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and
  7433	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\toffered no objection to the marriage; but within a fortnight of

  7438	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tclosed and his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his
  7439	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlids now and glanced across at his visitor.

  7444	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttime is seared into my memory. The manor-house is, as I have
  7445	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\talready said, very old, and only one wing is now inhabited. The
  7446	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor, the sitting-rooms
  7447	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbeing in the central block of the buildings. Of these bedrooms
  7448	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe first is Dr. Roylott's, the second my sister's, and the third
  7449	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmy own. There is no communication between them, but they all open
  7450	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tout into the same corridor. Do I make myself plain?"
  7451	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7452	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Perfectly so."
  7453	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7454	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That
  7455	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfatal night Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we
  7456	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tknew that he had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled
  7457	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tby the smell of the strong Indian cigars which it was his custom
  7458	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto smoke. She left her room, therefore, and came into mine, where
  7459	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshe sat for some time, chatting about her approaching wedding. At
  7460	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\televen o'clock she rose to leave me, but she paused at the door

  7472	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7473	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Because during the last few nights I have always, about three
  7474	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin the morning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper,
  7475	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand it has awakened me. I cannot tell where it came from--perhaps
  7476	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfrom the next room, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would
  7477	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tjust ask you whether you had heard it.'

  7479	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'No, I have not. It must be those wretched gipsies in the

  7481	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7482	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you

  7488	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tback at me, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her
  7489	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tkey turn in the lock."
  7490	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7491	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Indeed," said Holmes. "Was it your custom always to lock

  7493	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7494	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Always."

  7497	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7498	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I think that I mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah
  7499	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand a baboon. We had no feeling of security unless our doors were
  7500	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlocked."
  7501	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7502	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement."
  7503	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7504	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending
  7505	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmisfortune impressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect,
  7506	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twere twins, and you know how subtle are the links which bind two
  7507	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsouls which are so closely allied. It was a wild night. The wind
  7508	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas howling outside, and the rain was beating and splashing
  7509	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tagainst the windows. Suddenly, amid all the hubbub of the gale,
  7510	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthere burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman. I knew
  7511	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat it was my sister's voice. I sprang from my bed, wrapped a
  7512	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my door
  7513	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and
  7514	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had
  7515	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfallen. As I ran down the passage, my sister's door was unlocked,
  7516	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand revolved slowly upon its hinges. I stared at it
  7517	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thorror-stricken, not knowing what was about to issue from it. By
  7518	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe light of the corridor-lamp I saw my sister appear at the
  7519	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\topening, her face blanched with terror, her hands groping for
  7520	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thelp, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a
  7521	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdrunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that
  7522	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmoment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground.
  7523	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tShe writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were
  7524	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdreadfully convulsed. At first I thought that she had not
  7525	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trecognised me, but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out
  7526	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin a voice which I shall never forget, 'Oh, my God! Helen! It was
  7527	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe band! The speckled band!' There was something else which she
  7528	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twould fain have said, and she stabbed with her finger into the
  7529	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tair in the direction of the doctor's room, but a fresh convulsion
  7530	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tseized her and choked her words. I rushed out, calling loudly for
  7531	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmy stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in his
  7532	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdressing-gown. When he reached my sister's side she was
  7533	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tunconscious, and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent
  7534	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfor medical aid from the village, all efforts were in vain, for
  7535	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshe slowly sank and died without having recovered her
  7536	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tconsciousness. Such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister."
  7537	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7538	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"One moment," said Holmes, "are you sure about this whistle and
  7539	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmetallic sound? Could you swear to it?"
  7540	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7541	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is
  7542	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmy strong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of
  7543	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe gale and the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have
  7544	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbeen deceived."
  7545	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7546	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Was your sister dressed?"
  7547	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7548	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the
  7549	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcharred stump of a match, and in her left a match-box."
  7550	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7551	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when
  7552	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe alarm took place. That is important. And what conclusions did
  7553	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe coroner come to?"
  7554	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7555	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"He investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott's
  7556	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tconduct had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable
  7557	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto find any satisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that
  7558	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe door had been fastened upon the inner side, and the windows
  7559	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twere blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars,
  7560	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich were secured every night. The walls were carefully sounded,
  7561	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand were shown to be quite solid all round, and the flooring was
  7562	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\talso thoroughly examined, with the same result. The chimney is
  7563	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twide, but is barred up by four large staples. It is certain,
  7564	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttherefore, that my sister was quite alone when she met her end.
  7565	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tBesides, there were no marks of any violence upon her."
  7566	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t

  7570	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7571	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?"
  7572	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7573	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock,

  7582	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7583	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of
  7584	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdelirium, sometimes that it may have referred to some band of
  7585	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpeople, perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation. I do not
  7586	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tknow whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear

  7607	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsuddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which

  7610	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgo to bed again, however, so I dressed, and as soon as it was
  7611	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdaylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn, which
  7612	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tis opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, from whence I have come on
  7613	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthis morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your

  7629	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7630	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You have been cruelly used," said Holmes.
  7631	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7632	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist. "He
  7633	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tis a hard man," she said, "and perhaps he hardly knows his own
  7634	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstrength."
  7635	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7636	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThere was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin
  7637	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tupon his hands and stared into the crackling fire.
  7638	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7639	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"This is a very deep business," he said at last. "There are a
  7640	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthousand details which I should desire to know before I decide
  7641	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tupon our course of action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. If
  7642	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twe were to come to Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for
  7643	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tus to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your
  7644	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstepfather?"
  7645	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7646	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some
  7647	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmost important business. It is probable that he will be away all
  7648	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tday, and that there would be nothing to disturb you. We have a
  7649	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thousekeeper now, but she is old and foolish, and I could easily
  7650	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tget her out of the way."
  7651	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7652	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Excellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?"
  7653	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7654	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"By no means."
  7655	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7656	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Then we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?"
  7657	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7658	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am
  7659	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin town. But I shall return by the twelve o'clock train, so as to
  7660	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbe there in time for your coming."
  7661	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7662	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some
  7663	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsmall business matters to attend to. Will you not wait and
  7664	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbreakfast?"
  7665	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7666	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have

  7669	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tface and glided from the room.
  7670	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7671	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And what do you think of it all, Watson?" asked Sherlock Holmes,
  7672	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tleaning back in his chair.
  7673	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7674	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business."
  7675	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7676	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Dark enough and sinister enough."
  7677	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7678	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls
  7679	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tare sound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable,
  7680	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthen her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her
  7681	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmysterious end."
  7682	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7683	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the
  7684	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvery peculiar words of the dying woman?"
  7685	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7686	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I cannot think."
  7687	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7688	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"When you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of

  7691	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tan interest in preventing his stepdaughter's marriage, the dying
  7692	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tallusion to a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner

  7694	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthose metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its
  7695	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tplace, I think that there is good ground to think that the
  7696	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmystery may be cleared along those lines."
  7697	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7698	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But what, then, did the gipsies do?"
  7699	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7700	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I cannot imagine."
  7701	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7702	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I see many objections to any such theory."
  7703	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7704	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going
  7705	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto Stoke Moran this day. I want to see whether the objections are
  7706	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfatal, or if they may be explained away. But what in the name of
  7707	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe devil!"
  7708	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7709	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that
  7710	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tour door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had
  7711	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tframed himself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar
  7712	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmixture of the professional and of the agricultural, having a
  7713	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tblack top-hat, a long frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters,
  7714	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twith a hunting-crop swinging in his hand. So tall was he that his
  7715	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\that actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway, and his
  7716	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbreadth seemed to span it across from side to side. A large face,
  7717	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tseared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the sun, and
  7718	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmarked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the other
  7719	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin,
  7720	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old
  7721	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbird of prey.
  7722	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7723	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Which of you is Holmes?" asked this apparition.
  7724	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7725	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me," said my
  7726	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcompanion quietly.
  7727	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7728	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran."
  7729	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7730	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Indeed, Doctor," said Holmes blandly. "Pray take a seat."
  7731	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7732	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been here. I
  7733	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave traced her. What has she been saying to you?"
  7734	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7735	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It is a little cold for the time of the year," said Holmes.
  7736	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7737	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What has she been saying to you?" screamed the old man
  7738	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfuriously.
  7739	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7740	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But I have heard that the crocuses promise well," continued my
  7741	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcompanion imperturbably.
  7742	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7743	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Ha! You put me off, do you?" said our new visitor, taking a step
  7744	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tforward and shaking his hunting-crop. "I know you, you scoundrel!
  7745	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI have heard of you before. You are Holmes, the meddler."
  7746	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7747	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tMy friend smiled.
  7748	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7749	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Holmes, the busybody!"
  7750	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7751	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHis smile broadened.
  7752	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7753	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Holmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!"
  7754	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7755	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHolmes chuckled heartily. "Your conversation is most
  7756	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tentertaining," said he. "When you go out close the door, for
  7757	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthere is a decided draught."
  7758	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7759	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I will go when I have said my say. Don't you dare to meddle with
  7760	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmy affairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her!
  7761	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI am a dangerous man to fall foul of! See here." He stepped
  7762	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tswiftly forward, seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with
  7763	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this huge brown hands.
  7764	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7765	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"See that you keep yourself out of my grip," he snarled, and
  7766	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the
  7767	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\troom.
  7768	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7769	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"He seems a very amiable person," said Holmes, laughing. "I am
  7770	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnot quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him
  7771	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat my grip was not much more feeble than his own." As he spoke
  7772	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\the picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden effort,
  7773	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstraightened it out again.
  7774	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7775	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official
  7776	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdetective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation,
  7777	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thowever, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer
  7778	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfrom her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now,
  7779	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWatson, we shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk
  7780	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdown to Doctors' Commons, where I hope to get some data which may
  7781	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thelp us in this matter."
  7782	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7783	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7784	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tIt was nearly one o'clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his
  7785	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\texcursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled
  7786	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tover with notes and figures.
  7787	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7788	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I have seen the will of the deceased wife," said he. "To
  7789	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdetermine its exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the
  7790	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpresent prices of the investments with which it is concerned. The
  7791	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttotal income, which at the time of the wife's death was little
  7792	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshort of 1100 pounds, is now, through the fall in agricultural
  7793	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tprices, not more than 750 pounds. Each daughter can claim an
  7794	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tincome of 250 pounds, in case of marriage. It is evident,
  7795	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttherefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have
  7796	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thad a mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to
  7797	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta very serious extent. My morning's work has not been wasted,
  7798	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsince it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for
  7799	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstanding in the way of anything of the sort. And now, Watson,
  7800	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthis is too serious for dawdling, especially as the old man is
  7801	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\taware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs; so if you
  7802	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tare ready, we shall call a cab and drive to Waterloo. I should be
  7803	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvery much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your
  7804	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpocket. An Eley's No. 2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen
  7805	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twho can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a tooth-brush
  7806	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tare, I think, all that we need."
  7807	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7808	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tAt Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for
  7809	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tLeatherhead, where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove
  7810	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfor four or five miles through the lovely Surrey lanes. It was a
  7811	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tperfect day, with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the
  7812	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\theavens. The trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out
  7813	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttheir first green shoots, and the air was full of the pleasant
  7814	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsmell of the moist earth. To me at least there was a strange
  7815	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcontrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this
  7816	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsinister quest upon which we were engaged. My companion sat in
  7817	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over
  7818	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the
  7819	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdeepest thought. Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the
  7820	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshoulder, and pointed over the meadows.
  7821	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7822	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Look there!" said he.
  7823	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7824	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tA heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope,
  7825	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthickening into a grove at the highest point. From amid the
  7826	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbranches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof-tree of a
  7827	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvery old mansion.
  7828	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7829	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Stoke Moran?" said he.
  7830	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7831	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott," remarked
  7832	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe driver.
  7833	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7834	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"There is some building going on there," said Holmes; "that is
  7835	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhere we are going."
  7836	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7837	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"There's the village," said the driver, pointing to a cluster of
  7838	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\troofs some distance to the left; "but if you want to get to the
  7839	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thouse, you'll find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by
  7840	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe foot-path over the fields. There it is, where the lady is
  7841	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twalking."
  7842	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7843	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner," observed Holmes, shading
  7844	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this eyes. "Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest."
  7845	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7846	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWe got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way
  7847	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto Leatherhead.
  7848	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7849	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I thought it as well," said Holmes as we climbed the stile,
  7850	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"that this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or
  7851	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ton some definite business. It may stop his gossip.
  7852	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tGood-afternoon, Miss Stoner. You see that we have been as good as

  7854	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7855	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tOur client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a
  7856	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tface which spoke her joy. "I have been waiting so eagerly for
  7857	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyou," she cried, shaking hands with us warmly. "All has turned
  7858	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tout splendidly. Dr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely
  7859	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat he will be back before evening."
  7860	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7861	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"We have had the pleasure of making the doctor's acquaintance,"
  7862	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsaid Holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had
  7863	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\toccurred. Miss Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.
  7864	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7865	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Good heavens!" she cried, "he has followed me, then."
  7866	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7867	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"So it appears."
  7868	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7869	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What

  7871	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t

  7873	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmore cunning than himself upon his track. You must lock yourself
  7874	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tup from him to-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to
  7875	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyour aunt's at Harrow. Now, we must make the best use of our
  7876	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttime, so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to

  7878	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7879	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high
  7880	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcentral portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab,
  7881	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthrown out on each side. In one of these wings the windows were
  7882	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbroken and blocked with wooden boards, while the roof was partly
  7883	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcaved in, a picture of ruin. The central portion was in little
  7884	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbetter repair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern,
  7885	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand the blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up
  7886	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfrom the chimneys, showed that this was where the family resided.
  7887	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSome scaffolding had been erected against the end wall, and the
  7888	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstone-work had been broken into, but there were no signs of any
  7889	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tworkmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes walked slowly up and
  7890	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdown the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the
  7891	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\toutsides of the windows.
  7892	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7893	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep,
  7894	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe centre one to your sister's, and the one next to the main
  7895	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbuilding to Dr. Roylott's chamber?"
  7896	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7897	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one."
  7898	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7899	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Pending the alterations, as I understand. By the way, there does
  7900	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnot seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end
  7901	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twall."
  7902	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7903	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"There were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from
  7904	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmy room."
  7905	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7906	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Ah! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow
  7907	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open. There
  7908	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tare windows in it, of course?"
  7909	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7910	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone to pass
  7911	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthrough."
  7912	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7913	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were
  7914	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tunapproachable from that side. Now, would you have the kindness
  7915	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto go into your room and bar your shutters?"
  7916	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7917	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tMiss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination
  7918	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthrough the open window, endeavoured in every way to force the
  7919	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshutter open, but without success. There was no slit through
  7920	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich a knife could be passed to raise the bar. Then with his
  7921	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlens he tested the hinges, but they were of solid iron, built
  7922	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfirmly into the massive masonry. "Hum!" said he, scratching his
  7923	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tchin in some perplexity, "my theory certainly presents some
  7924	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdifficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they were
  7925	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon
  7926	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe matter."
  7927	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7928	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tA small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which
  7929	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe three bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third
  7930	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tchamber, so we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss
  7931	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tStoner was now sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her
  7932	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfate. It was a homely little room, with a low ceiling and a
  7933	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgaping fireplace, after the fashion of old country-houses. A
  7934	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbrown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow
  7935	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhite-counterpaned bed in another, and a dressing-table on the
  7936	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tleft-hand side of the window. These articles, with two small
  7937	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the room save
  7938	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfor a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards round and
  7939	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old
  7940	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand discoloured that it may have dated from the original building
  7941	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof the house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat
  7942	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsilent, while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down,
  7943	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttaking in every detail of the apartment.
  7944	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7945	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Where does that bell communicate with?" he asked at last
  7946	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpointing to a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the
  7947	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttassel actually lying upon the pillow.
  7948	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7949	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It goes to the housekeeper's room."
  7950	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7951	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It looks newer than the other things?"
  7952	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7953	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago."
  7954	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7955	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Your sister asked for it, I suppose?"
  7956	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7957	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we
  7958	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twanted for ourselves."
  7959	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7960	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there.
  7961	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tYou will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to
  7962	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthis floor." He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in
  7963	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining
  7964	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tminutely the cracks between the boards. Then he did the same with
  7965	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe wood-work with which the chamber was panelled. Finally he
  7966	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twalked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and
  7967	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin running his eye up and down the wall. Finally he took the
  7968	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.
  7969	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7970	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Why, it's a dummy," said he.
  7971	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7972	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Won't it ring?"
  7973	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7974	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting.
  7975	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tYou can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where
  7976	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe little opening for the ventilator is."
  7977	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7978	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"How very absurd! I never noticed that before."
  7979	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7980	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Very strange!" muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. "There are
  7981	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tone or two very singular points about this room. For example,
  7982	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhat a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another
  7983	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\troom, when, with the same trouble, he might have communicated
  7984	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twith the outside air!"
  7985	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7986	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"That is also quite modern," said the lady.
  7987	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7988	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Done about the same time as the bell-rope?" remarked Holmes.
  7989	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7990	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that
  7991	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttime."
  7992	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7993	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"They seem to have been of a most interesting character--dummy
  7994	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your
  7995	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpermission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into
  7996	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe inner apartment."
  7997	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  7998	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tDr. Grimesby Roylott's chamber was larger than that of his
  7999	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstep-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a small
  8000	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twooden shelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an
  8001	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tarmchair beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a
  8002	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tround table, and a large iron safe were the principal things
  8003	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich met the eye. Holmes walked slowly round and examined each
  8004	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand all of them with the keenest interest.
  8005	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8006	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What's in here?" he asked, tapping the safe.
  8007	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8008	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"My stepfather's business papers."
  8009	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8010	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Oh! you have seen inside, then?"
  8011	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8012	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Only once, some years ago. I remember that it was full of
  8013	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpapers."
  8014	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8015	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"There isn't a cat in it, for example?"
  8016	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8017	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No. What a strange idea!"
  8018	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8019	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, look at this!" He took up a small saucer of milk which
  8020	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstood on the top of it.
  8021	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8022	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No; we don't keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon."
  8023	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8024	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a
  8025	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsaucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I
  8026	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdaresay. There is one point which I should wish to determine." He
  8027	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsquatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat
  8028	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof it with the greatest attention.
  8029	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8030	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Thank you. That is quite settled," said he, rising and putting
  8031	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this lens in his pocket. "Hullo! Here is something interesting!"
  8032	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8033	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on
  8034	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tone corner of the bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself
  8035	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand tied so as to make a loop of whipcord.
  8036	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8037	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What do you make of that, Watson?"
  8038	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8039	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It's a common enough lash. But I don't know why it should be
  8040	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttied."
  8041	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8042	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it's a wicked world,
  8043	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst
  8044	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof all. I think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and
  8045	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twith your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn."
  8046	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8047	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI had never seen my friend's face so grim or his brow so dark as
  8048	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit was when we turned from the scene of this investigation. We
  8049	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thad walked several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss
  8050	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tStoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he
  8051	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\troused himself from his reverie.
  8052	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8053	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It is very essential, Miss Stoner," said he, "that you should
  8054	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tabsolutely follow my advice in every respect."
  8055	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8056	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I shall most certainly do so."
  8057	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8058	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may
  8059	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdepend upon your compliance."
  8060	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8061	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I assure you that I am in your hands."
  8062	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8063	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in
  8064	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyour room."
  8065	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8066	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tBoth Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.
  8067	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8068	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the
  8069	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvillage inn over there?"
  8070	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8071	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, that is the Crown."
  8072	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8073	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Very good. Your windows would be visible from there?"
  8074	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8075	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Certainly."
  8076	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8077	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a
  8078	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\theadache, when your stepfather comes back. Then when you hear him
  8079	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tretire for the night, you must open the shutters of your window,
  8080	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tundo the hasp, put your lamp there as a signal to us, and then
  8081	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twithdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want
  8082	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinto the room which you used to occupy. I have no doubt that, in
  8083	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tspite of the repairs, you could manage there for one night."
  8084	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t

  8088	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8089	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But what will you do?"

  8096	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8097	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Perhaps I have."
  8098	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8099	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Then, for pity's sake, tell me what was the cause of my sister's

  8101	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8102	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak."
  8103	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t

  8106	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8107	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more

  8109	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tDr. Roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain.
  8110	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tGood-bye, and be brave, for if you will do what I have told you,
  8111	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyou may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers

  8113	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8114	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and
  8115	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsitting-room at the Crown Inn. They were on the upper floor, and
  8116	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfrom our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and
  8117	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof the inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw
  8118	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tDr. Grimesby Roylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside
  8119	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe little figure of the lad who drove him. The boy had some
  8120	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tslight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard
  8121	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe hoarse roar of the doctor's voice and saw the fury with which
  8122	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\the shook his clinched fists at him. The trap drove on, and a few
  8123	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tminutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as
  8124	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.
  8125	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8126	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Do you know, Watson," said Holmes as we sat together in the
  8127	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgathering darkness, "I have really some scruples as to taking you
  8128	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto-night. There is a distinct element of danger."
  8129	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8130	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Can I be of assistance?"
  8131	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8132	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Your presence might be invaluable."
  8133	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8134	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Then I shall certainly come."
  8135	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8136	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It is very kind of you."
  8137	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8138	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You speak of danger. You have evidently seen more in these rooms
  8139	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthan was visible to me."
  8140	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8141	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine
  8142	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat you saw all that I did."
  8143	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8144	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose
  8145	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat could answer I confess is more than I can imagine."
  8146	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8147	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You saw the ventilator, too?"
  8148	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8149	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to
  8150	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave a small opening between two rooms. It was so small that a
  8151	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trat could hardly pass through."
  8152	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8153	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to
  8154	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tStoke Moran."
  8155	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8156	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"My dear Holmes!"
  8157	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8158	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Oh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that her
  8159	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsister could smell Dr. Roylott's cigar. Now, of course that
  8160	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsuggested at once that there must be a communication between the
  8161	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttwo rooms. It could only be a small one, or it would have been
  8162	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tremarked upon at the coroner's inquiry. I deduced a ventilator."
  8163	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8164	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But what harm can there be in that?"
  8165	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8166	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A
  8167	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tventilator is made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the
  8168	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbed dies. Does not that strike you?"
  8169	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8170	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I cannot as yet see any connection."
  8171	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8172	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?"
  8173	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8174	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No."
  8175	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8176	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened
  8177	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlike that before?"
  8178	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8179	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I cannot say that I have."
  8180	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8181	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same
  8182	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trelative position to the ventilator and to the rope--or so we may
  8183	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcall it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull."
  8184	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8185	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Holmes," I cried, "I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at.
  8186	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWe are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible
  8187	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcrime."
  8188	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8189	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Subtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong
  8190	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\the is the first of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge.
  8191	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tPalmer and Pritchard were among the heads of their profession.
  8192	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThis man strikes even deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall
  8193	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbe able to strike deeper still. But we shall have horrors enough
  8194	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbefore the night is over; for goodness' sake let us have a quiet
  8195	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more
  8196	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcheerful."
  8197	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8198	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8199	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tAbout nine o'clock the light among the trees was extinguished,
  8200	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand all was dark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours
  8201	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpassed slowly away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of
  8202	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\televen, a single bright light shone out right in front of us.
  8203	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8204	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"That is our signal," said Holmes, springing to his feet; "it
  8205	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcomes from the middle window."
  8206	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8207	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tAs we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord,
  8208	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\texplaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance,
  8209	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand that it was possible that we might spend the night there. A
  8210	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmoment later we were out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing
  8211	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin our faces, and one yellow light twinkling in front of us
  8212	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthrough the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand.
  8213	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8214	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThere was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for
  8215	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tunrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall. Making our way
  8216	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tamong the trees, we reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about
  8217	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel
  8218	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted
  8219	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tchild, who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and
  8220	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthen ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness.
  8221	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8222	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"My God!" I whispered; "did you see it?"
  8223	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8224	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHolmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like
  8225	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta vice upon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low
  8226	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlaugh and put his lips to my ear.
  8227	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8228	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It is a nice household," he murmured. "That is the baboon."
  8229	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8230	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected. There
  8231	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas a cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders
  8232	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tat any moment. I confess that I felt easier in my mind when,
  8233	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tafter following Holmes' example and slipping off my shoes, I
  8234	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfound myself inside the bedroom. My companion noiselessly closed
  8235	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe shutters, moved the lamp onto the table, and cast his eyes
  8236	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tround the room. All was as we had seen it in the daytime. Then
  8237	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcreeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand, he whispered
  8238	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinto my ear again so gently that it was all that I could do to
  8239	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdistinguish the words:
  8240	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8241	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The least sound would be fatal to our plans."
  8242	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8243	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI nodded to show that I had heard.
  8244	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8245	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"We must sit without light. He would see it through the
  8246	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tventilator."
  8247	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8248	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI nodded again.
  8249	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8250	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your
  8251	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpistol ready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of
  8252	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe bed, and you in that chair."
  8253	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8254	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.
  8255	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8256	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHolmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon
  8257	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe bed beside him. By it he laid the box of matches and the
  8258	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstump of a candle. Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left
  8259	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin darkness.
  8260	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8261	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHow shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a
  8262	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsound, not even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my
  8263	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcompanion sat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same
  8264	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstate of nervous tension in which I was myself. The shutters cut
  8265	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\toff the least ray of light, and we waited in absolute darkness.
  8266	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8267	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tFrom outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at
  8268	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tour very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that
  8269	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe cheetah was indeed at liberty. Far away we could hear the
  8270	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdeep tones of the parish clock, which boomed out every quarter of
  8271	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tan hour. How long they seemed, those quarters! Twelve struck, and
  8272	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tone and two and three, and still we sat waiting silently for
  8273	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhatever might befall.
  8274	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8275	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSuddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the
  8276	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdirection of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was
  8277	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsucceeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal.
  8278	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSomeone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle
  8279	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsound of movement, and then all was silent once more, though the
  8280	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsmell grew stronger. For half an hour I sat with straining ears.
  8281	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThen suddenly another sound became audible--a very gentle,
  8282	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsoothing sound, like that of a small jet of steam escaping
  8283	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcontinually from a kettle. The instant that we heard it, Holmes
  8284	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with
  8285	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this cane at the bell-pull.
  8286	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8287	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You see it, Watson?" he yelled. "You see it?"
  8288	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8289	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tBut I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I
  8290	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\theard a low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my
  8291	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tweary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which
  8292	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmy friend lashed so savagely. I could, however, see that his face
  8293	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing. He had
  8294	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when
  8295	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsuddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most
  8296	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thorrible cry to which I have ever listened. It swelled up louder
  8297	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled
  8298	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin the one dreadful shriek. They say that away down in the
  8299	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvillage, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the
  8300	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsleepers from their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, and I
  8301	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstood gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it
  8302	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thad died away into the silence from which it rose.
  8303	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8304	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What can it mean?" I gasped.
  8305	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8306	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It means that it is all over," Holmes answered. "And perhaps,
  8307	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tafter all, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will
  8308	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tenter Dr. Roylott's room."
  8309	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8310	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWith a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the
  8311	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcorridor. Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply
  8312	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfrom within. Then he turned the handle and entered, I at his
  8313	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\theels, with the cocked pistol in my hand.
  8314	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8315	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tIt was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a
  8316	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant
  8317	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbeam of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar.
  8318	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tBeside this table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott
  8319	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tclad in a long grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding
  8320	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbeneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers.
  8321	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tAcross his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we
  8322	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thad noticed during the day. His chin was cocked upward and his
  8323	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\teyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the
  8324	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with
  8325	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbrownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round his
  8326	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thead. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.
  8327	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8328	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The band! the speckled band!" whispered Holmes.
  8329	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8330	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began
  8331	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat
  8332	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdiamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.
  8333	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8334	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It is a swamp adder!" cried Holmes; "the deadliest snake in
  8335	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tIndia. He has died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence
  8336	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdoes, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls
  8337	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinto the pit which he digs for another. Let us thrust this
  8338	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcreature back into its den, and we can then remove Miss Stoner to
  8339	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsome place of shelter and let the county police know what has
  8340	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thappened."
  8341	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8342	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tAs he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man's lap,
  8343	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand throwing the noose round the reptile's neck he drew it from
  8344	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tits horrid perch and, carrying it at arm's length, threw it into
  8345	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe iron safe, which he closed upon it.
  8346	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8347	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSuch are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of
  8348	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tStoke Moran. It is not necessary that I should prolong a
  8349	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnarrative which has already run to too great a length by telling
  8350	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thow we broke the sad news to the terrified girl, how we conveyed
  8351	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ther by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at Harrow,
  8352	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof how the slow process of official inquiry came to the
  8353	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tconclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly
  8354	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tplaying with a dangerous pet. The little which I had yet to learn
  8355	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back
  8356	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnext day.
  8357	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8358	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I had," said he, "come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which
  8359	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from
  8360	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinsufficient data. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of
  8361	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe word 'band,' which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to
  8362	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\texplain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of
  8363	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tby the light of her match, were sufficient to put me upon an
  8364	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tentirely wrong scent. I can only claim the merit that I instantly
  8365	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\treconsidered my position when, however, it became clear to me
  8366	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not
  8367	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcome either from the window or the door. My attention was
  8368	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tspeedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to this
  8369	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed. The
  8370	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdiscovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to
  8371	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was
  8372	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthere as a bridge for something passing through the hole and
  8373	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcoming to the bed. The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me,
  8374	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand when I coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was
  8375	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfurnished with a supply of creatures from India, I felt that I
  8376	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas probably on the right track. The idea of using a form of
  8377	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpoison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical
  8378	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttest was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless
  8379	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tman who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity with which such
  8380	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta poison would take effect would also, from his point of view, be
  8381	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tan advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who could
  8382	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdistinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where
  8383	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the
  8384	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhistle. Of course he must recall the snake before the morning
  8385	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlight revealed it to the victim. He had trained it, probably by
  8386	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe use of the milk which we saw, to return to him when summoned.
  8387	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHe would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he
  8388	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down the
  8389	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trope and land on the bed. It might or might not bite the
  8390	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\toccupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but
  8391	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsooner or later she must fall a victim.
  8392	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8393	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his
  8394	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\troom. An inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in
  8395	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe habit of standing on it, which of course would be necessary
  8396	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin order that he should reach the ventilator. The sight of the
  8397	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsafe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord were enough to
  8398	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfinally dispel any doubts which may have remained. The metallic
  8399	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tclang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather
  8400	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant.
  8401	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHaving once made up my mind, you know the steps which I took in
  8402	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\torder to put the matter to the proof. I heard the creature hiss
  8403	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tas I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly lit the
  8404	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlight and attacked it."
  8405	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8406	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"With the result of driving it through the ventilator."
  8407	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8408	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master
  8409	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tat the other side. Some of the blows of my cane came home and
  8410	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\troused its snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person
  8411	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit saw. In this way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr.
  8412	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tGrimesby Roylott's death, and I cannot say that it is likely to
  8413	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tweigh very heavily upon my conscience."

  8417	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tIX. THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEER'S THUMB
  8418	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8419	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tOf all the problems which have been submitted to my friend, Mr.
  8420	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSherlock Holmes, for solution during the years of our intimacy,
  8421	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthere were only two which I was the means of introducing to his
  8422	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnotice--that of Mr. Hatherley's thumb, and that of Colonel
  8423	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWarburton's madness. Of these the latter may have afforded a
  8424	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfiner field for an acute and original observer, but the other was
  8425	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tso strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that
  8426	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit may be the more worthy of being placed upon record, even if it
  8427	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of
  8428	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\treasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results. The story
  8429	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thas, I believe, been told more than once in the newspapers, but,
  8430	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlike all such narratives, its effect is much less striking when
  8431	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tset forth en bloc in a single half-column of print than when the
  8432	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfacts slowly evolve before your own eyes, and the mystery clears
  8433	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads
  8434	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ton to the complete truth. At the time the circumstances made a
  8435	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdeep impression upon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly
  8436	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tserved to weaken the effect.
  8437	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8438	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tIt was in the summer of '89, not long after my marriage, that the
  8439	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tevents occurred which I am now about to summarise. I had returned
  8440	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto civil practice and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker
  8441	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tStreet rooms, although I continually visited him and occasionally
  8442	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\teven persuaded him to forgo his Bohemian habits so far as to come
  8443	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand visit us. My practice had steadily increased, and as I
  8444	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thappened to live at no very great distance from Paddington
  8445	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tStation, I got a few patients from among the officials. One of
  8446	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthese, whom I had cured of a painful and lingering disease, was
  8447	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnever weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send
  8448	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tme on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence.
  8449	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8450	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tOne morning, at a little before seven o'clock, I was awakened by
  8451	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come
  8452	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfrom Paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room. I
  8453	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdressed hurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases
  8454	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twere seldom trivial, and hastened downstairs. As I descended, my
  8455	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\told ally, the guard, came out of the room and closed the door
  8456	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttightly behind him.
  8457	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8458	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I've got him here," he whispered, jerking his thumb over his
  8459	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshoulder; "he's all right."
  8460	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8461	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What is it, then?" I asked, for his manner suggested that it was
  8462	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsome strange creature which he had caged up in my room.
  8463	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8464	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It's a new patient," he whispered. "I thought I'd bring him
  8465	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tround myself; then he couldn't slip away. There he is, all safe
  8466	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand sound. I must go now, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the
  8467	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsame as you." And off he went, this trusty tout, without even
  8468	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgiving me time to thank him.
  8469	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8470	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the
  8471	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttable. He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a
  8472	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsoft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books. Round one of
  8473	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this hands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all
  8474	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tover with bloodstains. He was young, not more than
  8475	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfive-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong, masculine face; but
  8476	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\the was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who
  8477	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas suffering from some strong agitation, which it took all his
  8478	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstrength of mind to control.
  8479	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8480	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor," said he, "but I
  8481	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave had a very serious accident during the night. I came in by
  8482	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttrain this morning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I
  8483	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmight find a doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me
  8484	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\there. I gave the maid a card, but I see that she has left it upon
  8485	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe side-table."
  8486	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8487	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI took it up and glanced at it. "Mr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic
  8488	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tengineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor)." That was the name,
  8489	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstyle, and abode of my morning visitor. "I regret that I have
  8490	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tkept you waiting," said I, sitting down in my library-chair. "You
  8491	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tare fresh from a night journey, I understand, which is in itself
  8492	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta monotonous occupation."
  8493	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8494	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Oh, my night could not be called monotonous," said he, and
  8495	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlaughed. He laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note,
  8496	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tleaning back in his chair and shaking his sides. All my medical
  8497	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinstincts rose up against that laugh.
  8498	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8499	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Stop it!" I cried; "pull yourself together!" and I poured out
  8500	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsome water from a caraffe.
  8501	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8502	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tIt was useless, however. He was off in one of those hysterical
  8503	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\toutbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis
  8504	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tis over and gone. Presently he came to himself once more, very
  8505	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tweary and pale-looking.
  8506	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8507	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I have been making a fool of myself," he gasped.
  8508	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8509	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Not at all. Drink this." I dashed some brandy into the water,
  8510	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks.
  8511	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8512	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"That's better!" said he. "And now, Doctor, perhaps you would
  8513	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tkindly attend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb
  8514	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tused to be."
  8515	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8516	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHe unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand. It gave even
  8517	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmy hardened nerves a shudder to look at it. There were four
  8518	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tprotruding fingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where the
  8519	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthumb should have been. It had been hacked or torn right out from
  8520	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe roots.
  8521	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8522	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Good heavens!" I cried, "this is a terrible injury. It must have
  8523	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbled considerably."
  8524	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8525	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, it did. I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must
  8526	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave been senseless for a long time. When I came to I found that
  8527	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit was still bleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief very
  8528	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttightly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig."
  8529	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8530	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Excellent! You should have been a surgeon."
  8531	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8532	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own
  8533	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tprovince."
  8534	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8535	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"This has been done," said I, examining the wound, "by a very
  8536	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\theavy and sharp instrument."
  8537	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8538	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"A thing like a cleaver," said he.
  8539	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8540	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"An accident, I presume?"
  8541	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8542	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"By no means."
  8543	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8544	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What! a murderous attack?"
  8545	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8546	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Very murderous indeed."
  8547	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8548	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You horrify me."
  8549	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8550	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered
  8551	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit over with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages. He lay back
  8552	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twithout wincing, though he bit his lip from time to time.
  8553	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8554	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"How is that?" I asked when I had finished.
  8555	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8556	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Capital! Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man.
  8557	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI was very weak, but I have had a good deal to go through."
  8558	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8559	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Perhaps you had better not speak of the matter. It is evidently
  8560	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttrying to your nerves."
  8561	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8562	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Oh, no, not now. I shall have to tell my tale to the police;
  8563	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbut, between ourselves, if it were not for the convincing
  8564	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tevidence of this wound of mine, I should be surprised if they
  8565	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbelieved my statement, for it is a very extraordinary one, and I
  8566	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave not much in the way of proof with which to back it up; and,
  8567	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\teven if they believe me, the clues which I can give them are so
  8568	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvague that it is a question whether justice will be done."
  8569	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8570	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Ha!" cried I, "if it is anything in the nature of a problem
  8571	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich you desire to see solved, I should strongly recommend you
  8572	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto come to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, before you go to the

  8574	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8575	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Oh, I have heard of that fellow," answered my visitor, "and I
  8576	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshould be very glad if he would take the matter up, though of
  8577	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcourse I must use the official police as well. Would you give me
  8578	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tan introduction to him?"
  8579	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8580	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I'll do better. I'll take you round to him myself."
  8581	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8582	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I should be immensely obliged to you."
  8583	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8584	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"We'll call a cab and go together. We shall just be in time to

  8586	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8587	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story."
  8588	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8589	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Then my servant will call a cab, and I shall be with you in an
  8590	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinstant." I rushed upstairs, explained the matter shortly to my
  8591	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twife, and in five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with my
  8592	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnew acquaintance to Baker Street.
  8593	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8594	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his
  8595	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsitting-room in his dressing-gown, reading the agony column of The
  8596	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tTimes and smoking his before-breakfast pipe, which was composed

  8600	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined us in a hearty meal.
  8601	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWhen it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the

  8616	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHolmes sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded
  8617	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\texpression which veiled his keen and eager nature, while I sat
  8618	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\topposite to him, and we listened in silence to the strange story
  8619	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich our visitor detailed to us.
  8620	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8621	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You must know," said he, "that I am an orphan and a bachelor,
  8622	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tresiding alone in lodgings in London. By profession I am a
  8623	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thydraulic engineer, and I have had considerable experience of my
  8624	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twork during the seven years that I was apprenticed to Venner &
  8625	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tMatheson, the well-known firm, of Greenwich. Two years ago,
  8626	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thaving served my time, and having also come into a fair sum of
  8627	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmoney through my poor father's death, I determined to start in
  8628	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbusiness for myself and took professional chambers in Victoria
  8629	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tStreet.
  8630	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8631	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in
  8632	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbusiness a dreary experience. To me it has been exceptionally so.
  8633	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tDuring two years I have had three consultations and one small
  8634	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tjob, and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought
  8635	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tme. My gross takings amount to 27 pounds 10s. Every day, from
  8636	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnine in the morning until four in the afternoon, I waited in my
  8637	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlittle den, until at last my heart began to sink, and I came to
  8638	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbelieve that I should never have any practice at all.
  8639	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8640	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the
  8641	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\toffice, my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who
  8642	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twished to see me upon business. He brought up a card, too, with
  8643	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe name of 'Colonel Lysander Stark' engraved upon it. Close at
  8644	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this heels came the colonel himself, a man rather over the middle
  8645	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsize, but of an exceeding thinness. I do not think that I have
  8646	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tever seen so thin a man. His whole face sharpened away into nose
  8647	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand chin, and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over
  8648	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this outstanding bones. Yet this emaciation seemed to be his
  8649	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnatural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was bright, his
  8650	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstep brisk, and his bearing assured. He was plainly but neatly
  8651	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdressed, and his age, I should judge, would be nearer forty than
  8652	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthirty.
  8653	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8654	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Mr. Hatherley?' said he, with something of a German accent.
  8655	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t'You have been recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley, as being a man
  8656	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twho is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet
  8657	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand capable of preserving a secret.'
  8658	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8659	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an
  8660	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\taddress. 'May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?'
  8661	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8662	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that just

  8664	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tan orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in London.'
  8665	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8666	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'That is quite correct,' I answered; 'but you will excuse me if
  8667	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI say that I cannot see how all this bears upon my professional

  8673	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsecrecy is quite essential--absolute secrecy, you understand, and
  8674	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than
  8675	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfrom one who lives in the bosom of his family.'
  8676	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8677	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'If I promise to keep a secret,' said I, 'you may absolutely
  8678	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdepend upon my doing so.'

  8682	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8683	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Do you promise, then?' said he at last.
  8684	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8685	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Yes, I promise.'

  8691	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t

  8693	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tacross the room he flung open the door. The passage outside was
  8694	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tempty.

  8696	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'That's all right,' said he, coming back. 'I know that clerks are
  8697	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsometimes curious as to their master's affairs. Now we can talk
  8698	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin safety.' He drew up his chair very close to mine and began to
  8699	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look.

  8701	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"A feeling of repulsion, and of something akin to fear had begun
  8702	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man.
  8703	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tEven my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from

  8778	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tplace--within ten miles of Reading. I was fortunate enough to
  8779	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdiscover that there was a deposit of fuller's-earth in one of my
  8780	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfields. On examining it, however, I found that this deposit was a
  8781	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcomparatively small one, and that it formed a link between two
  8782	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvery much larger ones upon the right and left--both of them,
  8783	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thowever, in the grounds of my neighbours. These good people were
  8784	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tabsolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was
  8785	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tquite as valuable as a gold-mine. Naturally, it was to my
  8786	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinterest to buy their land before they discovered its true value,
  8787	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbut unfortunately I had no capital by which I could do this. I
  8788	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttook a few of my friends into the secret, however, and they
  8789	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsuggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little

  8791	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tenable us to buy the neighbouring fields. This we have now been
  8792	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdoing for some time, and in order to help us in our operations we
  8793	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\terected a hydraulic press. This press, as I have already
  8794	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\texplained, has got out of order, and we wish your advice upon the
  8795	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsubject. We guard our secret very jealously, however, and if it

  8797	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlittle house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if the facts

  8799	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfields and carrying out our plans. That is why I have made you
  8800	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpromise me that you will not tell a human being that you are
  8801	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgoing to Eyford to-night. I hope that I make it all plain?'

  8838	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tonly passenger who got out there, and there was no one upon the
  8839	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tplatform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern. As I passed
  8840	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tout through the wicket gate, however, I found my acquaintance of
  8841	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side. Without a
  8842	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tword he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage, the door
  8843	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof which was standing open. He drew up the windows on either
  8844	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tside, tapped on the wood-work, and away we went as fast as the
  8845	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thorse could go."
  8846	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8847	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"One horse?" interjected Holmes.
  8848	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8849	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, only one."
  8850	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8851	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Did you observe the colour?"
  8852	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8853	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the
  8854	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcarriage. It was a chestnut."
  8855	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8856	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Tired-looking or fresh?"
  8857	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8858	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Oh, fresh and glossy."
  8859	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8860	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Thank you. I am sorry to have interrupted you. Pray continue
  8861	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyour most interesting statement."
  8862	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8863	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Away we went then, and we drove for at least an hour. Colonel
  8864	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tLysander Stark had said that it was only seven miles, but I
  8865	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshould think, from the rate that we seemed to go, and from the
  8866	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttime that we took, that it must have been nearer twelve. He sat
  8867	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tat my side in silence all the time, and I was aware, more than
  8868	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tonce when I glanced in his direction, that he was looking at me
  8869	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twith great intensity. The country roads seem to be not very good
  8870	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin that part of the world, for we lurched and jolted terribly. I
  8871	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttried to look out of the windows to see something of where we
  8872	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twere, but they were made of frosted glass, and I could make out
  8873	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light. Now
  8874	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the
  8875	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tjourney, but the colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the
  8876	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tconversation soon flagged. At last, however, the bumping of the
  8877	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\troad was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive,
  8878	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand the carriage came to a stand. Colonel Lysander Stark sprang
  8879	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tout, and, as I followed after him, pulled me swiftly into a porch
  8880	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich gaped in front of us. We stepped, as it were, right out of
  8881	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe carriage and into the hall, so that I failed to catch the
  8882	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmost fleeting glance of the front of the house. The instant that
  8883	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us,
  8884	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage
  8885	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdrove away.
  8886	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8887	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled
  8888	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tabout looking for matches and muttering under his breath.
  8889	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSuddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage, and a
  8890	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlong, golden bar of light shot out in our direction. It grew
  8891	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbroader, and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand, which she
  8892	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\theld above her head, pushing her face forward and peering at us.
  8893	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI could see that she was pretty, and from the gloss with which
  8894	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it was a rich
  8895	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmaterial. She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as
  8896	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthough asking a question, and when my companion answered in a
  8897	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly
  8898	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfell from her hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered
  8899	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsomething in her ear, and then, pushing her back into the room
  8900	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfrom whence she had come, he walked towards me again with the
  8901	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlamp in his hand.
  8902	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8903	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a
  8904	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfew minutes,' said he, throwing open another door. It was a
  8905	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tquiet, little, plainly furnished room, with a round table in the
  8906	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcentre, on which several German books were scattered. Colonel
  8907	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tStark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the
  8908	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdoor. 'I shall not keep you waiting an instant,' said he, and
  8909	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvanished into the darkness.
  8910	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8911	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my
  8912	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tignorance of German I could see that two of them were treatises
  8913	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ton science, the others being volumes of poetry. Then I walked
  8914	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tacross to the window, hoping that I might catch some glimpse of
  8915	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe country-side, but an oak shutter, heavily barred, was folded
  8916	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tacross it. It was a wonderfully silent house. There was an old
  8917	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tclock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage, but otherwise
  8918	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\teverything was deadly still. A vague feeling of uneasiness began
  8919	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto steal over me. Who were these German people, and what were
  8920	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthey doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way place? And
  8921	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhere was the place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was
  8922	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tall I knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no
  8923	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tidea. For that matter, Reading, and possibly other large towns,
  8924	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twere within that radius, so the place might not be so secluded,
  8925	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tafter all. Yet it was quite certain, from the absolute stillness,
  8926	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat we were in the country. I paced up and down the room,
  8927	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thumming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling
  8928	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat I was thoroughly earning my fifty-guinea fee.
  8929	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8930	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Suddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the
  8931	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tutter stillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. The woman
  8932	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas standing in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind
  8933	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ther, the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and
  8934	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbeautiful face. I could see at a glance that she was sick with
  8935	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfear, and the sight sent a chill to my own heart. She held up one
  8936	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshaking finger to warn me to be silent, and she shot a few
  8937	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhispered words of broken English at me, her eyes glancing back,
  8938	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlike those of a frightened horse, into the gloom behind her.
  8939	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8940	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'I would go,' said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to
  8941	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tspeak calmly; 'I would go. I should not stay here. There is no
  8942	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgood for you to do.'
  8943	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8944	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'But, madam,' said I, 'I have not yet done what I came for. I
  8945	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcannot possibly leave until I have seen the machine.'
  8946	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8947	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'It is not worth your while to wait,' she went on. 'You can pass
  8948	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthrough the door; no one hinders.' And then, seeing that I smiled
  8949	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and
  8950	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmade a step forward, with her hands wrung together. 'For the love
  8951	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof Heaven!' she whispered, 'get away from here before it is too
  8952	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlate!'
  8953	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8954	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to
  8955	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tengage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way. I
  8956	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthought of my fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of
  8957	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe unpleasant night which seemed to be before me. Was it all to
  8958	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgo for nothing? Why should I slink away without having carried
  8959	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tout my commission, and without the payment which was my due? This
  8960	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twoman might, for all I knew, be a monomaniac. With a stout
  8961	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbearing, therefore, though her manner had shaken me more than I
  8962	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcared to confess, I still shook my head and declared my intention
  8963	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof remaining where I was. She was about to renew her entreaties
  8964	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhen a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several footsteps
  8965	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas heard upon the stairs. She listened for an instant, threw up
  8966	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ther hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and
  8967	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tas noiselessly as she had come.
  8968	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8969	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man
  8970	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twith a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double
  8971	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tchin, who was introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson.
  8972	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8973	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'This is my secretary and manager,' said the colonel. 'By the
  8974	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tway, I was under the impression that I left this door shut just
  8975	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnow. I fear that you have felt the draught.'
  8976	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8977	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'On the contrary,' said I, 'I opened the door myself because I
  8978	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfelt the room to be a little close.'
  8979	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8980	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"He shot one of his suspicious looks at me. 'Perhaps we had
  8981	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbetter proceed to business, then,' said he. 'Mr. Ferguson and I
  8982	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twill take you up to see the machine.'
  8983	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8984	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'I had better put my hat on, I suppose.'
  8985	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8986	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Oh, no, it is in the house.'
  8987	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8988	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'What, you dig fuller's-earth in the house?'
  8989	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8990	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'No, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind that.
  8991	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tAll we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us
  8992	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tknow what is wrong with it.'
  8993	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  8994	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"We went upstairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the
  8995	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfat manager and I behind him. It was a labyrinth of an old house,
  8996	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twith corridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little
  8997	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlow doors, the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the
  8998	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgenerations who had crossed them. There were no carpets and no
  8999	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsigns of any furniture above the ground floor, while the plaster
  9000	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas peeling off the walls, and the damp was breaking through in
  9001	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgreen, unhealthy blotches. I tried to put on as unconcerned an
  9002	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tair as possible, but I had not forgotten the warnings of the
  9003	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlady, even though I disregarded them, and I kept a keen eye upon
  9004	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmy two companions. Ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent
  9005	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tman, but I could see from the little that he said that he was at
  9006	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tleast a fellow-countryman.
  9007	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9008	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which
  9009	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\the unlocked. Within was a small, square room, in which the three
  9010	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof us could hardly get at one time. Ferguson remained outside,
  9011	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand the colonel ushered me in.
  9012	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9013	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'We are now,' said he, 'actually within the hydraulic press, and
  9014	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were
  9015	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto turn it on. The ceiling of this small chamber is really the
  9016	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tend of the descending piston, and it comes down with the force of
  9017	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmany tons upon this metal floor. There are small lateral columns
  9018	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof water outside which receive the force, and which transmit and
  9019	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmultiply it in the manner which is familiar to you. The machine
  9020	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgoes readily enough, but there is some stiffness in the working
  9021	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof it, and it has lost a little of its force. Perhaps you will
  9022	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set
  9023	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit right.'
  9024	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9025	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very
  9026	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthoroughly. It was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of
  9027	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\texercising enormous pressure. When I passed outside, however, and
  9028	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpressed down the levers which controlled it, I knew at once by
  9029	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe whishing sound that there was a slight leakage, which allowed
  9030	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders. An
  9031	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\texamination showed that one of the india-rubber bands which was
  9032	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tround the head of a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to
  9033	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfill the socket along which it worked. This was clearly the cause
  9034	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my companions, who
  9035	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfollowed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical
  9036	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tquestions as to how they should proceed to set it right. When I
  9037	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thad made it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the
  9038	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmachine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity.
  9039	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tIt was obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller's-earth
  9040	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas the merest fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose
  9041	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a
  9042	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpurpose. The walls were of wood, but the floor consisted of a
  9043	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlarge iron trough, and when I came to examine it I could see a
  9044	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcrust of metallic deposit all over it. I had stooped and was
  9045	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tscraping at this to see exactly what it was when I heard a
  9046	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmuttered exclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of the
  9047	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcolonel looking down at me.
  9048	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9049	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'What are you doing there?' he asked.
  9050	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9051	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as
  9052	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat which he had told me. 'I was admiring your fuller's-earth,'
  9053	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsaid I; 'I think that I should be better able to advise you as to
  9054	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyour machine if I knew what the exact purpose was for which it
  9055	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas used.'
  9056	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9057	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of
  9058	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmy speech. His face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in
  9059	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this grey eyes.
  9060	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9061	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Very well,' said he, 'you shall know all about the machine.' He
  9062	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttook a step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key
  9063	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin the lock. I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it
  9064	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas quite secure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and
  9065	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshoves. 'Hullo!' I yelled. 'Hullo! Colonel! Let me out!'
  9066	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9067	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my
  9068	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\theart into my mouth. It was the clank of the levers and the swish
  9069	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof the leaking cylinder. He had set the engine at work. The lamp
  9070	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstill stood upon the floor where I had placed it when examining
  9071	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe trough. By its light I saw that the black ceiling was coming
  9072	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdown upon me, slowly, jerkily, but, as none knew better than
  9073	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmyself, with a force which must within a minute grind me to a
  9074	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshapeless pulp. I threw myself, screaming, against the door, and
  9075	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdragged with my nails at the lock. I implored the colonel to let
  9076	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tme out, but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my
  9077	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcries. The ceiling was only a foot or two above my head, and with
  9078	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmy hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface. Then it
  9079	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tflashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend
  9080	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvery much upon the position in which I met it. If I lay on my
  9081	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tface the weight would come upon my spine, and I shuddered to
  9082	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthink of that dreadful snap. Easier the other way, perhaps; and
  9083	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyet, had I the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black
  9084	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshadow wavering down upon me? Already I was unable to stand
  9085	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\terect, when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope
  9086	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tback to my heart.
  9087	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9088	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the
  9089	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twalls were of wood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw
  9090	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta thin line of yellow light between two of the boards, which
  9091	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbroadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward. For
  9092	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tan instant I could hardly believe that here was indeed a door
  9093	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich led away from death. The next instant I threw myself
  9094	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthrough, and lay half-fainting upon the other side. The panel had
  9095	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tclosed again behind me, but the crash of the lamp, and a few
  9096	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmoments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal, told me
  9097	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thow narrow had been my escape.
  9098	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9099	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and
  9100	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor,
  9101	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhile a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand,
  9102	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhile she held a candle in her right. It was the same good friend
  9103	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhose warning I had so foolishly rejected.
  9104	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9105	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Come! come!' she cried breathlessly. 'They will be here in a
  9106	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmoment. They will see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste
  9107	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe so-precious time, but come!'
  9108	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9109	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to
  9110	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmy feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding
  9111	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstair. The latter led to another broad passage, and just as we
  9112	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\treached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of
  9113	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttwo voices, one answering the other from the floor on which  we
  9114	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twere and from the one beneath. My guide stopped and looked about
  9115	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ther like one  who is at her wit's end. Then she threw open a door
  9116	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich led into a bedroom, through the window of which the moon
  9117	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas shining brightly.
  9118	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9119	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'It is your only chance,' said she. 'It is high, but it may be
  9120	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat you can jump it.'
  9121	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9122	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"As she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the
  9123	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpassage, and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark
  9124	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a
  9125	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbutcher's cleaver in the other. I rushed across the bedroom,
  9126	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tflung open the window, and looked out. How quiet and sweet and
  9127	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twholesome the garden looked in the moonlight, and it could not be
  9128	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmore than thirty feet down. I clambered out upon the sill, but I
  9129	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thesitated to jump until I should have heard what passed between
  9130	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmy saviour and the ruffian who pursued me. If she were ill-used,
  9131	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthen at any risks I was determined to go back to her assistance.
  9132	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at
  9133	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe door, pushing his way past her; but she threw her arms round
  9134	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thim and tried to hold him back.
  9135	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9136	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Fritz! Fritz!' she cried in English, 'remember your promise
  9137	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tafter the last time. You said it should not be again. He will be
  9138	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsilent! Oh, he will be silent!'
  9139	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9140	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'You are mad, Elise!' he shouted, struggling to break away from
  9141	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ther. 'You will be the ruin of us. He has seen too much. Let me
  9142	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpass, I say!' He dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the
  9143	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twindow, cut at me with his heavy weapon. I had let myself go, and
  9144	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas hanging by the hands to the sill, when his blow fell. I was
  9145	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tconscious of a dull pain, my grip loosened, and I fell into the
  9146	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgarden below.
  9147	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9148	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and
  9149	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I
  9150	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tunderstood that I was far from being out of danger yet. Suddenly,
  9151	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thowever, as I ran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me.
  9152	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI glanced down at my hand, which was throbbing painfully, and
  9153	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthen, for the first time, saw that my thumb had been cut off and
  9154	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat the blood was pouring from my wound. I endeavoured to tie my
  9155	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thandkerchief round it, but there came a sudden buzzing in my
  9156	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among the
  9157	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trose-bushes.
  9158	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9159	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell. It must have been
  9160	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta very long time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was
  9161	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbreaking when I came to myself. My clothes were all sodden with
  9162	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdew, and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded
  9163	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthumb. The smarting of it recalled in an instant all the
  9164	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tparticulars of my night's adventure, and I sprang to my feet with
  9165	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe feeling that I might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers. But
  9166	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto my astonishment, when I came to look round me, neither house
  9167	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnor garden were to be seen. I had been lying in an angle of the
  9168	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thedge close by the highroad, and just a little lower down was a
  9169	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlong building, which proved, upon my approaching it, to be the
  9170	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvery station at which I had arrived upon the previous night. Were
  9171	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed
  9172	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tduring those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.
  9173	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9174	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Half dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning
  9175	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttrain. There would be one to Reading in less than an hour. The
  9176	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsame porter was on duty, I found, as had been there when I
  9177	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tarrived. I inquired of him whether he had ever heard of Colonel
  9178	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tLysander Stark. The name was strange to him. Had he observed a
  9179	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcarriage the night before waiting for me? No, he had not. Was
  9180	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthere a police-station anywhere near? There was one about three
  9181	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmiles off.
  9182	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9183	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined
  9184	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto wait until I got back to town before telling my story to the
  9185	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpolice. It was a little past six when I arrived, so I went first
  9186	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto have my wound dressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to
  9187	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbring me along here. I put the case into your hands and shall do
  9188	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\texactly what you advise."
  9189	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9190	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWe both sat in silence for some little time after listening to
  9191	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthis extraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down
  9192	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfrom the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he
  9193	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tplaced his cuttings.
  9194	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9195	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Here is an advertisement which will interest you," said he. "It
  9196	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tappeared in all the papers about a year ago. Listen to this:
  9197	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t'Lost, on the 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged
  9198	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttwenty-six, a hydraulic engineer. Left his lodgings at ten
  9199	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\to'clock at night, and has not been heard of since. Was
  9200	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdressed in,' etc., etc. Ha! That represents the last time that
  9201	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, I fancy."
  9202	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9203	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Good heavens!" cried my patient. "Then that explains what the
  9204	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgirl said."
  9205	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9206	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Undoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and
  9207	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdesperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should
  9208	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstand in the way of his little game, like those out-and-out
  9209	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship. Well,
  9210	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tevery moment now is precious, so if you feel equal to it we shall
  9211	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgo down to Scotland Yard at once as a preliminary to starting for
  9212	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tEyford."
  9213	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9214	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSome three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train
  9215	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttogether, bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village.
  9216	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThere were Sherlock Holmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector
  9217	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tBradstreet, of Scotland Yard, a plain-clothes man, and myself.
  9218	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tBradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the
  9219	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tseat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with Eyford
  9220	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfor its centre.
  9221	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9222	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"There you are," said he. "That circle is drawn at a radius of
  9223	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tten miles from the village. The place we want must be somewhere
  9224	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnear that line. You said ten miles, I think, sir."
  9225	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9226	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It was an hour's good drive."
  9227	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9228	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And you think that they brought you back all that way when you
  9229	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twere unconscious?"
  9230	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9231	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"They must have done so. I have a confused memory, too, of having
  9232	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbeen lifted and conveyed somewhere."
  9233	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9234	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What I cannot understand," said I, "is why they should have
  9235	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tspared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden.
  9236	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tPerhaps the villain was softened by the woman's entreaties."
  9237	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9238	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face
  9239	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin my life."
  9240	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9241	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Oh, we shall soon clear up all that," said Bradstreet. "Well, I
  9242	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave drawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon
  9243	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit the folk that we are in search of are to be found."
  9244	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9245	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I think I could lay my finger on it," said Holmes quietly.
  9246	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9247	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Really, now!" cried the inspector, "you have formed your
  9248	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\topinion! Come, now, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it is
  9249	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsouth, for the country is more deserted there."
  9250	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9251	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And I say east," said my patient.
  9252	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9253	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I am for west," remarked the plain-clothes man. "There are
  9254	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tseveral quiet little villages up there."
  9255	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9256	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And I am for north," said I, "because there are no hills there,
  9257	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up
  9258	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tany."
  9259	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9260	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Come," cried the inspector, laughing; "it's a very pretty
  9261	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdiversity of opinion. We have boxed the compass among us. Who do
  9262	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyou give your casting vote to?"
  9263	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9264	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You are all wrong."
  9265	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9266	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But we can't all be."
  9267	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9268	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Oh, yes, you can. This is my point." He placed his finger in the
  9269	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcentre of the circle. "This is where we shall find them."
  9270	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9271	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But the twelve-mile drive?" gasped Hatherley.
  9272	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9273	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Six out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that the
  9274	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thorse was fresh and glossy when you got in. How could it be that
  9275	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tif it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads?"
  9276	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9277	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough," observed Bradstreet
  9278	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthoughtfully. "Of course there can be no doubt as to the nature
  9279	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof this gang."
  9280	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9281	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"None at all," said Holmes. "They are coiners on a large scale,
  9282	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the
  9283	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tplace of silver."
  9284	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9285	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,"
  9286	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsaid the inspector. "They have been turning out half-crowns by
  9287	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe thousand. We even traced them as far as Reading, but could
  9288	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tget no farther, for they had covered their traces in a way that
  9289	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshowed that they were very old hands. But now, thanks to this
  9290	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlucky chance, I think that we have got them right enough."
  9291	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9292	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tBut the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not
  9293	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdestined to fall into the hands of justice. As we rolled into
  9294	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tEyford Station we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed
  9295	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tup from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood and
  9296	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape.
  9297	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9298	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"A house on fire?" asked Bradstreet as the train steamed off
  9299	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tagain on its way.
  9300	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9301	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, sir!" said the station-master.

  9303	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"When did it break out?"
  9304	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9305	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse,
  9306	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand the whole place is in a blaze."
  9307	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9308	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Whose house is it?"
  9309	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9310	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Dr. Becher's."
  9311	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9312	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Tell me," broke in the engineer, "is Dr. Becher a German, very
  9313	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthin, with a long, sharp nose?"
  9314	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9315	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe station-master laughed heartily. "No, sir, Dr. Becher is an
  9316	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tEnglishman, and there isn't a man in the parish who has a
  9317	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbetter-lined waistcoat. But he has a gentleman staying with him,
  9318	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta patient, as I understand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as
  9319	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tif a little good Berkshire beef would do him no harm."
  9320	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9321	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe station-master had not finished his speech before we were all
  9322	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thastening in the direction of the fire. The road topped a low
  9323	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thill, and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in
  9324	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfront of us, spouting fire at every chink and window, while in
  9325	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe garden in front three fire-engines were vainly striving to
  9326	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tkeep the flames under.
  9327	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9328	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"That's it!" cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. "There is
  9329	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay. That
  9330	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsecond window is the one that I jumped from."
  9331	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9332	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, at least," said Holmes, "you have had your revenge upon
  9333	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthem. There can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which,
  9334	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhen it was crushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls,
  9335	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthough no doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to
  9336	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tobserve it at the time. Now keep your eyes open in this crowd for
  9337	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyour friends of last night, though I very much fear that they are
  9338	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta good hundred miles off by now."
  9339	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9340	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tAnd Holmes' fears came to be realised, for from that day to this
  9341	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tno word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the
  9342	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsinister German, or the morose Englishman. Early that morning a
  9343	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpeasant had met a cart containing several people and some very
  9344	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of Reading, but
  9345	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthere all traces of the fugitives disappeared, and even Holmes'
  9346	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their
  9347	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhereabouts.
  9348	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9349	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements
  9350	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich they had found within, and still more so by discovering a
  9351	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnewly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor.
  9352	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tAbout sunset, however, their efforts were at last successful, and
  9353	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthey subdued the flames, but not before the roof had fallen in,
  9354	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that, save
  9355	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsome twisted cylinders and iron piping, not a trace remained of
  9356	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so
  9357	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdearly. Large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered stored
  9358	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin an out-house, but no coins were to be found, which may have
  9359	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\texplained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been
  9360	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\talready referred to.
  9361	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9362	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHow our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to
  9363	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe spot where he recovered his senses might have remained
  9364	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tforever a mystery were it not for the soft mould, which told us a
  9365	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvery plain tale. He had evidently been carried down by two
  9366	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpersons, one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other
  9367	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tunusually large ones. On the whole, it was most probable that the
  9368	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsilent Englishman, being less bold or less murderous than his
  9369	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcompanion, had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out
  9370	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof the way of danger.
  9371	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9372	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well," said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return
  9373	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tonce more to London, "it has been a pretty business for me! I
  9374	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave lost my thumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what
  9375	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave I gained?"
  9376	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9377	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Experience," said Holmes, laughing. "Indirectly it may be of
  9378	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvalue, you know; you have only to put it into words to gain the
  9379	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\treputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your
  9380	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\texistence."
  9381	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9382	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9383	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9384	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tX. THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR
  9385	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9386	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe Lord St. Simon marriage, and its curious termination, have
  9387	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlong ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles
  9388	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin which the unfortunate bridegroom moves. Fresh scandals have
  9389	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\teclipsed it, and their more piquant details have drawn the
  9390	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgossips away from this four-year-old drama. As I have reason to
  9391	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbelieve, however, that the full facts have never been revealed to
  9392	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe general public, and as my friend Sherlock Holmes had a
  9393	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tconsiderable share in clearing the matter up, I feel that no
  9394	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmemoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of
  9395	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthis remarkable episode.
  9396	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9397	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tIt was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I
  9398	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came
  9399	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thome from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table
  9400	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twaiting for him. I had remained indoors all day, for the weather
  9401	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thad taken a sudden turn to rain, with high autumnal winds, and
  9402	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe Jezail bullet which I had brought back in one of my limbs as
  9403	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta relic of my Afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence.
  9404	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWith my body in one easy-chair and my legs upon another, I had
  9405	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsurrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last,
  9406	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsaturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all aside and
  9407	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the
  9408	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tenvelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend's
  9409	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnoble correspondent could be.
  9410	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9411	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Here is a very fashionable epistle," I remarked as he entered.
  9412	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Your morning letters, if I remember right, were from a
  9413	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfish-monger and a tide-waiter."
  9414	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9415	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety," he
  9416	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tanswered, smiling, "and the humbler are usually the more
  9417	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinteresting. This looks like one of those unwelcome social
  9418	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsummonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie."
  9419	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9420	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHe broke the seal and glanced over the contents.
  9421	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9422	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Oh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after all."
  9423	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9424	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Not social, then?"
  9425	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9426	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No, distinctly professional."
  9427	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9428	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And from a noble client?"
  9429	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9430	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"One of the highest in England."
  9431	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9432	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"My dear fellow, I congratulate you."
  9433	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9434	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my
  9435	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tclient is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his
  9436	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcase. It is just possible, however, that that also may not be
  9437	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twanting in this new investigation. You have been reading the
  9438	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpapers diligently of late, have you not?"
  9439	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9440	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It looks like it," said I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in
  9441	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe corner. "I have had nothing else to do."
  9442	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9443	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I
  9444	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tread nothing except the criminal news and the agony column. The
  9445	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlatter is always instructive. But if you have followed recent
  9446	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tevents so closely you must have read about Lord St. Simon and his
  9447	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twedding?"
  9448	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9449	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Oh, yes, with the deepest interest."
  9450	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9451	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"That is well. The letter which I hold in my hand is from Lord

  9458	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave determined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you
  9459	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin reference to the very painful event which has occurred in

  9461	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tacting already in the matter, but he assures me that he sees no
  9462	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tobjection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that
  9463	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit might be of some assistance. I will call at four o'clock in

  9542	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twould be at St. George's, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen
  9543	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tintimate friends would be invited, and that the party would
  9544	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\treturn to the furnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been
  9545	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttaken by Mr. Aloysius Doran. Two days later--that is, on
  9546	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWednesday last--there is a curt announcement that the wedding had
  9547	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttaken place, and that the honeymoon would be passed at Lord
  9548	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tBackwater's place, near Petersfield. Those are all the notices
  9549	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich appeared before the disappearance of the bride."
  9550	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9551	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Before the what?" asked Holmes with a start.
  9552	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9553	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The vanishing of the lady."
  9554	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9555	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"When did she vanish, then?"
  9556	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9557	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"At the wedding breakfast."
  9558	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9559	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Indeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite
  9560	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdramatic, in fact."
  9561	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9562	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common."
  9563	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9564	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"They often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during
  9565	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe honeymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt
  9566	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tas this. Pray let me have the details."
  9567	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9568	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I warn you that they are very incomplete."
  9569	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9570	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Perhaps we may make them less so."
  9571	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9572	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Such as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a
  9573	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmorning paper of yesterday, which I will read to you. It is
  9574	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\theaded, 'Singular Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding':
  9575	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9576	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into the
  9577	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgreatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which
  9578	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave taken place in connection with his wedding. The ceremony, as
  9579	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshortly announced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the
  9580	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tprevious morning; but it is only now that it has been possible to
  9581	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tconfirm the strange rumours which have been so persistently
  9582	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfloating about. In spite of the attempts of the friends to hush
  9583	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe matter up, so much public attention has now been drawn to it
  9584	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what
  9585	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tis a common subject for conversation.
  9586	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9587	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'The ceremony, which was performed at St. George's, Hanover
  9588	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSquare, was a very quiet one, no one being present save the
  9589	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfather of the bride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral,
  9590	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tLord Backwater, Lord Eustace and Lady Clara St. Simon (the
  9591	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyounger brother and sister of the bridegroom), and Lady Alicia
  9592	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWhittington. The whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of
  9593	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tMr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster Gate, where breakfast had been
  9594	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tprepared. It appears that some little trouble was caused by a
  9595	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twoman, whose name has not been ascertained, who endeavoured to
  9596	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tforce her way into the house after the bridal party, alleging
  9597	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon. It was only after a
  9598	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpainful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler
  9599	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand the footman. The bride, who had fortunately entered the house
  9600	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbefore this unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast
  9601	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twith the rest, when she complained of a sudden indisposition and
  9602	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tretired to her room. Her prolonged absence having caused some
  9603	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcomment, her father followed her, but learned from her maid that
  9604	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshe had only come up to her chamber for an instant, caught up an
  9605	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the passage. One of the
  9606	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfootmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus
  9607	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tapparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his mistress,
  9608	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbelieving her to be with the company. On ascertaining that his
  9609	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdaughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in conjunction with
  9610	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication with
  9611	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe police, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which
  9612	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twill probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very
  9613	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsingular business. Up to a late hour last night, however, nothing
  9614	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thad transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady. There
  9615	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tare rumours of foul play in the matter, and it is said that the
  9616	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpolice have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the
  9617	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\toriginal disturbance, in the belief that, from jealousy or some
  9618	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tother motive, she may have been concerned in the strange
  9619	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdisappearance of the bride.'"
  9620	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9621	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And is that all?"
  9622	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9623	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is
  9624	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta suggestive one."
  9625	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9626	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And it is--"
  9627	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9628	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"That Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance,
  9629	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thas actually been arrested. It appears that she was formerly a
  9630	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdanseuse at the Allegro, and that she has known the bridegroom
  9631	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfor some years. There are no further particulars, and the whole
  9632	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcase is in your hands now--so far as it has been set forth in the
  9633	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpublic press."
  9634	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9635	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. I would
  9636	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnot have missed it for worlds. But there is a ring at the bell,
  9637	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWatson, and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four, I
  9638	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client. Do not
  9639	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdream of going, Watson, for I very much prefer having a witness,
  9640	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tif only as a check to my own memory."
  9641	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9642	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Lord Robert St. Simon," announced our page-boy, throwing open
  9643	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe door. A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face,
  9644	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thigh-nosed and pale, with something perhaps of petulance about
  9645	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe mouth, and with the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose
  9646	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed. His
  9647	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmanner was brisk, and yet his general appearance gave an undue
  9648	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\timpression of age, for he had a slight forward stoop and a little
  9649	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbend of the knees as he walked. His hair, too, as he swept off
  9650	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the edges and thin
  9651	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tupon the top. As to his dress, it was careful to the verge of
  9652	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfoppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white waistcoat,
  9653	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured gaiters.
  9654	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHe advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left to
  9655	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tright, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his
  9656	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgolden eyeglasses.
  9657	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9658	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Good-day, Lord St. Simon," said Holmes, rising and bowing. "Pray
  9659	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttake the basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr.
  9660	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWatson. Draw up a little to the fire, and we will talk this
  9661	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmatter over."
  9662	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9663	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine,
  9664	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tMr. Holmes. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you
  9665	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir,
  9666	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthough I presume that they were hardly from the same class of
  9667	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsociety."
  9668	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9669	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No, I am descending."
  9670	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9671	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I beg pardon."
  9672	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9673	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"My last client of the sort was a king."
  9674	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9675	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Oh, really! I had no idea. And which king?"
  9676	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9677	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The King of Scandinavia."
  9678	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9679	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What! Had he lost his wife?"
  9680	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9681	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You can understand," said Holmes suavely, "that I extend to the
  9682	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\taffairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to
  9683	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyou in yours."
  9684	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9685	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Of course! Very right! very right! I'm sure I beg pardon. As to
  9686	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmy own case, I am ready to give you any information which may
  9687	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tassist you in forming an opinion."
  9688	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9689	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Thank you. I have already learned all that is in the public
  9690	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tprints, nothing more. I presume that I may take it as correct--this
  9691	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tarticle, for example, as to the disappearance of the bride."
  9692	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9693	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tLord St. Simon glanced over it. "Yes, it is correct, as far as it
  9694	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgoes."
  9695	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9696	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could
  9697	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\toffer an opinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most
  9698	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdirectly by questioning you."
  9699	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9700	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Pray do so."
  9701	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9702	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?"
  9703	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9704	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"In San Francisco, a year ago."
  9705	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9706	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You were travelling in the States?"
  9707	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9708	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes."
  9709	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9710	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Did you become engaged then?"
  9711	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9712	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No."
  9713	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9714	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But you were on a friendly footing?"
  9715	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9716	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I was amused by her society, and she could see that I was
  9717	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tamused."
  9718	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9719	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Her father is very rich?"
  9720	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9721	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"He is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope."
  9722	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9723	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And how did he make his money?"
  9724	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9725	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"In mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold,
  9726	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinvested it, and came up by leaps and bounds."
  9727	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9728	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady's--your
  9729	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twife's character?"
  9730	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9731	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down
  9732	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinto the fire. "You see, Mr. Holmes," said he, "my wife was
  9733	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttwenty before her father became a rich man. During that time she
  9734	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods or
  9735	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmountains, so that her education has come from Nature rather than
  9736	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfrom the schoolmaster. She is what we call in England a tomboy,
  9737	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twith a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by any sort of
  9738	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttraditions. She is impetuous--volcanic, I was about to say. She
  9739	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tis swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her
  9740	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tresolutions. On the other hand, I would not have given her the
  9741	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tname which I have the honour to bear"--he gave a little stately
  9742	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcough--"had not I thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. I
  9743	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbelieve that she is capable of heroic self-sacrifice and that
  9744	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tanything dishonourable would be repugnant to her."
  9745	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9746	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Have you her photograph?"
  9747	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9748	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I brought this with me." He opened a locket and showed us the
  9749	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfull face of a very lovely woman. It was not a photograph but an
  9750	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tivory miniature, and the artist had brought out the full effect
  9751	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof the lustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the
  9752	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\texquisite mouth. Holmes gazed long and earnestly at it. Then he
  9753	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tclosed the locket and handed it back to Lord St. Simon.
  9754	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9755	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your
  9756	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tacquaintance?"
  9757	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9758	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, her father brought her over for this last London season. I
  9759	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmet her several times, became engaged to her, and have now
  9760	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmarried her."
  9761	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9762	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?"
  9763	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9764	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"A fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family."
  9765	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9766	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a
  9767	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfait accompli?"
  9768	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9769	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I really have made no inquiries on the subject."
  9770	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9771	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Very naturally not. Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the
  9772	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twedding?"
  9773	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9774	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes."
  9775	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9776	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Was she in good spirits?"
  9777	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9778	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Never better. She kept talking of what we should do in our
  9779	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfuture lives."
  9780	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9781	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Indeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the
  9782	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twedding?"
  9783	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9784	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"She was as bright as possible--at least until after the
  9785	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tceremony."
  9786	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9787	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And did you observe any change in her then?"

  9789	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had
  9790	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tever seen that her temper was just a little sharp. The incident
  9791	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thowever, was too trivial to relate and can have no possible
  9792	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbearing upon the case."
  9793	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9794	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Pray let us have it, for all that."
  9795	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9796	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Oh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards
  9797	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe vestry. She was passing the front pew at the time, and it
  9798	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfell over into the pew. There was a moment's delay, but the
  9799	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgentleman in the pew handed it up to her again, and it did not
  9800	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tappear to be the worse for the fall. Yet when I spoke to her of
  9801	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe matter, she answered me abruptly; and in the carriage, on our
  9802	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tway home, she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause."
  9803	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9804	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Indeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of
  9805	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe general public were present, then?"
  9806	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9807	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Oh, yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is
  9808	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\topen."
  9809	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9810	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"This gentleman was not one of your wife's friends?"
  9811	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9812	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a
  9813	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcommon-looking person. I hardly noticed his appearance. But
  9814	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\treally I think that we are wandering rather far from the point."
  9815	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9816	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Lady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less
  9817	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it. What did she do
  9818	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ton re-entering her father's house?"
  9819	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9820	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I saw her in conversation with her maid."
  9821	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9822	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And who is her maid?"
  9823	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9824	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Alice is her name. She is an American and came from California
  9825	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twith her."
  9826	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9827	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"A confidential servant?"
  9828	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9829	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"A little too much so. It seemed to me that her mistress allowed
  9830	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ther to take great liberties. Still, of course, in America they
  9831	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlook upon these things in a different way."
  9832	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9833	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"How long did she speak to this Alice?"
  9834	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9835	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Oh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of."
  9836	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9837	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You did not overhear what they said?"
  9838	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9839	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Lady St. Simon said something about 'jumping a claim.' She was
  9840	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\taccustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idea what she
  9841	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmeant."
  9842	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9843	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"American slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your
  9844	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twife do when she finished speaking to her maid?"
  9845	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9846	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"She walked into the breakfast-room."
  9847	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9848	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"On your arm?"
  9849	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9850	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that.
  9851	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThen, after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose
  9852	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thurriedly, muttered some words of apology, and left the room. She
  9853	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnever came back."
  9854	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9855	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to
  9856	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ther room, covered her bride's dress with a long ulster, put on a
  9857	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbonnet, and went out."
  9858	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9859	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Quite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in
  9860	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcompany with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who
  9861	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thad already made a disturbance at Mr. Doran's house that
  9862	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmorning."
  9863	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9864	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Ah, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lady,
  9865	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand your relations to her."
  9866	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9867	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tLord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows.
  9868	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"We have been on a friendly footing for some years--I may say on
  9869	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta very friendly footing. She used to be at the Allegro. I have
  9870	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnot treated her ungenerously, and she had no just cause of
  9871	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcomplaint against me, but you know what women are, Mr. Holmes.
  9872	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tFlora was a dear little thing, but exceedingly hot-headed and
  9873	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdevotedly attached to me. She wrote me dreadful letters when she
  9874	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\theard that I was about to be married, and, to tell the truth, the
  9875	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\treason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that I
  9876	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfeared lest there might be a scandal in the church. She came to
  9877	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tMr. Doran's door just after we returned, and she endeavoured to
  9878	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpush her way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my
  9879	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twife, and even threatening her, but I had foreseen the
  9880	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpossibility of something of the sort, and I had two police
  9881	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfellows there in private clothes, who soon pushed her out again.
  9882	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tShe was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a
  9883	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trow."
  9884	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9885	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Did your wife hear all this?"
  9886	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9887	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No, thank goodness, she did not."
  9888	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9889	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?"
  9890	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9891	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as
  9892	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tso serious. It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out and laid
  9893	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsome terrible trap for her."
  9894	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9895	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, it is a possible supposition."
  9896	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9897	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You think so, too?"
  9898	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9899	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon
  9900	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthis as likely?"
  9901	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9902	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I do not think Flora would hurt a fly."
  9903	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9904	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray
  9905	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhat is your own theory as to what took place?"
  9906	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9907	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I
  9908	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave given you all the facts. Since you ask me, however, I may
  9909	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsay that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of
  9910	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthis affair, the consciousness that she had made so immense a
  9911	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsocial stride, had the effect of causing some little nervous
  9912	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdisturbance in my wife."
  9913	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9914	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?"
  9915	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9916	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, really, when I consider that she has turned her back--I
  9917	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twill not say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to
  9918	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twithout success--I can hardly explain it in any other fashion."
  9919	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9920	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis," said
  9921	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHolmes, smiling. "And now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I have
  9922	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnearly all my data. May I ask whether you were seated at the
  9923	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbreakfast-table so that you could see out of the window?"
  9924	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9925	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"We could see the other side of the road and the Park."
  9926	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9927	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Quite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer.
  9928	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI shall communicate with you."
  9929	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9930	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem," said our
  9931	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tclient, rising.
  9932	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9933	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I have solved it."
  9934	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9935	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Eh? What was that?"
  9936	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9937	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I say that I have solved it."
  9938	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9939	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Where, then, is my wife?"
  9940	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9941	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"That is a detail which I shall speedily supply."
  9942	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9943	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tLord St. Simon shook his head. "I am afraid that it will take
  9944	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twiser heads than yours or mine," he remarked, and bowing in a
  9945	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstately, old-fashioned manner he departed.
  9946	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9947	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It is very good of Lord St. Simon to honour my head by putting
  9948	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit on a level with his own," said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. "I
  9949	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthink that I shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all
  9950	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthis cross-questioning. I had formed my conclusions as to the
  9951	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcase before our client came into the room."
  9952	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9953	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"My dear Holmes!"
  9954	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9955	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I
  9956	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tremarked before, which were quite as prompt. My whole examination
  9957	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tserved to turn my conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial
  9958	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tevidence is occasionally very convincing, as when you find a
  9959	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttrout in the milk, to quote Thoreau's example."
  9960	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9961	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But I have heard all that you have heard."
  9962	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9963	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Without, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which
  9964	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tserves me so well. There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some
  9965	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyears back, and something on very much the same lines at Munich
  9966	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe year after the Franco-Prussian War. It is one of these
  9967	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcases--but, hullo, here is Lestrade! Good-afternoon, Lestrade!
  9968	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tYou will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard, and there are
  9969	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcigars in the box."
  9970	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9971	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat,
  9972	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a
  9973	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tblack canvas bag in his hand. With a short greeting he seated
  9974	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thimself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him.
  9975	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9976	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What's up, then?" asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye. "You
  9977	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlook dissatisfied."
  9978	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9979	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage
  9980	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcase. I can make neither head nor tail of the business."
  9981	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9982	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Really! You surprise me."
  9983	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9984	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Who ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slip
  9985	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthrough my fingers. I have been at work upon it all day."
  9986	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9987	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And very wet it seems to have made you," said Holmes laying his
  9988	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thand upon the arm of the pea-jacket.
  9989	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9990	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, I have been dragging the Serpentine."
  9991	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9992	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"In heaven's name, what for?"
  9993	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9994	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"In search of the body of Lady St. Simon."
  9995	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9996	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.
  9997	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
  9998	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?" he
  9999	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tasked.
 10000	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10001	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Why? What do you mean?"
 10002	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10003	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in
 10004	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe one as in the other."
 10005	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10006	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tLestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. "I suppose you
 10007	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tknow all about it," he snarled.
 10008	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10009	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up."
 10010	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10011	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Oh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in
 10012	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe matter?"
 10013	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10014	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I think it very unlikely."
 10015	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10016	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found
 10017	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthis in it?" He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the
 10018	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfloor a wedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin
 10019	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshoes and a bride's wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked
 10020	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin water. "There," said he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the
 10021	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttop of the pile. "There is a little nut for you to crack, Master
 10022	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHolmes."
 10023	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10024	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Oh, indeed!" said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air.
 10025	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You dragged them from the Serpentine?"
 10026	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10027	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No. They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper.
 10028	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThey have been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me
 10029	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat if the clothes were there the body would not be far off."
 10030	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10031	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"By the same brilliant reasoning, every man's body is to be found

 10034	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10035	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"At some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance."
 10036	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10037	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I am afraid that you will find it difficult."
 10038	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10039	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Are you, indeed, now?" cried Lestrade with some bitterness. "I
 10040	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tam afraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your
 10041	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdeductions and your inferences. You have made two blunders in as
 10042	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmany minutes. This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar."
 10043	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10044	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And how?"
 10045	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10046	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"In the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the
 10047	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcard-case is a note. And here is the very note." He slapped it
 10048	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdown upon the table in front of him. "Listen to this: 'You will
 10049	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsee me when all is ready. Come at once. F.H.M.' Now my theory all
 10050	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\talong has been that Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora
 10051	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tMillar, and that she, with confederates, no doubt, was
 10052	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tresponsible for her disappearance. Here, signed with her
 10053	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinitials, is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped
 10054	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinto her hand at the door and which lured her within their
 10055	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\treach."
 10056	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10057	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Very good, Lestrade," said Holmes, laughing. "You really are
 10058	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvery fine indeed. Let me see it." He took up the paper in a
 10059	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlistless way, but his attention instantly became riveted, and he
 10060	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgave a little cry of satisfaction. "This is indeed important,"
 10061	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsaid he.
 10062	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10063	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Ha! you find it so?"
 10064	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10065	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Extremely so. I congratulate you warmly."
 10066	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10067	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tLestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. "Why," he
 10068	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshrieked, "you're looking at the wrong side!"
 10069	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10070	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"On the contrary, this is the right side."
 10071	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10072	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The right side? You're mad! Here is the note written in pencil
 10073	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tover here."
 10074	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10075	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel
 10076	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbill, which interests me deeply."
 10077	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10078	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"There's nothing in it. I looked at it before," said Lestrade.
 10079	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Oct. 4th, rooms 8s., breakfast 2s. 6d., cocktail 1s., lunch 2s.
 10080	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t6d., glass sherry, 8d.' I see nothing in that."
 10081	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10082	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Very likely not. It is most important, all the same. As to the
 10083	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnote, it is important also, or at least the initials are, so I
 10084	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcongratulate you again."
 10085	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10086	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I've wasted time enough," said Lestrade, rising. "I believe in
 10087	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories.
 10088	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tGood-day, Mr. Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom
 10089	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof the matter first." He gathered up the garments, thrust them
 10090	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinto the bag, and made for the door.
 10091	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10092	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Just one hint to you, Lestrade," drawled Holmes before his rival
 10093	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvanished; "I will tell you the true solution of the matter. Lady
 10094	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSt. Simon is a myth. There is not, and there never has been, any
 10095	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsuch person."
 10096	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10097	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tLestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me,
 10098	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttapped his forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and
 10099	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thurried away.
 10100	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10101	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHe had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on
 10102	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this overcoat. "There is something in what the fellow says about
 10103	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\toutdoor work," he remarked, "so I think, Watson, that I must
 10104	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tleave you to your papers for a little."
 10105	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10106	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tIt was after five o'clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had
 10107	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tno time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a
 10108	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tconfectioner's man with a very large flat box. This he unpacked
 10109	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twith the help of a youth whom he had brought with him, and
 10110	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpresently, to my very great astonishment, a quite epicurean
 10111	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlittle cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble
 10112	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlodging-house mahogany. There were a couple of brace of cold
 10113	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twoodcock, a pheasant, a pÃ¢tÃ© de foie gras pie with a group of
 10114	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tancient and cobwebby bottles. Having laid out all these luxuries,
 10115	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmy two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian
 10116	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tNights, with no explanation save that the things had been paid
 10117	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfor and were ordered to this address.
 10118	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10119	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tJust before nine o'clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the
 10120	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\troom. His features were gravely set, but there was a light in his
 10121	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\teye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his
 10122	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tconclusions.
 10123	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10124	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"They have laid the supper, then," he said, rubbing his hands.
 10125	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10126	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You seem to expect company. They have laid for five."
 10127	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10128	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in," said he. "I
 10129	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tam surprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I
 10130	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfancy that I hear his step now upon the stairs."
 10131	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10132	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tIt was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in,
 10133	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdangling his glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very
 10134	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tperturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.
 10135	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10136	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"My messenger reached you, then?" asked Holmes.
 10137	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10138	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure.
 10139	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHave you good authority for what you say?"
 10140	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10141	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The best possible."
 10142	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10143	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tLord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his
 10144	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tforehead.
 10145	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10146	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What will the Duke say," he murmured, "when he hears that one of
 10147	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe family has been subjected to such humiliation?"
 10148	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10149	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any
 10150	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thumiliation."
 10151	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10152	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Ah, you look on these things from another standpoint."
 10153	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10154	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I fail to see that anyone is to blame. I can hardly see how the
 10155	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlady could have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of
 10156	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdoing it was undoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she
 10157	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thad no one to advise her at such a crisis."
 10158	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10159	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It was a slight, sir, a public slight," said Lord St. Simon,
 10160	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttapping his fingers upon the table.
 10161	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10162	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so
 10163	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tunprecedented a position."
 10164	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10165	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have
 10166	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbeen shamefully used."
 10167	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10168	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I think that I heard a ring," said Holmes. "Yes, there are steps
 10169	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ton the landing. If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view
 10170	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof the matter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advocate here
 10171	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twho may be more successful." He opened the door and ushered in a
 10172	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlady and gentleman. "Lord St. Simon," said he "allow me to
 10173	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tintroduce you to Mr. and Mrs. Francis Hay Moulton. The lady, I
 10174	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthink, you have already met."
 10175	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10176	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tAt the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his
 10177	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tseat and stood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand
 10178	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthrust into the breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended
 10179	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdignity. The lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out
 10180	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ther hand to him, but he still refused to raise his eyes. It was
 10181	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tas well for his resolution, perhaps, for her pleading face was
 10182	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tone which it was hard to resist.
 10183	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10184	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You're angry, Robert," said she. "Well, I guess you have every
 10185	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcause to be."
 10186	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10187	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Pray make no apology to me," said Lord St. Simon bitterly.
 10188	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10189	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Oh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that I
 10190	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshould have spoken to you before I went; but I was kind of
 10191	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trattled, and from the time when I saw Frank here again I just
 10192	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdidn't know what I was doing or saying. I only wonder I didn't
 10193	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfall down and do a faint right there before the altar."
 10194	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10195	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Perhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave
 10196	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe room while you explain this matter?"
 10197	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10198	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"If I may give an opinion," remarked the strange gentleman,
 10199	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"we've had just a little too much secrecy over this business
 10200	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\talready. For my part, I should like all Europe and America to
 10201	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thear the rights of it." He was a small, wiry, sunburnt man,
 10202	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tclean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert manner.
 10203	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10204	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Then I'll tell our story right away," said the lady. "Frank here
 10205	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand I met in '84, in McQuire's camp, near the Rockies, where pa
 10206	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas working a claim. We were engaged to each other, Frank and I;
 10207	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbut then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile,
 10208	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhile poor Frank here had a claim that petered out and came to
 10209	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnothing. The richer pa grew the poorer was Frank; so at last pa
 10210	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twouldn't hear of our engagement lasting any longer, and he took
 10211	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tme away to 'Frisco. Frank wouldn't throw up his hand, though; so
 10212	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\the followed me there, and he saw me without pa knowing anything
 10213	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tabout it. It would only have made him mad to know, so we just
 10214	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfixed it all up for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and
 10215	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmake his pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had
 10216	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tas much as pa. So then I promised to wait for him to the end of
 10217	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttime and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived.
 10218	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t'Why shouldn't we be married right away, then,' said he, 'and
 10219	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthen I will feel sure of you; and I won't claim to be your
 10220	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thusband until I come back?' Well, we talked it over, and he had
 10221	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman all ready in waiting,
 10222	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat we just did it right there; and then Frank went off to seek
 10223	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this fortune, and I went back to pa.
 10224	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10225	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then
 10226	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\the went prospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New
 10227	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tMexico. After that came a long newspaper story about how a
 10228	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tminers' camp had been attacked by Apache Indians, and there was
 10229	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmy Frank's name among the killed. I fainted dead away, and I was
 10230	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvery sick for months after. Pa thought I had a decline and took
 10231	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tme to half the doctors in 'Frisco. Not a word of news came for a
 10232	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyear and more, so that I never doubted that Frank was really
 10233	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdead. Then Lord St. Simon came to 'Frisco, and we came to London,
 10234	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand a marriage was arranged, and pa was very pleased, but I felt
 10235	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tall the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place
 10236	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.
 10237	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10238	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Still, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I'd have done
 10239	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmy duty by him. We can't command our love, but we can our
 10240	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tactions. I went to the altar with him with the intention to make
 10241	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thim just as good a wife as it was in me to be. But you may
 10242	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\timagine what I felt when, just as I came to the altar rails, I
 10243	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tglanced back and saw Frank standing and looking at me out of the
 10244	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfirst pew. I thought it was his ghost at first; but when I looked
 10245	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tagain there he was still, with a kind of question in his eyes, as
 10246	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tif to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to see him. I wonder I
 10247	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdidn't drop. I know that everything was turning round, and the
 10248	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twords of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my
 10249	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tear. I didn't know what to do. Should I stop the service and make
 10250	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to
 10251	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tknow what I was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to
 10252	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttell me to be still. Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper,
 10253	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand I knew that he was writing me a note. As I passed his pew on
 10254	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe way out I dropped my bouquet over to him, and he slipped the
 10255	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnote into my hand when he returned me the flowers. It was only a
 10256	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tline asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so.
 10257	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tOf course I never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now
 10258	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto him, and I determined to do just whatever he might direct.
 10259	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10260	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California,
 10261	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand had always been his friend. I ordered her to say nothing, but
 10262	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto get a few things packed and my ulster ready. I know I ought to
 10263	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave spoken to Lord St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard before
 10264	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this mother and all those great people. I just made up my mind to
 10265	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trun away and explain afterwards. I hadn't been at the table ten
 10266	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tminutes before I saw Frank out of the window at the other side of
 10267	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe road. He beckoned to me and then began walking into the Park.
 10268	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI slipped out, put on my things, and followed him. Some woman
 10269	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcame talking something or other about Lord St. Simon to
 10270	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tme--seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little
 10271	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsecret of his own before marriage also--but I managed to get away
 10272	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfrom her and soon overtook Frank. We got into a cab together, and
 10273	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\taway we drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and
 10274	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat was my true wedding after all those years of waiting. Frank
 10275	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thad been a prisoner among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to
 10276	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t'Frisco, found that I had given him up for dead and had gone to
 10277	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tEngland, followed me there, and had come upon me at last on the
 10278	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvery morning of my second wedding."
 10279	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10280	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I saw it in a paper," explained the American. "It gave the name
 10281	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand the church but not where the lady lived."
 10282	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10283	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Then we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all
 10284	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfor openness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I
 10285	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshould like to vanish away and never see any of them again--just
 10286	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsending a line to pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It
 10287	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting
 10288	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tround that breakfast-table and waiting for me to come back. So
 10289	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tFrank took my wedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of
 10290	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthem, so that I should not be traced, and dropped them away
 10291	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsomewhere where no one could find them. It is likely that we
 10292	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshould have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this good
 10293	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening, though how
 10294	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\the found us is more than I can think, and he showed us very
 10295	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tclearly and kindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right, and
 10296	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so
 10297	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsecret. Then he offered to give us a chance of talking to Lord
 10298	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSt. Simon alone, and so we came right away round to his rooms at
 10299	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tonce. Now, Robert, you have heard it all, and I am very sorry if
 10300	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI have given you pain, and I hope that you do not think very
 10301	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmeanly of me."
 10302	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10303	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tLord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but
 10304	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thad listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this
 10305	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlong narrative.
 10306	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10307	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Excuse me," he said, "but it is not my custom to discuss my most
 10308	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tintimate personal affairs in this public manner."
 10309	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10310	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Then you won't forgive me? You won't shake hands before I go?"
 10311	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10312	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure." He put out
 10313	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him.
 10314	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10315	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I had hoped," suggested Holmes, "that you would have joined us
 10316	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin a friendly supper."
 10317	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10318	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I think that there you ask a little too much," responded his
 10319	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tLordship. "I may be forced to acquiesce in these recent
 10320	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdevelopments, but I can hardly be expected to make merry over
 10321	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthem. I think that with your permission I will now wish you all a
 10322	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvery good-night." He included us all in a sweeping bow and
 10323	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstalked out of the room.
 10324	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10325	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Then I trust that you at least will honour me with your
 10326	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcompany," said Sherlock Holmes. "It is always a joy to meet an
 10327	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tAmerican, Mr. Moulton, for I am one of those who believe that the
 10328	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfolly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in far-gone
 10329	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyears will not prevent our children from being some day citizens
 10330	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof the same world-wide country under a flag which shall be a
 10331	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tquartering of the Union Jack with the Stars and Stripes."
 10332	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10333	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The case has been an interesting one," remarked Holmes when our
 10334	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvisitors had left us, "because it serves to show very clearly how
 10335	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsimple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight
 10336	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tseems to be almost inexplicable. Nothing could be more natural
 10337	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthan the sequence of events as narrated by this lady, and nothing
 10338	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstranger than the result when viewed, for instance, by Mr.
 10339	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tLestrade of Scotland Yard."
 10340	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10341	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You were not yourself at fault at all, then?"
 10342	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10343	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"From the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that
 10344	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony,
 10345	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of
 10346	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\treturning home. Obviously something had occurred during the
 10347	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmorning, then, to cause her to change her mind. What could that
 10348	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsomething be? She could not have spoken to anyone when she was
 10349	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tout, for she had been in the company of the bridegroom. Had she
 10350	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tseen someone, then? If she had, it must be someone from America
 10351	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbecause she had spent so short a time in this country that she
 10352	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcould hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence
 10353	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tover her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change
 10354	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ther plans so completely. You see we have already arrived, by a
 10355	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tprocess of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an
 10356	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tAmerican. Then who could this American be, and why should he
 10357	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpossess so much influence over her? It might be a lover; it might
 10358	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbe a husband. Her young womanhood had, I knew, been spent in
 10359	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trough scenes and under strange conditions. So far I had got
 10360	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbefore I ever heard Lord St. Simon's narrative. When he told us
 10361	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof a man in a pew, of the change in the bride's manner, of so
 10362	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttransparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a
 10363	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and of her very
 10364	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsignificant allusion to claim-jumping--which in miners' parlance
 10365	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmeans taking possession of that which another person has a prior
 10366	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tclaim to--the whole situation became absolutely clear. She had
 10367	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a
 10368	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tprevious husband--the chances being in favour of the latter."
 10369	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10370	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And how in the world did you find them?"
 10371	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10372	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held
 10373	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinformation in his hands the value of which he did not himself
 10374	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tknow. The initials were, of course, of the highest importance,
 10375	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbut more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had
 10376	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsettled his bill at one of the most select London hotels."
 10377	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10378	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"How did you deduce the select?"
 10379	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10380	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"By the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence
 10381	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfor a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive
 10382	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thotels. There are not many in London which charge at that rate.
 10383	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tIn the second one which I visited in Northumberland Avenue, I
 10384	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlearned by an inspection of the book that Francis H. Moulton, an
 10385	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tAmerican gentleman, had left only the day before, and on looking
 10386	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tover the entries against him, I came upon the very items which I
 10387	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thad seen in the duplicate bill. His letters were to be forwarded
 10388	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto 226 Gordon Square; so thither I travelled, and being fortunate
 10389	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tenough to find the loving couple at home, I ventured to give them
 10390	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsome paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be
 10391	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbetter in every way that they should make their position a little
 10392	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tclearer both to the general public and to Lord St. Simon in
 10393	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tparticular. I invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I
 10394	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmade him keep the appointment."
 10395	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10396	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But with no very good result," I remarked. "His conduct was
 10397	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcertainly not very gracious."
 10398	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10399	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Ah, Watson," said Holmes, smiling, "perhaps you would not be
 10400	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvery gracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and
 10401	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twedding, you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of
 10402	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfortune. I think that we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully
 10403	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in
 10404	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe same position. Draw your chair up and hand me my violin, for
 10405	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe only problem we have still to solve is how to while away
 10406	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthese bleak autumnal evenings."

 10410	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tXI. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET
 10411	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10412	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Holmes," said I as I stood one morning in our bow-window looking
 10413	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdown the street, "here is a madman coming along. It seems rather
 10414	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone."
 10415	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10416	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tMy friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands
 10417	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin the pockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. It
 10418	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas a bright, crisp February morning, and the snow of the day
 10419	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbefore still lay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the
 10420	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twintry sun. Down the centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed
 10421	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinto a brown crumbly band by the traffic, but at either side and
 10422	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ton the heaped-up edges of the foot-paths it still lay as white as
 10423	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhen it fell. The grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped, but
 10424	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas still dangerously slippery, so that there were fewer
 10425	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpassengers than usual. Indeed, from the direction of the
 10426	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tMetropolitan Station no one was coming save the single gentleman
 10427	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.
 10428	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10429	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHe was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a
 10430	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmassive, strongly marked face and a commanding figure. He was
 10431	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdressed in a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining
 10432	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\that, neat brown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-grey trousers. Yet
 10433	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress
 10434	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand features, for he was running hard, with occasional little
 10435	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsprings, such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to
 10436	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tset any tax upon his legs. As he ran he jerked his hands up and
 10437	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdown, waggled his head, and writhed his face into the most
 10438	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\textraordinary contortions.
 10439	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10440	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What on earth can be the matter with him?" I asked. "He is
 10441	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlooking up at the numbers of the houses."
 10442	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10443	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I believe that he is coming here," said Holmes, rubbing his
 10444	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thands.
 10445	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10446	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Here?"
 10447	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10448	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I
 10449	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthink that I recognise the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?" As
 10450	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\the spoke, the man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and
 10451	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the
 10452	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tclanging.
 10453	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10454	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tA few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still
 10455	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in
 10456	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and
 10457	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpity. For a while he could not get his words out, but swayed his
 10458	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbody and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the
 10459	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\textreme limits of his reason. Then, suddenly springing to his
 10460	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfeet, he beat his head against the wall with such force that we
 10461	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tboth rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room.
 10462	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSherlock Holmes pushed him down into the easy-chair and, sitting
 10463	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbeside him, patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy,
 10464	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsoothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.
 10465	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10466	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You have come to me to tell your story, have you not?" said he.
 10467	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You are fatigued with your haste. Pray wait until you have
 10468	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trecovered yourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into
 10469	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tany little problem which you may submit to me."
 10470	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10471	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting
 10472	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tagainst his emotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his
 10473	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbrow, set his lips tight, and turned his face towards us.
 10474	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10475	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No doubt you think me mad?" said he.
 10476	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10477	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I see that you have had some great trouble," responded Holmes.
 10478	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10479	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"God knows I have!--a trouble which is enough to unseat my
 10480	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\treason, so sudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might
 10481	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave faced, although I am a man whose character has never yet
 10482	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tborne a stain. Private affliction also is the lot of every man;
 10483	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbut the two coming together, and in so frightful a form, have
 10484	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbeen enough to shake my very soul. Besides, it is not I alone.
 10485	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found
 10486	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tout of this horrible affair."
 10487	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10488	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Pray compose yourself, sir," said Holmes, "and let me have a
 10489	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tclear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen

 10492	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"My name," answered our visitor, "is probably familiar to your
 10493	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tears. I am Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder &
 10494	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tStevenson, of Threadneedle Street."
 10495	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10496	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior
 10497	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpartner in the second largest private banking concern in the City
 10498	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof London. What could have happened, then, to bring one of the
 10499	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tforemost citizens of London to this most pitiable pass? We
 10500	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twaited, all curiosity, until with another effort he braced
 10501	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thimself to tell his story.
 10502	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10503	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I feel that time is of value," said he; "that is why I hastened

 10506	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thurried from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this

 10601	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tprecious case lying upon the table in front of me, I could not
 10602	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbut think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility
 10603	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich it entailed upon me. There could be no doubt that, as it
 10604	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas a national possession, a horrible scandal would ensue if any
 10605	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmisfortune should occur to it. I already regretted having ever

 10607	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and turned
 10608	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tonce more to my work.

 10610	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave
 10611	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tso precious a thing in the office behind me. Bankers' safes had
 10612	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbeen forced before now, and why should not mine be? If so, how
 10613	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tterrible would be the position in which I should find myself! I
 10614	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdetermined, therefore, that for the next few days I would always
 10615	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcarry the case backward and forward with me, so that it might
 10616	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnever be really out of my reach. With this intention, I called a
 10617	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcab and drove out to my house at Streatham, carrying the jewel
 10618	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twith me. I did not breathe freely until I had taken it upstairs
 10619	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand locked it in the bureau of my dressing-room.
 10620	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10621	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to
 10622	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthoroughly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep
 10623	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tout of the house, and may be set aside altogether. I have three
 10624	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmaid-servants who have been with me a number of years and whose
 10625	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tabsolute reliability is quite above suspicion. Another, Lucy
 10626	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tParr, the second waiting-maid, has only been in my service a few
 10627	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmonths. She came with an excellent character, however, and has
 10628	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\talways given me satisfaction. She is a very pretty girl and has
 10629	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tattracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place.
 10630	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThat is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we
 10631	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbelieve her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.
 10632	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10633	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"So much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it
 10634	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twill not take me long to describe it. I am a widower and have an
 10635	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tonly son, Arthur. He has been a disappointment to me, Mr.
 10636	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHolmes--a grievous disappointment. I have no doubt that I am
 10637	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmyself to blame. People tell me that I have spoiled him. Very
 10638	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlikely I have. When my dear wife died I felt that he was all I
 10639	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thad to love. I could not bear to see the smile fade even for a
 10640	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmoment from his face. I have never denied him a wish. Perhaps it
 10641	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twould have been better for both of us had I been sterner, but I
 10642	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmeant it for the best.
 10643	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10644	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my
 10645	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbusiness, but he was not of a business turn. He was wild,
 10646	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twayward, and, to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the
 10647	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thandling of large sums of money. When he was young he became a
 10648	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmember of an aristocratic club, and there, having charming
 10649	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmanners, he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long
 10650	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpurses and expensive habits. He learned to play heavily at cards
 10651	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand to squander money on the turf, until he had again and again
 10652	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his
 10653	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tallowance, that he might settle his debts of honour. He tried
 10654	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmore than once to break away from the dangerous company which he
 10655	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas keeping, but each time the influence of his friend, Sir
 10656	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tGeorge Burnwell, was enough to draw him back again.
 10657	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10658	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George
 10659	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tBurnwell should gain an influence over him, for he has frequently
 10660	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbrought him to my house, and I have found myself that I could
 10661	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thardly resist the fascination of his manner. He is older than
 10662	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tArthur, a man of the world to his finger-tips, one who had been
 10663	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\teverywhere, seen everything, a brilliant talker, and a man of
 10664	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgreat personal beauty. Yet when I think of him in cold blood, far
 10665	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\taway from the glamour of his presence, I am convinced from his
 10666	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcynical speech and the look which I have caught in his eyes that
 10667	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\the is one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think, and so,
 10668	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttoo, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman's quick insight into
 10669	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcharacter.
 10670	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10671	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but
 10672	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhen my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the
 10673	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tworld I adopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my
 10674	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdaughter. She is a sunbeam in my house--sweet, loving, beautiful,
 10675	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta wonderful manager and housekeeper, yet as tender and quiet and
 10676	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgentle as a woman could be. She is my right hand. I do not know
 10677	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhat I could do without her. In only one matter has she ever gone
 10678	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tagainst my wishes. Twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for
 10679	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\the loves her devotedly, but each time she has refused him. I
 10680	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthink that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it
 10681	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twould have been she, and that his marriage might have changed his
 10682	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhole life; but now, alas! it is too late--forever too late!

 10739	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Tell me, dad,' said she, looking, I thought, a little
 10740	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdisturbed, 'did you give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out
 10741	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto-night?'
 10742	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10743	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Certainly not.'
 10744	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10745	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that she
 10746	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thas only been to the side gate to see someone, but I think that
 10747	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit is hardly safe and should be stopped.'
 10748	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10749	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'You must speak to her in the morning, or I will if you prefer
 10750	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit. Are you sure that everything is fastened?'
 10751	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10752	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Quite sure, dad.'
 10753	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10754	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Then, good-night.' I kissed her and went up to my bedroom
 10755	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tagain, where I was soon asleep.
 10756	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10757	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, which may
 10758	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave any bearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question
 10759	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tme upon any point which I do not make clear."
 10760	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10761	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"On the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid."
 10762	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10763	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be
 10764	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tparticularly so. I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety
 10765	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin my mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual.
 10766	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tAbout two in the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in
 10767	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe house. It had ceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an
 10768	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\timpression behind it as though a window had gently closed
 10769	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsomewhere. I lay listening with all my ears. Suddenly, to my
 10770	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thorror, there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in
 10771	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe next room. I slipped out of bed, all palpitating with fear,
 10772	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door.
 10773	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10774	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Arthur!' I screamed, 'you villain! you thief! How dare you
 10775	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttouch that coronet?'
 10776	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10777	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy,
 10778	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdressed only in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the
 10779	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlight, holding the coronet in his hands. He appeared to be
 10780	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twrenching at it, or bending it with all his strength. At my cry
 10781	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\the dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death. I
 10782	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsnatched it up and examined it. One of the gold corners, with
 10783	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthree of the beryls in it, was missing.
 10784	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10785	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'You blackguard!' I shouted, beside myself with rage. 'You have
 10786	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdestroyed it! You have dishonoured me forever! Where are the
 10787	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tjewels which you have stolen?'
 10788	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10789	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Stolen!' he cried.
 10790	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10791	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Yes, thief!' I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.
 10792	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10793	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,' said he.
 10794	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10795	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'There are three missing. And you know where they are. Must I
 10796	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcall you a liar as well as a thief? Did I not see you trying to
 10797	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttear off another piece?'
 10798	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10799	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'You have called me names enough,' said he, 'I will not stand it
 10800	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tany longer. I shall not say another word about this business,
 10801	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsince you have chosen to insult me. I will leave your house in
 10802	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe morning and make my own way in the world.'
 10803	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10804	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'You shall leave it in the hands of the police!' I cried
 10805	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thalf-mad with grief and rage. 'I shall have this matter probed to
 10806	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe bottom.'
 10807	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10808	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'You shall learn nothing from me,' said he with a passion such
 10809	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tas I should not have thought was in his nature. 'If you choose to
 10810	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcall the police, let the police find what they can.'
 10811	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10812	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"By this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my
 10813	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvoice in my anger. Mary was the first to rush into my room, and,
 10814	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tat the sight of the coronet and of Arthur's face, she read the
 10815	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhole story and, with a scream, fell down senseless on the
 10816	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tground. I sent the house-maid for the police and put the
 10817	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinvestigation into their hands at once. When the inspector and a
 10818	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tconstable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood sullenly with
 10819	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to charge
 10820	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thim with theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a private
 10821	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmatter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was
 10822	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnational property. I was determined that the law should have its
 10823	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tway in everything.
 10824	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10825	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'At least,' said he, 'you will not have me arrested at once. It
 10826	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twould be to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the
 10827	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thouse for five minutes.'
 10828	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10829	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you
 10830	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave stolen,' said I. And then, realising the dreadful position
 10831	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin which I was placed, I implored him to remember that not only
 10832	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmy honour but that of one who was far greater than I was at
 10833	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstake; and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would
 10834	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tconvulse the nation. He might avert it all if he would but tell
 10835	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tme what he had done with the three missing stones.
 10836	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10837	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'You may as well face the matter,' said I; 'you have been caught
 10838	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin the act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous.
 10839	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tIf you but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling
 10840	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tus where the beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.'
 10841	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10842	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,' he answered,
 10843	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tturning away from me with a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened
 10844	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfor any words of mine to influence him. There was but one way for
 10845	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit. I called in the inspector and gave him into custody. A search
 10846	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas made at once not only of his person but of his room and of
 10847	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tevery portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed
 10848	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe gems; but no trace of them could be found, nor would the
 10849	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our
 10850	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthreats. This morning he was removed to a cell, and I, after
 10851	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgoing through all the police formalities, have hurried round to
 10852	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyou to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter.
 10853	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe police have openly confessed that they can at present make
 10854	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnothing of it. You may go to any expense which you think
 10855	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnecessary. I have already offered a reward of 1000 pounds. My
 10856	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tGod, what shall I do! I have lost my honour, my gems, and my son
 10857	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin one night. Oh, what shall I do!"
 10858	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10859	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHe put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to
 10860	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand fro, droning to himself like a child whose grief has got
 10861	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbeyond words.
 10862	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10863	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows
 10864	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tknitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire.
 10865	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10866	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Do you receive much company?" he asked.
 10867	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10868	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"None save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of
 10869	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tArthur's. Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately. No
 10870	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tone else, I think."
 10871	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10872	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Do you go out much in society?"
 10873	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10874	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Arthur does. Mary and I stay at home. We neither of us care for
 10875	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit."
 10876	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10877	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"That is unusual in a young girl."
 10878	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10879	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"She is of a quiet nature. Besides, she is not so very young. She
 10880	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tis four-and-twenty."
 10881	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10882	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"This matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to
 10883	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ther also."
 10884	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10885	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Terrible! She is even more affected than I."
 10886	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10887	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You have neither of you any doubt as to your son's guilt?"
 10888	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10889	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"How can we have when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet
 10890	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin his hands."
 10891	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10892	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I hardly consider that a conclusive proof. Was the remainder of
 10893	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe coronet at all injured?"
 10894	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10895	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, it was twisted."
 10896	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10897	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Do you not think, then, that he might have been trying to
 10898	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstraighten it?"
 10899	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10900	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"God bless you! You are doing what you can for him and for me.
 10901	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tBut it is too heavy a task. What was he doing there at all? If
 10902	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this purpose were innocent, why did he not say so?"
 10903	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10904	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Precisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie?
 10905	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHis silence appears to me to cut both ways. There are several
 10906	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsingular points about the case. What did the police think of the
 10907	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnoise which awoke you from your sleep?"
 10908	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10909	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"They considered that it might be caused by Arthur's closing his
 10910	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbedroom door."
 10911	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10912	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"A likely story! As if a man bent on felony would slam his door
 10913	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tso as to wake a household. What did they say, then, of the
 10914	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdisappearance of these gems?"
 10915	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10916	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"They are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture
 10917	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin the hope of finding them."
 10918	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10919	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Have they thought of looking outside the house?"
 10920	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10921	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The whole garden has
 10922	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\talready been minutely examined."
 10923	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10924	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Now, my dear sir," said Holmes, "is it not obvious to you now
 10925	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you
 10926	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tor the police were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you
 10927	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto be a simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider
 10928	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhat is involved by your theory. You suppose that your son came
 10929	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdown from his bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room,
 10930	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\topened your bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by main
 10931	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tforce a small portion of it, went off to some other place,
 10932	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tconcealed three gems out of the thirty-nine, with such skill that
 10933	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnobody can find them, and then returned with the other thirty-six
 10934	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinto the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger
 10935	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof being discovered. I ask you now, is such a theory tenable?"
 10936	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10937	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But what other is there?" cried the banker with a gesture of
 10938	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdespair. "If his motives were innocent, why does he not explain
 10939	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthem?"
 10940	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10941	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It is our task to find that out," replied Holmes; "so now, if
 10942	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyou please, Mr. Holder, we will set off for Streatham together,
 10943	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into
 10944	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdetails."
 10945	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10946	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tMy friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition,
 10947	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich I was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy
 10948	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twere deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened. I
 10949	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tconfess that the guilt of the banker's son appeared to me to be
 10950	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tas obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still I had such
 10951	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfaith in Holmes' judgment that I felt that there must be some
 10952	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgrounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted
 10953	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\texplanation. He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the
 10954	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsouthern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his breast and his
 10955	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\that drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought. Our client
 10956	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tappeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope
 10957	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich had been presented to him, and he even broke into a
 10958	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdesultory chat with me over his business affairs. A short railway
 10959	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tjourney and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest
 10960	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tresidence of the great financier.
 10961	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10962	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tFairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing
 10963	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tback a little from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a
 10964	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsnow-clad lawn, stretched down in front to two large iron gates
 10965	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich closed the entrance. On the right side was a small wooden
 10966	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthicket, which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges
 10967	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstretching from the road to the kitchen door, and forming the
 10968	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttradesmen's entrance. On the left ran a lane which led to the
 10969	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstables, and was not itself within the grounds at all, being a
 10970	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpublic, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us standing
 10971	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tat the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the
 10972	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfront, down the tradesmen's path, and so round by the garden
 10973	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbehind into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I
 10974	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twent into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should
 10975	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\treturn. We were sitting there in silence when the door opened and
 10976	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta young lady came in. She was rather above the middle height,
 10977	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tslim, with dark hair and eyes, which seemed the darker against
 10978	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe absolute pallor of her skin. I do not think that I have ever
 10979	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tseen such deadly paleness in a woman's face. Her lips, too, were
 10980	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying. As she swept
 10981	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsilently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of
 10982	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgrief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the
 10983	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmore striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong
 10984	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcharacter, with immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding
 10985	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmy presence, she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand
 10986	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tover his head with a sweet womanly caress.
 10987	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10988	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you
 10989	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnot, dad?" she asked.
 10990	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10991	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom."
 10992	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10993	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what woman's
 10994	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinstincts are. I know that he has done no harm and that you will
 10995	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbe sorry for having acted so harshly."
 10996	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10997	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?"
 10998	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 10999	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Who knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should
 11000	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsuspect him."
 11001	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11002	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with
 11003	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe coronet in his hand?"
 11004	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11005	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take
 11006	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmy word for it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say
 11007	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tno more. It is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in
 11008	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tprison!"
 11009	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11010	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I shall never let it drop until the gems are found--never, Mary!
 11011	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tYour affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences
 11012	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto me. Far from hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman
 11013	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdown from London to inquire more deeply into it."
 11014	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11015	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"This gentleman?" she asked, facing round to me.
 11016	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11017	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in
 11018	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe stable lane now."
 11019	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11020	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The stable lane?" She raised her dark eyebrows. "What can he
 11021	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thope to find there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir,
 11022	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat you will succeed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth,
 11023	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat my cousin Arthur is innocent of this crime."
 11024	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11025	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may
 11026	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tprove it," returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the
 11027	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsnow from his shoes. "I believe I have the honour of addressing
 11028	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tMiss Mary Holder. Might I ask you a question or two?"
 11029	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11030	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Pray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up."
 11031	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11032	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You heard nothing yourself last night?"
 11033	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11034	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard
 11035	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat, and I came down."
 11036	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11037	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You shut up the windows and doors the night before. Did you
 11038	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfasten all the windows?"
 11039	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11040	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes."
 11041	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11042	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Were they all fastened this morning?"
 11043	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11044	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes."
 11045	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11046	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked
 11047	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?"
 11048	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11049	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and
 11050	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twho may have heard uncle's remarks about the coronet."
 11051	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11052	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her
 11053	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsweetheart, and that the two may have planned the robbery."
 11054	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11055	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But what is the good of all these vague theories," cried the
 11056	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbanker impatiently, "when I have told you that I saw Arthur with
 11057	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe coronet in his hands?"
 11058	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11059	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Wait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this
 11060	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgirl, Miss Holder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I
 11061	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpresume?"
 11062	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11063	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I
 11064	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmet her slipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom."
 11065	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11066	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Do you know him?"
 11067	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11068	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Oh, yes! he is the green-grocer who brings our vegetables round.
 11069	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHis name is Francis Prosper."
 11070	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11071	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"He stood," said Holmes, "to the left of the door--that is to
 11072	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsay, farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?"
 11073	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11074	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, he did."
 11075	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11076	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And he is a man with a wooden leg?"
 11077	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11078	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSomething like fear sprang up in the young lady's expressive
 11079	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tblack eyes. "Why, you are like a magician," said she. "How do you
 11080	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tknow that?" She smiled, but there was no answering smile in
 11081	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHolmes' thin, eager face.
 11082	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11083	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I should be very glad now to go upstairs," said he. "I shall
 11084	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tprobably wish to go over the outside of the house again. Perhaps
 11085	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI had better take a look at the lower windows before I go up."
 11086	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11087	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHe walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at
 11088	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane.
 11089	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThis he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill
 11090	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twith his powerful magnifying lens. "Now we shall go upstairs,"
 11091	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsaid he at last.
 11092	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11093	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe banker's dressing-room was a plainly furnished little
 11094	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tchamber, with a grey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror.
 11095	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHolmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock.
 11096	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11097	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Which key was used to open it?" he asked.
 11098	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11099	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"That which my son himself indicated--that of the cupboard of the
 11100	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlumber-room."
 11101	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11102	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Have you it here?"
 11103	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11104	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"That is it on the dressing-table."
 11105	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11106	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.
 11107	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11108	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It is a noiseless lock," said he. "It is no wonder that it did
 11109	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnot wake you. This case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must
 11110	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave a look at it." He opened the case, and taking out the diadem
 11111	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\the laid it upon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the
 11112	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tjeweller's art, and the thirty-six stones were the finest that I
 11113	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave ever seen. At one side of the coronet was a cracked edge,
 11114	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhere a corner holding three gems had been torn away.
 11115	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11116	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Now, Mr. Holder," said Holmes, "here is the corner which
 11117	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcorresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I
 11118	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbeg that you will break it off."
 11119	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11120	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe banker recoiled in horror. "I should not dream of trying,"
 11121	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsaid he.
 11122	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11123	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Then I will." Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but
 11124	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twithout result. "I feel it give a little," said he; "but, though
 11125	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI am exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my
 11126	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttime to break it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do
 11127	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyou think would happen if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would
 11128	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbe a noise like a pistol shot. Do you tell me that all this
 11129	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thappened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard
 11130	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnothing of it?"
 11131	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11132	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I do not know what to think. It is all dark to me."
 11133	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11134	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think,
 11135	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tMiss Holder?"
 11136	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11137	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I confess that I still share my uncle's perplexity."
 11138	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11139	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?"
 11140	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11141	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt."
 11142	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11143	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Thank you. We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary
 11144	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tluck during this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault
 11145	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tif we do not succeed in clearing the matter up. With your
 11146	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpermission, Mr. Holder, I shall now continue my investigations
 11147	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\toutside."
 11148	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11149	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHe went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any
 11150	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tunnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult. For an
 11151	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thour or more he was at work, returning at last with his feet
 11152	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\theavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever.
 11153	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11154	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr.
 11155	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHolder," said he; "I can serve you best by returning to my
 11156	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trooms."
 11157	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11158	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?"
 11159	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11160	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I cannot tell."
 11161	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11162	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe banker wrung his hands. "I shall never see them again!" he
 11163	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcried. "And my son? You give me hopes?"
 11164	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11165	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"My opinion is in no way altered."
 11166	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11167	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Then, for God's sake, what was this dark business which was
 11168	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tacted in my house last night?"
 11169	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11170	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"If you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow
 11171	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmorning between nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to
 11172	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmake it clearer. I understand that you give me carte blanche to
 11173	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tact for you, provided only that I get back the gems, and that you
 11174	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tplace no limit on the sum I may draw."
 11175	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11176	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I would give my fortune to have them back."
 11177	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11178	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Very good. I shall look into the matter between this and then.
 11179	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tGood-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here
 11180	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tagain before evening."
 11181	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11182	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tIt was obvious to me that my companion's mind was now made up
 11183	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tabout the case, although what his conclusions were was more than
 11184	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI could even dimly imagine. Several times during our homeward
 11185	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tjourney I endeavoured to sound him upon the point, but he always
 11186	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tglided away to some other topic, until at last I gave it over in
 11187	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdespair. It was not yet three when we found ourselves in our
 11188	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trooms once more. He hurried to his chamber and was down again in
 11189	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta few minutes dressed as a common loafer. With his collar turned
 11190	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tup, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots, he
 11191	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas a perfect sample of the class.
 11192	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11193	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I think that this should do," said he, glancing into the glass
 11194	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tabove the fireplace. "I only wish that you could come with me,
 11195	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWatson, but I fear that it won't do. I may be on the trail in
 11196	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthis matter, or I may be following a will-o'-the-wisp, but I
 11197	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshall soon know which it is. I hope that I may be back in a few
 11198	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thours." He cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard,
 11199	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsandwiched it between two rounds of bread, and thrusting this
 11200	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition.
 11201	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11202	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in
 11203	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\texcellent spirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his
 11204	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thand. He chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a
 11205	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcup of tea.
 11206	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11207	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I only looked in as I passed," said he. "I am going right on."
 11208	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11209	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Where to?"
 11210	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11211	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Oh, to the other side of the West End. It may be some time
 11212	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbefore I get back. Don't wait up for me in case I should be
 11213	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlate."
 11214	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11215	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"How are you getting on?"
 11216	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11217	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Oh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham
 11218	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsince I saw you last, but I did not call at the house. It is a
 11219	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvery sweet little problem, and I would not have missed it for a
 11220	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgood deal. However, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get
 11221	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthese disreputable clothes off and return to my highly
 11222	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trespectable self."
 11223	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11224	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for
 11225	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsatisfaction than his words alone would imply. His eyes twinkled,
 11226	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks. He
 11227	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thastened upstairs, and a few minutes later I heard the slam of
 11228	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe hall door, which told me that he was off once more upon his
 11229	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcongenial hunt.
 11230	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11231	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so
 11232	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI retired to my room. It was no uncommon thing for him to be away
 11233	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfor days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that
 11234	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this lateness caused me no surprise. I do not know at what hour he
 11235	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcame in, but when I came down to breakfast in the morning there
 11236	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\the was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the
 11237	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tother, as fresh and trim as possible.
 11238	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11239	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You will excuse my beginning without you, Watson," said he, "but
 11240	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyou remember that our client has rather an early appointment this
 11241	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmorning."
 11242	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11243	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Why, it is after nine now," I answered. "I should not be
 11244	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsurprised if that were he. I thought I heard a ring."
 11245	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11246	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tIt was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the
 11247	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tchange which had come over him, for his face which was naturally
 11248	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof a broad and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in,
 11249	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhile his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter. He entered
 11250	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twith a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than
 11251	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this violence of the morning before, and he dropped heavily into
 11252	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe armchair which I pushed forward for him.
 11253	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11254	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried," said
 11255	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\the. "Only two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without
 11256	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta care in the world. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured
 11257	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tage. One sorrow comes close upon the heels of another. My niece,
 11258	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tMary, has deserted me."
 11259	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11260	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Deserted you?"
 11261	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11262	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was
 11263	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tempty, and a note for me lay upon the hall table. I had said to
 11264	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ther last night, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had
 11265	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmarried my boy all might have been well with him. Perhaps it was
 11266	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthoughtless of me to say so. It is to that remark that she refers
 11267	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin this note:
 11268	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11269	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'MY DEAREST UNCLE:--I feel that I have brought trouble upon you,
 11270	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune
 11271	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmight never have occurred. I cannot, with this thought in my
 11272	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmind, ever again be happy under your roof, and I feel that I must
 11273	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tleave you forever. Do not worry about my future, for that is
 11274	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tprovided for; and, above all, do not search for me, for it will
 11275	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbe fruitless labour and an ill-service to me. In life or in
 11276	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdeath, I am ever your loving,--MARY.'
 11277	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11278	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it
 11279	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpoints to suicide?"
 11280	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11281	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible
 11282	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsolution. I trust, Mr. Holder, that you are nearing the end of
 11283	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyour troubles."
 11284	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11285	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Ha! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you have
 11286	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlearned something! Where are the gems?"
 11287	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11288	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You would not think 1000 pounds apiece an excessive sum for

 11290	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11291	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I would pay ten."
 11292	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11293	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"That would be unnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matter.
 11294	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tAnd there is a little reward, I fancy. Have you your check-book?
 11295	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHere is a pen. Better make it out for 4000 pounds."
 11296	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11297	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWith a dazed face the banker made out the required check. Holmes
 11298	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twalked over to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of
 11299	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgold with three gems in it, and threw it down upon the table.
 11300	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11301	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWith a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.
 11302	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11303	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You have it!" he gasped. "I am saved! I am saved!"
 11304	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11305	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and
 11306	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\the hugged his recovered gems to his bosom.
 11307	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11308	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"There is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder," said Sherlock
 11309	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHolmes rather sternly.
 11310	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11311	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Owe!" He caught up a pen. "Name the sum, and I will pay it."
 11312	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11313	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No, the debt is not to me. You owe a very humble apology to that
 11314	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnoble lad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I
 11315	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshould be proud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to

 11317	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11318	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Then it was not Arthur who took them?"
 11319	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11320	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not."
 11321	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11322	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once to let him
 11323	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tknow that the truth is known."
 11324	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11325	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"He knows it already. When I had cleared it all up I had an
 11326	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinterview with him, and finding that he would not tell me the
 11327	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstory, I told it to him, on which he had to confess that I was
 11328	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tright and to add the very few details which were not yet quite
 11329	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tclear to me. Your news of this morning, however, may open his
 11330	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlips."
 11331	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11332	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"For heaven's sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary
 11333	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmystery!"
 11334	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11335	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached
 11336	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit. And let me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me
 11337	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto say and for you to hear: there has been an understanding
 11338	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbetween Sir George Burnwell and your niece Mary. They have now
 11339	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfled together."
 11340	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11341	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"My Mary? Impossible!"
 11342	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11343	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain. Neither
 11344	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyou nor your son knew the true character of this man when you
 11345	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tadmitted him into your family circle. He is one of the most
 11346	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdangerous men in England--a ruined gambler, an absolutely
 11347	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdesperate villain, a man without heart or conscience. Your niece
 11348	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tknew nothing of such men. When he breathed his vows to her, as he
 11349	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thad done to a hundred before her, she flattered herself that she
 11350	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\talone had touched his heart. The devil knows best what he said,
 11351	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbut at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing
 11352	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thim nearly every evening."
 11353	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11354	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I cannot, and I will not, believe it!" cried the banker with an
 11355	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tashen face.
 11356	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11357	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night.
 11358	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tYour niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room,
 11359	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tslipped down and talked to her lover through the window which
 11360	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tleads into the stable lane. His footmarks had pressed right
 11361	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthrough the snow, so long had he stood there. She told him of the
 11362	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcoronet. His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he
 11363	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbent her to his will. I have no doubt that she loved you, but
 11364	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthere are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all
 11365	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tother loves, and I think that she must have been one. She had
 11366	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming
 11367	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdownstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told you
 11368	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tabout one of the servants' escapade with her wooden-legged lover,
 11369	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich was all perfectly true.
 11370	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11371	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Your boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you but
 11372	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\the slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts.
 11373	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tIn the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door,
 11374	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tso he rose and, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin
 11375	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twalking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared
 11376	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinto your dressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad
 11377	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tslipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what
 11378	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twould come of this strange affair. Presently she emerged from the
 11379	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\troom again, and in the light of the passage-lamp your son saw
 11380	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat she carried the precious coronet in her hands. She passed
 11381	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdown the stairs, and he, thrilling with horror, ran along and
 11382	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tslipped behind the curtain near your door, whence he could see
 11383	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhat passed in the hall beneath. He saw her stealthily open the
 11384	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twindow, hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom, and then
 11385	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tclosing it once more hurry back to her room, passing quite close
 11386	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto where he stood hid behind the curtain.
 11387	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11388	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"As long as she was on the scene he could not take any action
 11389	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twithout a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. But the
 11390	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinstant that she was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune
 11391	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthis would be for you, and how all-important it was to set it
 11392	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tright. He rushed down, just as he was, in his bare feet, opened
 11393	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe window, sprang out into the snow, and ran down the lane,
 11394	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhere he could see a dark figure in the moonlight. Sir George
 11395	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tBurnwell tried to get away, but Arthur caught him, and there was
 11396	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta struggle between them, your lad tugging at one side of the
 11397	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcoronet, and his opponent at the other. In the scuffle, your son
 11398	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstruck Sir George and cut him over the eye. Then something
 11399	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsuddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet
 11400	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin his hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your
 11401	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\troom, and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in
 11402	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you
 11403	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tappeared upon the scene."
 11404	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11405	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Is it possible?" gasped the banker.
 11406	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11407	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when
 11408	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\the felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not
 11409	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\texplain the true state of affairs without betraying one who
 11410	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcertainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands. He
 11411	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttook the more chivalrous view, however, and preserved her
 11412	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsecret."
 11413	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11414	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the
 11415	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcoronet," cried Mr. Holder. "Oh, my God! what a blind fool I have
 11416	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbeen! And his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes!
 11417	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the
 11418	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tscene of the struggle. How cruelly I have misjudged him!"
 11419	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11420	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"When I arrived at the house," continued Holmes, "I at once went
 11421	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvery carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in
 11422	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe snow which might help me. I knew that none had fallen since
 11423	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe evening before, and also that there had been a strong frost
 11424	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto preserve impressions. I passed along the tradesmen's path, but
 11425	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfound it all trampled down and indistinguishable. Just beyond it,
 11426	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thowever, at the far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood
 11427	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand talked with a man, whose round impressions on one side showed
 11428	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat he had a wooden leg. I could even tell that they had been
 11429	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdisturbed, for the woman had run back swiftly to the door, as was
 11430	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshown by the deep toe and light heel marks, while Wooden-leg had
 11431	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twaited a little, and then had gone away. I thought at the time
 11432	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of whom you had
 11433	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\talready spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so. I passed
 11434	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tround the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks,
 11435	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable
 11436	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in
 11437	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfront of me.
 11438	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11439	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second
 11440	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdouble line which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked
 11441	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfeet. I was at once convinced from what you had told me that the
 11442	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlatter was your son. The first had walked both ways, but the
 11443	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tother had run swiftly, and as his tread was marked in places over
 11444	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed
 11445	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tafter the other. I followed them up and found they led to the
 11446	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thall window, where Boots had worn all the snow away while
 11447	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twaiting. Then I walked to the other end, which was a hundred
 11448	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced round,
 11449	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhere the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle,
 11450	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand, finally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me
 11451	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat I was not mistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and
 11452	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tanother little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been
 11453	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thurt. When he came to the highroad at the other end, I found that
 11454	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe pavement had been cleared, so there was an end to that clue.
 11455	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11456	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the
 11457	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsill and framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could
 11458	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tat once see that someone had passed out. I could distinguish the
 11459	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\toutline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming
 11460	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin. I was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what
 11461	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thad occurred. A man had waited outside the window; someone had
 11462	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbrought the gems; the deed had been overseen by your son; he had
 11463	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpursued the thief; had struggled with him; they had each tugged
 11464	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tat the coronet, their united strength causing injuries which
 11465	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tneither alone could have effected. He had returned with the
 11466	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tprize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent. So
 11467	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfar I was clear. The question now was, who was the man and who
 11468	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas it brought him the coronet?
 11469	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11470	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the
 11471	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\timpossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the
 11472	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttruth. Now, I knew that it was not you who had brought it down,
 11473	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tso there only remained your niece and the maids. But if it were
 11474	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe maids, why should your son allow himself to be accused in
 11475	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttheir place? There could be no possible reason. As he loved his
 11476	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should
 11477	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tretain her secret--the more so as the secret was a disgraceful
 11478	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tone. When I remembered that you had seen her at that window, and
 11479	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thow she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my conjecture
 11480	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbecame a certainty.
 11481	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11482	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently,
 11483	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfor who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must
 11484	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfeel to you? I knew that you went out little, and that your
 11485	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcircle of friends was a very limited one. But among them was Sir
 11486	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tGeorge Burnwell. I had heard of him before as being a man of evil
 11487	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\treputation among women. It must have been he who wore those boots
 11488	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand retained the missing gems. Even though he knew that Arthur
 11489	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thad discovered him, he might still flatter himself that he was
 11490	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsafe, for the lad could not say a word without compromising his
 11491	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\town family.
 11492	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11493	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took
 11494	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnext. I went in the shape of a loafer to Sir George's house,
 11495	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmanaged to pick up an acquaintance with his valet, learned that
 11496	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this master had cut his head the night before, and, finally, at
 11497	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe expense of six shillings, made all sure by buying a pair of
 11498	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this cast-off shoes. With these I journeyed down to Streatham and
 11499	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsaw that they exactly fitted the tracks."
 11500	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11501	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening,"
 11502	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsaid Mr. Holder.
 11503	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11504	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Precisely. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home
 11505	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand changed my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to
 11506	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tplay then, for I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert
 11507	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tscandal, and I knew that so astute a villain would see that our
 11508	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thands were tied in the matter. I went and saw him. At first, of
 11509	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcourse, he denied everything. But when I gave him every
 11510	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tparticular that had occurred, he tried to bluster and took down a
 11511	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlife-preserver from the wall. I knew my man, however, and I
 11512	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tclapped a pistol to his head before he could strike. Then he
 11513	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbecame a little more reasonable. I told him that we would give
 11514	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thim a price for the stones he held--1000 pounds apiece. That
 11515	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbrought out the first signs of grief that he had shown. 'Why,
 11516	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdash it all!' said he, 'I've let them go at six hundred for the
 11517	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthree!' I soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had
 11518	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthem, on promising him that there would be no prosecution. Off I
 11519	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tset to him, and after much chaffering I got our stones at 1000
 11520	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpounds apiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told him that all
 11521	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas right, and eventually got to my bed about two o'clock, after
 11522	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhat I may call a really hard day's work."
 11523	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11524	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"A day which has saved England from a great public scandal," said
 11525	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe banker, rising. "Sir, I cannot find words to thank you, but
 11526	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyou shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done. Your
 11527	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tskill has indeed exceeded all that I have heard of it. And now I
 11528	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmust fly to my dear boy to apologise to him for the wrong which I
 11529	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave done him. As to what you tell me of poor Mary, it goes to my
 11530	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvery heart. Not even your skill can inform me where she is now."
 11531	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11532	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I think that we may safely say," returned Holmes, "that she is
 11533	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twherever Sir George Burnwell is. It is equally certain, too, that
 11534	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than
 11535	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsufficient punishment."

 11540	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11541	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"To the man who loves art for its own sake," remarked Sherlock
 11542	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHolmes, tossing aside the advertisement sheet of the Daily
 11543	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tTelegraph, "it is frequently in its least important and lowliest
 11544	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmanifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived. It is
 11545	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpleasant to me to observe, Watson, that you have so far grasped
 11546	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthis truth that in these little records of our cases which you
 11547	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave been good enough to draw up, and, I am bound to say,
 11548	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\toccasionally to embellish, you have given prominence not so much
 11549	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto the many causes cÃ©lÃ¨bres and sensational trials in which I
 11550	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave figured but rather to those incidents which may have been
 11551	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttrivial in themselves, but which have given room for those
 11552	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfaculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made
 11553	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmy special province."
 11554	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11555	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And yet," said I, smiling, "I cannot quite hold myself absolved
 11556	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfrom the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my
 11557	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trecords."
 11558	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11559	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You have erred, perhaps," he observed, taking up a glowing
 11560	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood
 11561	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a
 11562	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdisputatious rather than a meditative mood--"you have erred
 11563	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tperhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your
 11564	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstatements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing
 11565	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tupon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is
 11566	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\treally the only notable feature about the thing."
 11567	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11568	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter,"
 11569	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI remarked with some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism
 11570	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich I had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my
 11571	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfriend's singular character.
 11572	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11573	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No, it is not selfishness or conceit," said he, answering, as
 11574	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas his wont, my thoughts rather than my words. "If I claim full
 11575	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tjustice for my art, it is because it is an impersonal thing--a
 11576	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthing beyond myself. Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it
 11577	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tis upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should
 11578	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdwell. You have degraded what should have been a course of
 11579	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlectures into a series of tales."
 11580	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11581	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tIt was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after
 11582	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbreakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at
 11583	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tBaker Street. A thick fog rolled down between the lines of
 11584	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdun-coloured houses, and the opposing windows loomed like dark,
 11585	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths. Our gas was lit
 11586	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal, for
 11587	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe table had not been cleared yet. Sherlock Holmes had been
 11588	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsilent all the morning, dipping continuously into the
 11589	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tadvertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last,
 11590	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thaving apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very
 11591	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.
 11592	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11593	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"At the same time," he remarked after a pause, during which he
 11594	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thad sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire,
 11595	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of
 11596	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthese cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself
 11597	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin, a fair proportion do not treat of crime, in its legal sense,
 11598	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tat all. The small matter in which I endeavoured to help the King
 11599	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof Bohemia, the singular experience of Miss Mary Sutherland, the
 11600	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tproblem connected with the man with the twisted lip, and the
 11601	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tincident of the noble bachelor, were all matters which are
 11602	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\toutside the pale of the law. But in avoiding the sensational, I
 11603	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfear that you may have bordered on the trivial."
 11604	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11605	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The end may have been so," I answered, "but the methods I hold
 11606	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto have been novel and of interest."
 11607	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11608	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Pshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant
 11609	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpublic, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a
 11610	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcompositor by his left thumb, care about the finer shades of
 11611	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tanalysis and deduction! But, indeed, if you are trivial, I cannot
 11612	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tblame you, for the days of the great cases are past. Man, or at
 11613	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tleast criminal man, has lost all enterprise and originality. As
 11614	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto my own little practice, it seems to be degenerating into an
 11615	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tagency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to
 11616	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyoung ladies from boarding-schools. I think that I have touched
 11617	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbottom at last, however. This note I had this morning marks my
 11618	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tzero-point, I fancy. Read it!" He tossed a crumpled letter across

 11620	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11621	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tIt was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening, and

 11624	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"DEAR MR. HOLMES:--I am very anxious to consult you as to whether

 11654	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfrom whom I could ask advice, I thought that perhaps you would be

 11660	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner

 11691	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tCapital! capital!' He seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his
 11692	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thands together in the most genial fashion. He was such a
 11693	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcomfortable-looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at

 11825	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfoolish thing. After all, if these people had strange fads and
 11826	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\texpected obedience on the most extraordinary matters, they were
 11827	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tat least ready to pay for their eccentricity. Very few

 11829	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhat use was my hair to me? Many people are improved by wearing
 11830	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit short and perhaps I should be among the number. Next day I was
 11831	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinclined to think that I had made a mistake, and by the day after
 11832	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI was sure of it. I had almost overcome my pride so far as to go
 11833	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tback to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open
 11834	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhen I received this letter from the gentleman himself. I have it

 11847	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnot, however, go to the expense of purchasing one, as we have one

 11928	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tturning in her direction and wondering what strange side-alley of
 11929	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thuman experience this lonely woman had strayed into. The unusual
 11930	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsalary, the curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to
 11931	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsomething abnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether
 11932	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe man were a philanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond
 11933	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmy powers to determine. As to Holmes, I observed that he sat
 11934	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfrequently for half an hour on end, with knitted brows and an
 11935	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tabstracted air, but he swept the matter away with a wave of his
 11936	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thand when I mentioned it. "Data! data! data!" he cried
 11937	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\timpatiently. "I can't make bricks without clay." And yet he would
 11938	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\talways wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever
 11939	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave accepted such a situation.
 11940	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11941	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe telegram which we eventually received came late one night
 11942	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tjust as I was thinking of turning in and Holmes was settling down
 11943	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto one of those all-night chemical researches which he frequently
 11944	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tindulged in, when I would leave him stooping over a retort and a
 11945	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttest-tube at night and find him in the same position when I came
 11946	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdown to breakfast in the morning. He opened the yellow envelope,
 11947	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand then, glancing at the message, threw it across to me.
 11948	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11949	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Just look up the trains in Bradshaw," said he, and turned back
 11950	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto his chemical studies.
 11951	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11952	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe summons was a brief and urgent one.
 11953	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11954	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Please be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday
 11955	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto-morrow," it said. "Do come! I am at my wit's end.  HUNTER."
 11956	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11957	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Will you come with me?" asked Holmes, glancing up.
 11958	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11959	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I should wish to."
 11960	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11961	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Just look it up, then."
 11962	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11963	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"There is a train at half-past nine," said I, glancing over my
 11964	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tBradshaw. "It is due at Winchester at 11:30."
 11965	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11966	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"That will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better postpone my
 11967	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tanalysis of the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the
 11968	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmorning."
 11969	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11970	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tBy eleven o'clock the next day we were well upon our way to the

 11973	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthrew them down and began to admire the scenery. It was an ideal
 11974	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tspring day, a light blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white
 11975	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tclouds drifting across from west to east. The sun was shining
 11976	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvery brightly, and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air,
 11977	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich set an edge to a man's energy. All over the countryside,
 11978	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\taway to the rolling hills around Aldershot, the little red and
 11979	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgrey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid the light
 11980	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgreen of the new foliage.
 11981	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11982	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Are they not fresh and beautiful?" I cried with all the
 11983	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tenthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.
 11984	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11985	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tBut Holmes shook his head gravely.
 11986	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11987	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Do you know, Watson," said he, "that it is one of the curses of
 11988	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta mind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with
 11989	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\treference to my own special subject. You look at these scattered
 11990	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thouses, and you are impressed by their beauty. I look at them,
 11991	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their
 11992	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tisolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed
 11993	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthere."
 11994	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11995	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Good heavens!" I cried. "Who would associate crime with these
 11996	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdear old homesteads?"
 11997	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 11998	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"They always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief,
 11999	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWatson, founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest
 12000	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\talleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin
 12001	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthan does the smiling and beautiful countryside."
 12002	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12003	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You horrify me!"
 12004	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12005	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion
 12006	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcan do in the town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no
 12007	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlane so vile that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of
 12008	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta drunkard's blow, does not beget sympathy and indignation among
 12009	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe neighbours, and then the whole machinery of justice is ever

 12011	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbut a step between the crime and the dock. But look at these
 12012	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlonely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part
 12013	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twith poor ignorant folk who know little of the law. Think of the
 12014	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdeeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on,

 12016	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlady who appeals to us for help gone to live in Winchester, I
 12017	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshould never have had a fear for her. It is the five miles of
 12018	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcountry which makes the danger. Still, it is clear that she is
 12019	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnot personally threatened."
 12020	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12021	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"No. If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away."
 12022	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12023	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Quite so. She has her freedom."
 12024	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12025	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What CAN be the matter, then? Can you suggest no explanation?"
 12026	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12027	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would
 12028	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcover the facts as far as we know them. But which of these is
 12029	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcorrect can only be determined by the fresh information which we
 12030	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshall no doubt find waiting for us. Well, there is the tower of
 12031	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe cathedral, and we shall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has

 12035	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdistance from the station, and there we found the young lady
 12036	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twaiting for us. She had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch
 12037	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tawaited us upon the table.
 12038	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12039	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I am so delighted that you have come," she said earnestly. "It

 12042	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12043	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Pray tell us what has happened to you."
 12044	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12045	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr.
 12046	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tRucastle to be back before three. I got his leave to come into

 12048	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t

 12054	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tonly fair to them to say that. But I cannot understand them, and
 12055	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI am not easy in my mind about them."

 12059	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Their reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just
 12060	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tas it occurred. When I came down, Mr. Rucastle met me here and
 12061	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdrove me in his dog-cart to the Copper Beeches. It is, as he
 12062	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsaid, beautifully situated, but it is not beautiful in itself,
 12063	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfor it is a large square block of a house, whitewashed, but all
 12064	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstained and streaked with damp and bad weather. There are grounds
 12065	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tround it, woods on three sides, and on the fourth a field which
 12066	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tslopes down to the Southampton highroad, which curves past about
 12067	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta hundred yards from the front door. This ground in front belongs
 12068	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto the house, but the woods all round are part of Lord
 12069	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tSoutherton's preserves. A clump of copper beeches immediately in
 12070	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfront of the hall door has given its name to the place.
 12071	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12072	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever,
 12073	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child.
 12074	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThere was no truth, Mr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to
 12075	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tus to be probable in your rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is
 12076	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnot mad. I found her to be a silent, pale-faced woman, much
 12077	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyounger than her husband, not more than thirty, I should think,
 12078	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhile he can hardly be less than forty-five. From their
 12079	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tconversation I have gathered that they have been married about
 12080	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tseven years, that he was a widower, and that his only child by
 12081	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe first wife was the daughter who has gone to Philadelphia. Mr.
 12082	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tRucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them
 12083	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother. As
 12084	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe daughter could not have been less than twenty, I can quite
 12085	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\timagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her

 12087	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12088	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Mrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as
 12089	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin feature. She impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse.
 12090	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tShe was a nonentity. It was easy to see that she was passionately
 12091	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdevoted both to her husband and to her little son. Her light grey
 12092	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\teyes wandered continually from one to the other, noting every
 12093	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlittle want and forestalling it if possible. He was kind to her
 12094	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\talso in his bluff, boisterous fashion, and on the whole they
 12095	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tseemed to be a happy couple. And yet she had some secret sorrow,
 12096	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthis woman. She would often be lost in deep thought, with the
 12097	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsaddest look upon her face. More than once I have surprised her
 12098	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin tears. I have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of
 12099	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ther child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never met so
 12100	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tutterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature. He is small
 12101	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfor his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large.
 12102	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHis whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between
 12103	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsavage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking. Giving
 12104	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea
 12105	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof amusement, and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning
 12106	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe capture of mice, little birds, and insects. But I would

 12114	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tunpleasant thing about the house, which struck me at once, was
 12115	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe appearance and conduct of the servants. There are only two, a
 12116	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tman and his wife. Toller, for that is his name, is a rough,
 12117	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tuncouth man, with grizzled hair and whiskers, and a perpetual
 12118	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsmell of drink. Twice since I have been with them he has been
 12119	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tquite drunk, and yet Mr. Rucastle seemed to take no notice of it.

 12145	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\talong the entire front of the house, with three long windows

 12147	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcentral window, with its back turned towards it. In this I was

 12160	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\texactly similar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I
 12161	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsat in the window, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny
 12162	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstories of which my employer had an immense rÃ©pertoire, and which
 12163	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\the told inimitably. Then he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and
 12164	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmoving my chair a little sideways, that my own shadow might not
 12165	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfall upon the page, he begged me to read aloud to him. I read for
 12166	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tabout ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and then
 12167	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsuddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he ordered me to cease and
 12168	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto change my dress.
 12169	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12170	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I became as to
 12171	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhat the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly
 12172	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbe. They were always very careful, I observed, to turn my face
 12173	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\taway from the window, so that I became consumed with the desire
 12174	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto see what was going on behind my back. At first it seemed to be
 12175	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\timpossible, but I soon devised a means. My hand-mirror had been
 12176	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbroken, so a happy thought seized me, and I concealed a piece of
 12177	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe glass in my handkerchief. On the next occasion, in the midst
 12178	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof my laughter, I put my handkerchief up to my eyes, and was able
 12179	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twith a little management to see all that there was behind me. I
 12180	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tconfess that I was disappointed. There was nothing. At least that
 12181	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas my first impression. At the second glance, however, I
 12182	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tperceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton Road,
 12183	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta small bearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in
 12184	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmy direction. The road is an important highway, and there are
 12185	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tusually people there. This man, however, was leaning against the
 12186	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trailings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up. I
 12187	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlowered my handkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to find her
 12188	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\teyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze. She said nothing,
 12189	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbut I am convinced that she had divined that I had a mirror in my
 12190	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thand and had seen what was behind me. She rose at once.
 12191	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12192	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Jephro,' said she, 'there is an impertinent fellow upon the
 12193	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\troad there who stares up at Miss Hunter.'
 12194	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12195	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?' he asked.
 12196	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12197	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'No, I know no one in these parts.'
 12198	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12199	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion to
 12200	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thim to go away.'
 12201	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12202	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Surely it would be better to take no notice.'
 12203	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12204	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly turn
 12205	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tround and wave him away like that.'
 12206	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12207	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew
 12208	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdown the blind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have
 12209	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnot sat again in the window, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor
 12210	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tseen the man in the road."
 12211	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12212	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Pray continue," said Holmes. "Your narrative promises to be a
 12213	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmost interesting one."
 12214	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12215	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may
 12216	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tprove to be little relation between the different incidents of
 12217	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich I speak. On the very first day that I was at the Copper
 12218	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tBeeches, Mr. Rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands
 12219	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnear the kitchen door. As we approached it I heard the sharp
 12220	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trattling of a chain, and the sound as of a large animal moving
 12221	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tabout.
 12222	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12223	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Look in here!' said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit between two
 12224	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tplanks. 'Is he not a beauty?'
 12225	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12226	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a
 12227	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tvague figure huddled up in the darkness.
 12228	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12229	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Don't be frightened,' said my employer, laughing at the start
 12230	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhich I had given. 'It's only Carlo, my mastiff. I call him mine,
 12231	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbut really old Toller, my groom, is the only man who can do
 12232	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tanything with him. We feed him once a day, and not too much then,
 12233	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tso that he is always as keen as mustard. Toller lets him loose
 12234	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tevery night, and God help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs
 12235	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tupon. For goodness' sake don't you ever on any pretext set your
 12236	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfoot over the threshold at night, for it's as much as your life
 12237	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tis worth.'
 12238	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12239	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"The warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to
 12240	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlook out of my bedroom window about two o'clock in the morning.
 12241	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tIt was a beautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the
 12242	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thouse was silvered over and almost as bright as day. I was
 12243	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstanding, rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was
 12244	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\taware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper
 12245	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbeeches. As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was. It
 12246	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas a giant dog, as large as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging
 12247	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tjowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting bones. It walked slowly
 12248	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tacross the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side.
 12249	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThat dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart which I do not
 12250	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthink that any burglar could have done.
 12251	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12252	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as
 12253	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyou know, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a
 12254	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgreat coil at the bottom of my trunk. One evening, after the
 12255	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tchild was in bed, I began to amuse myself by examining the
 12256	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfurniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things.
 12257	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThere was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper ones
 12258	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tempty and open, the lower one locked. I had filled the first two
 12259	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twith my linen, and as I had still much to pack away I was
 12260	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnaturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer. It
 12261	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstruck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight,
 12262	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tso I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The very
 12263	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfirst key fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There
 12264	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas only one thing in it, but I am sure that you would never
 12265	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tguess what it was. It was my coil of hair.
 12266	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12267	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint,
 12268	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand the same thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing
 12269	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tobtruded itself upon me. How could my hair have been locked in
 12270	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe drawer? With trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the
 12271	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcontents, and drew from the bottom my own hair. I laid the two
 12272	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttresses together, and I assure you that they were identical. Was
 12273	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit not extraordinary? Puzzle as I would, I could make nothing at
 12274	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tall of what it meant. I returned the strange hair to the drawer,
 12275	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand I said nothing of the matter to the Rucastles as I felt that
 12276	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had
 12277	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlocked.
 12278	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12279	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes,
 12280	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand I soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head.
 12281	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThere was one wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited
 12282	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tat all. A door which faced that which led into the quarters of
 12283	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe Tollers opened into this suite, but it was invariably locked.
 12284	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tOne day, however, as I ascended the stair, I met Mr. Rucastle
 12285	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcoming out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a look on
 12286	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this face which made him a very different person to the round,
 12287	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tjovial man to whom I was accustomed. His cheeks were red, his
 12288	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbrow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins stood out at his
 12289	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttemples with passion. He locked the door and hurried past me
 12290	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twithout a word or a look.
 12291	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12292	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"This aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the
 12293	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgrounds with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I
 12294	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcould see the windows of this part of the house. There were four
 12295	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof them in a row, three of which were simply dirty, while the
 12296	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfourth was shuttered up. They were evidently all deserted. As I
 12297	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstrolled up and down, glancing at them occasionally, Mr. Rucastle
 12298	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcame out to me, looking as merry and jovial as ever.
 12299	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12300	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Ah!' said he, 'you must not think me rude if I passed you
 12301	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twithout a word, my dear young lady. I was preoccupied with
 12302	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbusiness matters.'
 12303	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12304	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I assured him that I was not offended. 'By the way,' said I,
 12305	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t'you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one
 12306	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof them has the shutters up.'
 12307	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12308	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"He looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled
 12309	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tat my remark.
 12310	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12311	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Photography is one of my hobbies,' said he. 'I have made my
 12312	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdark room up there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we
 12313	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave come upon. Who would have believed it? Who would have ever
 12314	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbelieved it?' He spoke in a jesting tone, but there was no jest
 12315	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin his eyes as he looked at me. I read suspicion there and
 12316	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tannoyance, but no jest.
 12317	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12318	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Well, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there
 12319	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas something about that suite of rooms which I was not to know,
 12320	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI was all on fire to go over them. It was not mere curiosity,
 12321	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthough I have my share of that. It was more a feeling of duty--a
 12322	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfeeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this
 12323	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tplace. They talk of woman's instinct; perhaps it was woman's
 12324	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinstinct which gave me that feeling. At any rate, it was there,
 12325	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand I was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the
 12326	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tforbidden door.
 12327	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12328	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that,
 12329	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbesides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to
 12330	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdo in these deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large
 12331	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tblack linen bag with him through the door. Recently he has been
 12332	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdrinking hard, and yesterday evening he was very drunk; and when
 12333	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI came upstairs there was the key in the door. I have no doubt at
 12334	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tall that he had left it there. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both
 12335	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdownstairs, and the child was with them, so that I had an
 12336	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tadmirable opportunity. I turned the key gently in the lock,
 12337	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\topened the door, and slipped through.
 12338	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12339	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and
 12340	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tuncarpeted, which turned at a right angle at the farther end.
 12341	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tRound this corner were three doors in a line, the first and third
 12342	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof which were open. They each led into an empty room, dusty and
 12343	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcheerless, with two windows in the one and one in the other, so
 12344	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through
 12345	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthem. The centre door was closed, and across the outside of it
 12346	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thad been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed, padlocked
 12347	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tat one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened at the other with
 12348	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstout cord. The door itself was locked as well, and the key was
 12349	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnot there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the
 12350	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from
 12351	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbeneath it that the room was not in darkness. Evidently there was
 12352	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta skylight which let in light from above. As I stood in the
 12353	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpassage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it
 12354	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmight veil, I suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room
 12355	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little
 12356	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tslit of dim light which shone out from under the door. A mad,
 12357	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tunreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight, Mr. Holmes. My
 12358	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\toverstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I turned and ran--ran
 12359	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tas though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the
 12360	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tskirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through the door,
 12361	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting
 12362	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\toutside.
 12363	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12364	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'So,' said he, smiling, 'it was you, then. I thought that it
 12365	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmust be when I saw the door open.'
 12366	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12367	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Oh, I am so frightened!' I panted.
 12368	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12369	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'My dear young lady! my dear young lady!'--you cannot think how
 12370	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcaressing and soothing his manner was--'and what has frightened
 12371	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyou, my dear young lady?'
 12372	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12373	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I
 12374	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas keenly on my guard against him.
 12375	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12376	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,' I answered.
 12377	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t'But it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was
 12378	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfrightened and ran out again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in
 12379	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthere!'
 12380	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12381	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Only that?' said he, looking at me keenly.
 12382	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12383	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Why, what did you think?' I asked.
 12384	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12385	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Why do you think that I lock this door?'
 12386	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12387	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'I am sure that I do not know.'
 12388	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12389	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'It is to keep people out who have no business there. Do you
 12390	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsee?' He was still smiling in the most amiable manner.
 12391	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12392	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'I am sure if I had known--'
 12393	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12394	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"'Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put your foot over
 12395	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat threshold again'--here in an instant the smile hardened into
 12396	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ta grin of rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a
 12397	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdemon--'I'll throw you to the mastiff.'
 12398	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12399	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that
 12400	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI must have rushed past him into my room. I remember nothing
 12401	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tuntil I found myself lying on my bed trembling all over. Then I
 12402	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthought of you, Mr. Holmes. I could not live there longer without
 12403	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsome advice. I was frightened of the house, of the man, of the
 12404	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twoman, of the servants, even of the child. They were all horrible
 12405	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto me. If I could only bring you down all would be well. Of
 12406	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcourse I might have fled from the house, but my curiosity was
 12407	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\talmost as strong as my fears. My mind was soon made up. I would
 12408	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsend you a wire. I put on my hat and cloak, went down to the
 12409	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\toffice, which is about half a mile from the house, and then
 12410	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\treturned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my
 12411	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmind as I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I
 12412	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tremembered that Toller had drunk himself into a state of
 12413	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinsensibility that evening, and I knew that he was the only one
 12414	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tin the household who had any influence with the savage creature,
 12415	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tor who would venture to set him free. I slipped in in safety and
 12416	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you.
 12417	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tI had no difficulty in getting leave to come into Winchester this
 12418	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmorning, but I must be back before three o'clock, for Mr. and
 12419	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tMrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all the
 12420	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tevening, so that I must look after the child. Now I have told you
 12421	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tall my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad if you
 12422	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcould tell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should
 12423	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdo."
 12424	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12425	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHolmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story.
 12426	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tMy friend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in
 12427	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this pockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon
 12428	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this face.
 12429	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12430	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Is Toller still drunk?" he asked.
 12431	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12432	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do
 12433	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tnothing with him."
 12434	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12435	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"That is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?"
 12436	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12437	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes."
 12438	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12439	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Is there a cellar with a good strong lock?"
 12440	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12441	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, the wine-cellar."
 12442	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12443	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very
 12444	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbrave and sensible girl, Miss Hunter. Do you think that you could
 12445	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tperform one more feat? I should not ask it of you if I did not
 12446	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthink you a quite exceptional woman."
 12447	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12448	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I will try. What is it?"
 12449	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12450	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o'clock, my friend
 12451	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand I. The Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will,
 12452	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twe hope, be incapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might
 12453	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgive the alarm. If you could send her into the cellar on some
 12454	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\terrand, and then turn the key upon her, you would facilitate
 12455	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmatters immensely."
 12456	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12457	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I will do it."
 12458	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12459	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Excellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of
 12460	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcourse there is only one feasible explanation. You have been
 12461	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbrought there to personate someone, and the real person is
 12462	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\timprisoned in this chamber. That is obvious. As to who this
 12463	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tprisoner is, I have no doubt that it is the daughter, Miss Alice
 12464	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tRucastle, if I remember right, who was said to have gone to
 12465	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tAmerica. You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in height,
 12466	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfigure, and the colour of your hair. Hers had been cut off, very
 12467	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpossibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of
 12468	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcourse, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a curious chance you
 12469	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcame upon her tresses. The man in the road was undoubtedly some
 12470	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfriend of hers--possibly her fiancÃ©--and no doubt, as you wore
 12471	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe girl's dress and were so like her, he was convinced from your
 12472	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlaughter, whenever he saw you, and afterwards from your gesture,
 12473	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthat Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy, and that she no longer
 12474	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdesired his attentions. The dog is let loose at night to prevent
 12475	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thim from endeavouring to communicate with her. So much is fairly
 12476	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tclear. The most serious point in the case is the disposition of
 12477	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe child."
 12478	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12479	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"What on earth has that to do with it?" I ejaculated.
 12480	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12481	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"My dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining
 12482	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlight as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the
 12483	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tparents. Don't you see that the converse is equally valid. I have
 12484	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfrequently gained my first real insight into the character of
 12485	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tparents by studying their children. This child's disposition is
 12486	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tabnormally cruel, merely for cruelty's sake, and whether he
 12487	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tderives this from his smiling father, as I should suspect, or
 12488	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfrom his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their
 12489	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpower."
 12490	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12491	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes," cried our client. "A
 12492	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthousand things come back to me which make me certain that you
 12493	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thave hit it. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to
 12494	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthis poor creature."
 12495	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12496	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"We must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning
 12497	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tman. We can do nothing until seven o'clock. At that hour we shall
 12498	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbe with you, and it will not be long before we solve the
 12499	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmystery."
 12500	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12501	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWe were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we
 12502	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\treached the Copper Beeches, having put up our trap at a wayside
 12503	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpublic-house. The group of trees, with their dark leaves shining
 12504	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlike burnished metal in the light of the setting sun, were
 12505	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsufficient to mark the house even had Miss Hunter not been
 12506	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstanding smiling on the door-step.
 12507	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12508	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Have you managed it?" asked Holmes.
 12509	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12510	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tA loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs. "That is
 12511	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tMrs. Toller in the cellar," said she. "Her husband lies snoring
 12512	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ton the kitchen rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates
 12513	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof Mr. Rucastle's."
 12514	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12515	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You have done well indeed!" cried Holmes with enthusiasm. "Now
 12516	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tlead the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black
 12517	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbusiness."
 12518	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12519	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWe passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a
 12520	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpassage, and found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss
 12521	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHunter had described. Holmes cut the cord and removed the
 12522	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttransverse bar. Then he tried the various keys in the lock, but
 12523	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twithout success. No sound came from within, and at the silence
 12524	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHolmes' face clouded over.
 12525	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12526	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I trust that we are not too late," said he. "I think, Miss
 12527	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHunter, that we had better go in without you. Now, Watson, put
 12528	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyour shoulder to it, and we shall see whether we cannot make our
 12529	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tway in."
 12530	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12531	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tIt was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united
 12532	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstrength. Together we rushed into the room. It was empty. There
 12533	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas no furniture save a little pallet bed, a small table, and a
 12534	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbasketful of linen. The skylight above was open, and the prisoner
 12535	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tgone.
 12536	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12537	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"There has been some villainy here," said Holmes; "this beauty
 12538	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thas guessed Miss Hunter's intentions and has carried his victim
 12539	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\toff."
 12540	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12541	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But how?"
 12542	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12543	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Through the skylight. We shall soon see how he managed it." He
 12544	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tswung himself up onto the roof. "Ah, yes," he cried, "here's the
 12545	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tend of a long light ladder against the eaves. That is how he did
 12546	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit."
 12547	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12548	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But it is impossible," said Miss Hunter; "the ladder was not
 12549	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthere when the Rucastles went away."
 12550	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12551	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"He has come back and done it. I tell you that he is a clever and
 12552	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdangerous man. I should not be very much surprised if this were
 12553	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\the whose step I hear now upon the stair. I think, Watson, that it
 12554	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twould be as well for you to have your pistol ready."
 12555	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12556	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at
 12557	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe door of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy
 12558	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tstick in his hand. Miss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the
 12559	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twall at the sight of him, but Sherlock Holmes sprang forward and
 12560	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tconfronted him.
 12561	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12562	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You villain!" said he, "where's your daughter?"
 12563	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12564	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tThe fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open
 12565	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tskylight.
 12566	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12567	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"It is for me to ask you that," he shrieked, "you thieves! Spies
 12568	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tand thieves! I have caught you, have I? You are in my power. I'll
 12569	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tserve you!" He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he
 12570	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcould go.
 12571	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12572	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"He's gone for the dog!" cried Miss Hunter.
 12573	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12574	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I have my revolver," said I.
 12575	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12576	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Better close the front door," cried Holmes, and we all rushed
 12577	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdown the stairs together. We had hardly reached the hall when we
 12578	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\theard the baying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a
 12579	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thorrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to. An
 12580	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\telderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out
 12581	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tat a side door.
 12582	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12583	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"My God!" he cried. "Someone has loosed the dog. It's not been
 12584	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tfed for two days. Quick, quick, or it'll be too late!"
 12585	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12586	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHolmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with
 12587	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tToller hurrying behind us. There was the huge famished brute, its
 12588	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tblack muzzle buried in Rucastle's throat, while he writhed and
 12589	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tscreamed upon the ground. Running up, I blew its brains out, and
 12590	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tit fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great
 12591	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcreases of his neck. With much labour we separated them and
 12592	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcarried him, living but horribly mangled, into the house. We laid
 12593	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\thim upon the drawing-room sofa, and having dispatched the sobered
 12594	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tToller to bear the news to his wife, I did what I could to
 12595	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\trelieve his pain. We were all assembled round him when the door
 12596	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\topened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room.
 12597	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12598	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Mrs. Toller!" cried Miss Hunter.
 12599	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12600	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he came back before he
 12601	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twent up to you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn't let me know
 12602	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhat you were planning, for I would have told you that your pains
 12603	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twere wasted."
 12604	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12605	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Ha!" said Holmes, looking keenly at her. "It is clear that Mrs.
 12606	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tToller knows more about this matter than anyone else."
 12607	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12608	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know."
 12609	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12610	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several
 12611	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpoints on which I must confess that I am still in the dark."
 12612	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12613	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I will soon make it clear to you," said she; "and I'd have done
 12614	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tso before now if I could ha' got out from the cellar. If there's
 12615	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tpolice-court business over this, you'll remember that I was the
 12616	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tone that stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice's friend
 12617	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ttoo.
 12618	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12619	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"She was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn't, from the time

 12622	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tafter she met Mr. Fowler at a friend's house. As well as I could

 12624	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tquiet and patient, she was, that she never said a word about them

 12626	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsafe with her; but when there was a chance of a husband coming
 12627	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tforward, who would ask for all that the law would give him, then
 12628	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ther father thought it time to put a stop on it. He wanted her to
 12629	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsign a paper, so that whether she married or not, he could use
 12630	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\ther money. When she wouldn't do it, he kept on worrying her until
 12631	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshe got brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death's door. Then
 12632	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tshe got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her
 12633	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbeautiful hair cut off; but that didn't make no change in her
 12634	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyoung man, and he stuck to her as true as man could be."
 12635	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12636	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Ah," said Holmes, "I think that what you have been good enough
 12637	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tto tell us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce
 12638	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tall that remains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this
 12639	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tsystem of imprisonment?"
 12640	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12641	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Yes, sir."
 12642	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12643	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of
 12644	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe disagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler."
 12645	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12646	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"That was it, sir."
 12647	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12648	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"But Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should
 12649	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tbe, blockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain
 12650	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\targuments, metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your
 12651	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinterests were the same as his."
 12652	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12653	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"Mr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman," said
 12654	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tMrs. Toller serenely.
 12655	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12656	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"And in this way he managed that your good man should have no
 12657	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twant of drink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment
 12658	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twhen your master had gone out."
 12659	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12660	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"You have it, sir, just as it happened."
 12661	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12662	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t"I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller," said Holmes, "for
 12663	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tyou have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And
 12664	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\there comes the country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think,
 12665	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tWatson, that we had best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester,
 12666	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tas it seems to me that our locus standi now is rather a
 12667	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tquestionable one."
 12668	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\t
 12669	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tAnd thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the
 12670	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tcopper beeches in front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but
 12671	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\twas always a broken man, kept alive solely through the care of
 12672	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\this devoted wife. They still live with their old servants, who
 12673	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tprobably know so much of Rucastle's past life that he finds it
 12674	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tdifficult to part from them. Mr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle were
 12675	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tmarried, by special license, in Southampton the day after their
 12676	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tflight, and he is now the holder of a government appointment in
 12677	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tthe island of Mauritius. As to Miss Violet Hunter, my friend
 12678	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tHolmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no further
 12679	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tinterest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one
 12680	TheAdventuresofSherlockHolmesbyArthurConanDoyle.txt\tof his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at
