    85	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tChapter 1 PETER BREAKS THROUGH
    86	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
    87	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAll children, except one, grow up. They soon know that they will grow
    88	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tup, and the way Wendy knew was this. One day when she was two years old
    89	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tshe was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with
    90	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tit to her mother. I suppose she must have looked rather delightful, for
    91	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tMrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried, “Oh, why can’t you
    92	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tremain like this for ever!” This was all that passed between them on
    93	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe subject, but henceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up. You always
    94	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tknow after you are two. Two is the beginning of the end.
    95	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
    96	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tOf course they lived at 14 [their house number on their street], and
    97	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tuntil Wendy came her mother was the chief one. She was a lovely lady,
    98	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twith a romantic mind and such a sweet mocking mouth. Her romantic
    99	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmind was like the tiny boxes, one within the other, that come from the
   100	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tpuzzling East, however many you discover there is always one more; and
   101	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ther sweet mocking mouth had one kiss on it that Wendy could never get,
   102	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthough there it was, perfectly conspicuous in the right-hand corner.
   103	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   104	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe way Mr. Darling won her was this: the many gentlemen who had been
   105	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tboys when she was a girl discovered simultaneously that they loved her,
   106	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand they all ran to her house to propose to her except Mr. Darling, who
   107	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttook a cab and nipped in first, and so he got her. He got all of her,
   108	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\texcept the innermost box and the kiss. He never knew about the box, and
   109	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tin time he gave up trying for the kiss. Wendy thought Napoleon could
   110	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thave got it, but I can picture him trying, and then going off in a
   111	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tpassion, slamming the door.
   112	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   113	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tMr. Darling used to boast to Wendy that her mother not only loved him
   114	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbut respected him. He was one of those deep ones who know about stocks
   115	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand shares. Of course no one really knows, but he quite seemed to know,
   116	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand he often said stocks were up and shares were down in a way that
   117	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twould have made any woman respect him.
   118	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   119	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tMrs. Darling was married in white, and at first she kept the books
   120	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tperfectly, almost gleefully, as if it were a game, not so much as a
   121	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tBrussels sprout was missing; but by and by whole cauliflowers dropped
   122	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tout, and instead of them there were pictures of babies without faces.
   123	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tShe drew them when she should have been totting up. They were Mrs.
   124	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tDarling’s guesses.
   125	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   126	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWendy came first, then John, then Michael.
   127	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   128	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tFor a week or two after Wendy came it was doubtful whether they would
   129	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbe able to keep her, as she was another mouth to feed. Mr. Darling was
   130	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfrightfully proud of her, but he was very honourable, and he sat on the
   131	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tedge of Mrs. Darling’s bed, holding her hand and calculating expenses,
   132	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twhile she looked at him imploringly. She wanted to risk it, come what
   133	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmight, but that was not his way; his way was with a pencil and a piece
   134	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tof paper, and if she confused him with suggestions he had to begin at
   135	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe beginning again.
   136	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   137	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Now don’t interrupt,” he would beg of her.
   138	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   139	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I have one pound seventeen here, and two and six at the office; I can
   140	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcut off my coffee at the office, say ten shillings, making two nine
   141	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand six, with your eighteen and three makes three nine seven, with five
   142	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnaught naught in my cheque-book makes eight nine seven--who is that
   143	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmoving?--eight nine seven, dot and carry seven--don’t speak, my own--and
   144	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe pound you lent to that man who came to the door--quiet, child--dot
   145	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand carry child--there, you’ve done it!--did I say nine nine seven? yes,
   146	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tI said nine nine seven; the question is, can we try it for a year on
   147	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnine nine seven?”
   148	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   149	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Of course we can, George,” she cried. But she was prejudiced in Wendy’s
   150	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfavour, and he was really the grander character of the two.
   151	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   152	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Remember mumps,” he warned her almost threateningly, and off he went
   153	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tagain. “Mumps one pound, that is what I have put down, but I daresay
   154	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tit will be more like thirty shillings--don’t speak--measles one five,
   155	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tGerman measles half a guinea, makes two fifteen six--don’t waggle your
   156	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfinger--whooping-cough, say fifteen shillings”--and so on it went, and
   157	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tit added up differently each time; but at last Wendy just got through,
   158	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twith mumps reduced to twelve six, and the two kinds of measles treated
   159	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tas one.
   160	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   161	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThere was the same excitement over John, and Michael had even a narrower
   162	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsqueak; but both were kept, and soon, you might have seen the three of
   163	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthem going in a row to Miss Fulsom’s Kindergarten school, accompanied by
   164	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttheir nurse.
   165	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   166	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tMrs. Darling loved to have everything just so, and Mr. Darling had a
   167	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tpassion for being exactly like his neighbours; so, of course, they had
   168	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ta nurse. As they were poor, owing to the amount of milk the children
   169	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdrank, this nurse was a prim Newfoundland dog, called Nana, who had
   170	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbelonged to no one in particular until the Darlings engaged her. She had
   171	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\talways thought children important, however, and the Darlings had become
   172	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tacquainted with her in Kensington Gardens, where she spent most of her
   173	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tspare time peeping into perambulators, and was much hated by careless
   174	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnursemaids, whom she followed to their homes and complained of to their
   175	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmistresses. She proved to be quite a treasure of a nurse. How thorough
   176	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tshe was at bath-time, and up at any moment of the night if one of her
   177	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcharges made the slightest cry. Of course her kennel was in the nursery.
   178	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tShe had a genius for knowing when a cough is a thing to have no patience
   179	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twith and when it needs stocking around your throat. She believed to her
   180	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlast day in old-fashioned remedies like rhubarb leaf, and made sounds of
   181	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcontempt over all this new-fangled talk about germs, and so on. It was a
   182	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlesson in propriety to see her escorting the children to school, walking
   183	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsedately by their side when they were well behaved, and butting them
   184	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tback into line if they strayed. On John’s footer [in England soccer
   185	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twas called football, “footer” for short] days she never once forgot his
   186	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsweater, and she usually carried an umbrella in her mouth in case of
   187	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\train. There is a room in the basement of Miss Fulsom’s school where the
   188	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnurses wait. They sat on forms, while Nana lay on the floor, but that
   189	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twas the only difference. They affected to ignore her as of an inferior
   190	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsocial status to themselves, and she despised their light talk. She
   191	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tresented visits to the nursery from Mrs. Darling’s friends, but if they
   192	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdid come she first whipped off Michael’s pinafore and put him into the
   193	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tone with blue braiding, and smoothed out Wendy and made a dash at John’s
   194	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thair.
   195	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   196	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNo nursery could possibly have been conducted more correctly, and
   197	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tMr. Darling knew it, yet he sometimes wondered uneasily whether the
   198	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tneighbours talked.
   199	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   200	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe had his position in the city to consider.
   201	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   202	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNana also troubled him in another way. He had sometimes a feeling that
   203	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tshe did not admire him. “I know she admires you tremendously, George,”
   204	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t Mrs. Darling would assure him, and then she would sign to the children
   205	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tto be specially nice to father. Lovely dances followed, in which the
   206	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tonly other servant, Liza, was sometimes allowed to join. Such a midget
   207	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tshe looked in her long skirt and maid’s cap, though she had sworn, when
   208	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tengaged, that she would never see ten again. The gaiety of those romps!
   209	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAnd gayest of all was Mrs. Darling, who would pirouette so wildly that
   210	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tall you could see of her was the kiss, and then if you had dashed at her
   211	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tyou might have got it. There never was a simpler happier family until
   212	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe coming of Peter Pan.
   213	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   214	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tMrs. Darling first heard of Peter when she was tidying up her children’s
   215	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tminds. It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children
   216	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tare asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next
   217	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmorning, repacking into their proper places the many articles that have
   218	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twandered during the day. If you could keep awake (but of course you
   219	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcan’t) you would see your own mother doing this, and you would find it
   220	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tvery interesting to watch her. It is quite like tidying up drawers. You
   221	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twould see her on her knees, I expect, lingering humorously over some of
   222	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tyour contents, wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up,
   223	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmaking discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to her cheek as
   224	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tif it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of sight.
   225	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWhen you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions with
   226	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twhich you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom
   227	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tof your mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your
   228	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tprettier thoughts, ready for you to put on.
   229	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   230	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tI don’t know whether you have ever seen a map of a person’s mind.
   231	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tDoctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can
   232	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbecome intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a
   233	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tchild’s mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all
   234	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe time. There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a
   235	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcard, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is
   236	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\talways more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here
   237	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and
   238	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsavages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves
   239	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthrough which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a
   240	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked nose.
   241	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIt would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first day
   242	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tat school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders,
   243	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting
   244	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tinto braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth
   245	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tyourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or they are
   246	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tanother map showing through, and it is all rather confusing, especially
   247	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tas nothing will stand still.
   248	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   249	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tOf course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John’s, for instance, had a
   250	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while
   251	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tMichael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over
   252	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tit. John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in
   253	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ta wigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together. John had no
   254	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfriends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by
   255	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tits parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance,
   256	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have
   257	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\teach other’s nose, and so forth. On these magic shores children at play
   258	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tare for ever beaching their coracles [simple boat]. We too have been
   259	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthere; we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no
   260	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmore.
   261	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   262	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tOf all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most
   263	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcompact, not large and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances between
   264	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tone adventure and another, but nicely crammed. When you play at it by
   265	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tday with the chairs and table-cloth, it is not in the least alarming,
   266	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbut in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real. That
   267	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tis why there are night-lights.
   268	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   269	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tOccasionally in her travels through her children’s minds Mrs. Darling
   270	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfound things she could not understand, and of these quite the most
   271	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tperplexing was the word Peter. She knew of no Peter, and yet he was
   272	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\there and there in John and Michael’s minds, while Wendy’s began to be
   273	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tscrawled all over with him. The name stood out in bolder letters than
   274	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tany of the other words, and as Mrs. Darling gazed she felt that it had
   275	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tan oddly cocky appearance.
   276	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   277	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Yes, he is rather cocky,” Wendy admitted with regret. Her mother had
   278	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbeen questioning her.
   279	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   280	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“But who is he, my pet?”
   281	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   282	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“He is Peter Pan, you know, mother.”
   283	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   284	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAt first Mrs. Darling did not know, but after thinking back into her
   285	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tchildhood she just remembered a Peter Pan who was said to live with the
   286	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfairies. There were odd stories about him, as that when children died he
   287	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twent part of the way with them, so that they should not be frightened.
   288	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tShe had believed in him at the time, but now that she was married and
   289	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfull of sense she quite doubted whether there was any such person.
   290	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   291	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Besides,” she said to Wendy, “he would be grown up by this time.”
   292	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   293	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Oh no, he isn’t grown up,” Wendy assured her confidently, “and he is
   294	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tjust my size.” She meant that he was her size in both mind and body; she
   295	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdidn’t know how she knew, she just knew it.
   296	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   297	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tMrs. Darling consulted Mr. Darling, but he smiled pooh-pooh. “Mark my
   298	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twords,” he said, “it is some nonsense Nana has been putting into their
   299	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\theads; just the sort of idea a dog would have. Leave it alone, and it
   300	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twill blow over.”
   301	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   302	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tBut it would not blow over and soon the troublesome boy gave Mrs.
   303	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tDarling quite a shock.
   304	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   305	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tChildren have the strangest adventures without being troubled by them.
   306	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tFor instance, they may remember to mention, a week after the event
   307	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thappened, that when they were in the wood they had met their dead
   308	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfather and had a game with him. It was in this casual way that Wendy one
   309	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmorning made a disquieting revelation. Some leaves of a tree had been
   310	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfound on the nursery floor, which certainly were not there when the
   311	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tchildren went to bed, and Mrs. Darling was puzzling over them when Wendy
   312	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsaid with a tolerant smile:
   313	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   314	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I do believe it is that Peter again!”
   315	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   316	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Whatever do you mean, Wendy?”
   317	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   318	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“It is so naughty of him not to wipe his feet,” Wendy said, sighing. She
   319	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twas a tidy child.
   320	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   321	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tShe explained in quite a matter-of-fact way that she thought Peter
   322	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsometimes came to the nursery in the night and sat on the foot of her
   323	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbed and played on his pipes to her. Unfortunately she never woke, so she
   324	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdidn’t know how she knew, she just knew.
   325	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   326	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“What nonsense you talk, precious. No one can get into the house without
   327	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tknocking.”
   328	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   329	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I think he comes in by the window,” she said.
   330	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   331	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“My love, it is three floors up.”
   332	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   333	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Were not the leaves at the foot of the window, mother?”
   334	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   335	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIt was quite true; the leaves had been found very near the window.
   336	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   337	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tMrs. Darling did not know what to think, for it all seemed so natural to
   338	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWendy that you could not dismiss it by saying she had been dreaming.
   339	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   340	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“My child,” the mother cried, “why did you not tell me of this before?”
   341	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   342	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I forgot,” said Wendy lightly. She was in a hurry to get her breakfast.
   343	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   344	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tOh, surely she must have been dreaming.
   345	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   346	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tBut, on the other hand, there were the leaves. Mrs. Darling examined
   347	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthem very carefully; they were skeleton leaves, but she was sure they
   348	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdid not come from any tree that grew in England. She crawled about the
   349	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfloor, peering at it with a candle for marks of a strange foot. She
   350	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\trattled the poker up the chimney and tapped the walls. She let down a
   351	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttape from the window to the pavement, and it was a sheer drop of thirty
   352	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfeet, without so much as a spout to climb up by.
   353	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   354	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tCertainly Wendy had been dreaming.
   355	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   356	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tBut Wendy had not been dreaming, as the very next night showed, the
   357	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnight on which the extraordinary adventures of these children may be
   358	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsaid to have begun.
   359	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   360	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tOn the night we speak of all the children were once more in bed. It
   361	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thappened to be Nana’s evening off, and Mrs. Darling had bathed them and
   362	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsung to them till one by one they had let go her hand and slid away into
   363	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe land of sleep.
   364	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   365	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAll were looking so safe and cosy that she smiled at her fears now and
   366	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsat down tranquilly by the fire to sew.
   367	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   368	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIt was something for Michael, who on his birthday was getting into
   369	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tshirts. The fire was warm, however, and the nursery dimly lit by three
   370	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnight-lights, and presently the sewing lay on Mrs. Darling’s lap. Then
   371	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ther head nodded, oh, so gracefully. She was asleep. Look at the four of
   372	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthem, Wendy and Michael over there, John here, and Mrs. Darling by the
   373	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfire. There should have been a fourth night-light.
   374	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   375	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWhile she slept she had a dream. She dreamt that the Neverland had come
   376	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttoo near and that a strange boy had broken through from it. He did not
   377	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\talarm her, for she thought she had seen him before in the faces of many
   378	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twomen who have no children. Perhaps he is to be found in the faces of
   379	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsome mothers also. But in her dream he had rent the film that obscures
   380	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe Neverland, and she saw Wendy and John and Michael peeping through
   381	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe gap.
   382	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   383	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe dream by itself would have been a trifle, but while she was dreaming
   384	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe window of the nursery blew open, and a boy did drop on the floor.
   385	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe was accompanied by a strange light, no bigger than your fist, which
   386	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdarted about the room like a living thing and I think it must have been
   387	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthis light that wakened Mrs. Darling.
   388	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   389	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tShe started up with a cry, and saw the boy, and somehow she knew at once
   390	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthat he was Peter Pan. If you or I or Wendy had been there we should
   391	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thave seen that he was very like Mrs. Darling’s kiss. He was a lovely
   392	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tboy, clad in skeleton leaves and the juices that ooze out of trees but
   393	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe most entrancing thing about him was that he had all his first teeth.
   394	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWhen he saw she was a grown-up, he gnashed the little pearls at her.
   395	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   396	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   397	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   398	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   399	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tChapter 2 THE SHADOW
   400	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   401	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tMrs. Darling screamed, and, as if in answer to a bell, the door opened,
   402	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand Nana entered, returned from her evening out. She growled and sprang
   403	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tat the boy, who leapt lightly through the window. Again Mrs. Darling
   404	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tscreamed, this time in distress for him, for she thought he was killed,
   405	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand she ran down into the street to look for his little body, but it
   406	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twas not there; and she looked up, and in the black night she could see
   407	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnothing but what she thought was a shooting star.
   408	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   409	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tShe returned to the nursery, and found Nana with something in her mouth,
   410	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twhich proved to be the boy’s shadow. As he leapt at the window Nana had
   411	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tclosed it quickly, too late to catch him, but his shadow had not had
   412	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttime to get out; slam went the window and snapped it off.
   413	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   414	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tYou may be sure Mrs. Darling examined the shadow carefully, but it was
   415	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tquite the ordinary kind.
   416	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   417	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNana had no doubt of what was the best thing to do with this shadow. She
   418	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thung it out at the window, meaning “He is sure to come back for it; let
   419	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tus put it where he can get it easily without disturbing the children.”
   420	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   421	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tBut unfortunately Mrs. Darling could not leave it hanging out at the
   422	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twindow, it looked so like the washing and lowered the whole tone of the
   423	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thouse. She thought of showing it to Mr. Darling, but he was totting up
   424	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twinter great-coats for John and Michael, with a wet towel around his
   425	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thead to keep his brain clear, and it seemed a shame to trouble him;
   426	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbesides, she knew exactly what he would say: “It all comes of having a
   427	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdog for a nurse.”
   428	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   429	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tShe decided to roll the shadow up and put it away carefully in a drawer,
   430	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tuntil a fitting opportunity came for telling her husband. Ah me!
   431	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   432	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe opportunity came a week later, on that never-to-be-forgotten Friday.
   433	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tOf course it was a Friday.
   434	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   435	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I ought to have been specially careful on a Friday,” she used to say
   436	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tafterwards to her husband, while perhaps Nana was on the other side of
   437	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ther, holding her hand.
   438	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   439	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“No, no,” Mr. Darling always said, “I am responsible for it all. I,
   440	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tGeorge Darling, did it. MEA CULPA, MEA CULPA.” He had had a classical
   441	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\teducation.
   442	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   443	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThey sat thus night after night recalling that fatal Friday, till every
   444	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdetail of it was stamped on their brains and came through on the other
   445	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tside like the faces on a bad coinage.
   446	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   447	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“If only I had not accepted that invitation to dine at 27,” Mrs. Darling
   448	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsaid.
   449	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   450	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“If only I had not poured my medicine into Nana’s bowl,” said Mr.
   451	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tDarling.
   452	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   453	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“If only I had pretended to like the medicine,” was what Nana’s wet eyes
   454	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsaid.
   455	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   456	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“My liking for parties, George.”
   457	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   458	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“My fatal gift of humour, dearest.”
   459	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   460	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“My touchiness about trifles, dear master and mistress.”
   461	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   462	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThen one or more of them would break down altogether; Nana at the
   463	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthought, “It’s true, it’s true, they ought not to have had a dog for
   464	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ta nurse.” Many a time it was Mr. Darling who put the handkerchief to
   465	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNana’s eyes.
   466	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   467	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“That fiend!” Mr. Darling would cry, and Nana’s bark was the echo of
   468	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tit, but Mrs. Darling never upbraided Peter; there was something in the
   469	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tright-hand corner of her mouth that wanted her not to call Peter names.
   470	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   471	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThey would sit there in the empty nursery, recalling fondly every
   472	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsmallest detail of that dreadful evening. It had begun so uneventfully,
   473	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tso precisely like a hundred other evenings, with Nana putting on the
   474	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twater for Michael’s bath and carrying him to it on her back.
   475	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   476	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I won’t go to bed,” he had shouted, like one who still believed that he
   477	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thad the last word on the subject, “I won’t, I won’t. Nana, it isn’t six
   478	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\to’clock yet. Oh dear, oh dear, I shan’t love you any more, Nana. I tell
   479	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tyou I won’t be bathed, I won’t, I won’t!”
   480	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   481	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThen Mrs. Darling had come in, wearing her white evening-gown. She had
   482	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdressed early because Wendy so loved to see her in her evening-gown,
   483	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twith the necklace George had given her. She was wearing Wendy’s bracelet
   484	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ton her arm; she had asked for the loan of it. Wendy loved to lend her
   485	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbracelet to her mother.
   486	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   487	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tShe had found her two older children playing at being herself and father
   488	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ton the occasion of Wendy’s birth, and John was saying:
   489	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   490	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I am happy to inform you, Mrs. Darling, that you are now a mother,”
   491	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t in just such a tone as Mr. Darling himself may have used on the real
   492	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\toccasion.
   493	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   494	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWendy had danced with joy, just as the real Mrs. Darling must have done.
   495	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   496	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThen John was born, with the extra pomp that he conceived due to the
   497	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbirth of a male, and Michael came from his bath to ask to be born also,
   498	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbut John said brutally that they did not want any more.
   499	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   500	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tMichael had nearly cried. “Nobody wants me,” he said, and of course the
   501	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlady in the evening-dress could not stand that.
   502	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   503	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I do,” she said, “I so want a third child.”
   504	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   505	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Boy or girl?” asked Michael, not too hopefully.
   506	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   507	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Boy.”
   508	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   509	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThen he had leapt into her arms. Such a little thing for Mr. and Mrs.
   510	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tDarling and Nana to recall now, but not so little if that was to be
   511	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tMichael’s last night in the nursery.
   512	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   513	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThey go on with their recollections.
   514	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   515	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“It was then that I rushed in like a tornado, wasn’t it?” Mr. Darling
   516	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twould say, scorning himself; and indeed he had been like a tornado.
   517	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   518	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPerhaps there was some excuse for him. He, too, had been dressing for
   519	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe party, and all had gone well with him until he came to his tie. It
   520	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tis an astounding thing to have to tell, but this man, though he knew
   521	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tabout stocks and shares, had no real mastery of his tie. Sometimes the
   522	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthing yielded to him without a contest, but there were occasions when it
   523	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twould have been better for the house if he had swallowed his pride and
   524	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tused a made-up tie.
   525	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   526	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThis was such an occasion. He came rushing into the nursery with the
   527	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcrumpled little brute of a tie in his hand.
   528	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   529	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Why, what is the matter, father dear?”
   530	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   531	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Matter!” he yelled; he really yelled. “This tie, it will not tie.” He
   532	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbecame dangerously sarcastic. “Not round my neck! Round the bed-post!
   533	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tOh yes, twenty times have I made it up round the bed-post, but round my
   534	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tneck, no! Oh dear no! begs to be excused!”
   535	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   536	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe thought Mrs. Darling was not sufficiently impressed, and he went on
   537	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsternly, “I warn you of this, mother, that unless this tie is round my
   538	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tneck we don’t go out to dinner to-night, and if I don’t go out to dinner
   539	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tto-night, I never go to the office again, and if I don’t go to the
   540	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\toffice again, you and I starve, and our children will be flung into the
   541	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tstreets.”
   542	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   543	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tEven then Mrs. Darling was placid. “Let me try, dear,” she said, and
   544	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tindeed that was what he had come to ask her to do, and with her nice
   545	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcool hands she tied his tie for him, while the children stood around to
   546	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsee their fate decided. Some men would have resented her being able to
   547	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdo it so easily, but Mr. Darling had far too fine a nature for that; he
   548	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthanked her carelessly, at once forgot his rage, and in another moment
   549	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twas dancing round the room with Michael on his back.
   550	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   551	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“How wildly we romped!” says Mrs. Darling now, recalling it.
   552	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   553	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Our last romp!” Mr. Darling groaned.
   554	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   555	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“O George, do you remember Michael suddenly said to me, ‘How did you get
   556	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tto know me, mother?’”
   557	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   558	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I remember!”
   559	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   560	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“They were rather sweet, don’t you think, George?”
   561	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   562	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“And they were ours, ours! and now they are gone.”
   563	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   564	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe romp had ended with the appearance of Nana, and most unluckily Mr.
   565	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tDarling collided against her, covering his trousers with hairs. They
   566	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twere not only new trousers, but they were the first he had ever had
   567	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twith braid on them, and he had had to bite his lip to prevent the tears
   568	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcoming. Of course Mrs. Darling brushed him, but he began to talk again
   569	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tabout its being a mistake to have a dog for a nurse.
   570	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   571	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“George, Nana is a treasure.”
   572	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   573	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“No doubt, but I have an uneasy feeling at times that she looks upon the
   574	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tchildren as puppies.”
   575	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   576	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Oh no, dear one, I feel sure she knows they have souls.”
   577	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   578	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I wonder,” Mr. Darling said thoughtfully, “I wonder.” It was an
   579	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\topportunity, his wife felt, for telling him about the boy. At first he
   580	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tpooh-poohed the story, but he became thoughtful when she showed him the
   581	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tshadow.
   582	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   583	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“It is nobody I know,” he said, examining it carefully, “but it does
   584	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlook a scoundrel.”
   585	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   586	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“We were still discussing it, you remember,” says Mr. Darling, “when
   587	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNana came in with Michael’s medicine. You will never carry the bottle in
   588	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tyour mouth again, Nana, and it is all my fault.”
   589	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   590	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tStrong man though he was, there is no doubt that he had behaved rather
   591	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfoolishly over the medicine. If he had a weakness, it was for thinking
   592	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthat all his life he had taken medicine boldly, and so now, when Michael
   593	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdodged the spoon in Nana’s mouth, he had said reprovingly, “Be a man,
   594	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tMichael.”
   595	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   596	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Won’t; won’t!” Michael cried naughtily. Mrs. Darling left the room to
   597	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tget a chocolate for him, and Mr. Darling thought this showed want of
   598	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfirmness.
   599	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   600	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Mother, don’t pamper him,” he called after her. “Michael, when I was
   601	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tyour age I took medicine without a murmur. I said, ‘Thank you, kind
   602	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tparents, for giving me bottles to make me well.’”
   603	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   604	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe really thought this was true, and Wendy, who was now in her
   605	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnight-gown, believed it also, and she said, to encourage Michael, “That
   606	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmedicine you sometimes take, father, is much nastier, isn’t it?”
   607	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   608	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Ever so much nastier,” Mr. Darling said bravely, “and I would take it
   609	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnow as an example to you, Michael, if I hadn’t lost the bottle.”
   610	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   611	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe had not exactly lost it; he had climbed in the dead of night to the
   612	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttop of the wardrobe and hidden it there. What he did not know was that
   613	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe faithful Liza had found it, and put it back on his wash-stand.
   614	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   615	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I know where it is, father,” Wendy cried, always glad to be of service.
   616	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I’ll bring it,” and she was off before he could stop her. Immediately
   617	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\this spirits sank in the strangest way.
   618	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   619	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“John,” he said, shuddering, “it’s most beastly stuff. It’s that nasty,
   620	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsticky, sweet kind.”
   621	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   622	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“It will soon be over, father,” John said cheerily, and then in rushed
   623	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWendy with the medicine in a glass.
   624	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   625	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I have been as quick as I could,” she panted.
   626	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   627	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“You have been wonderfully quick,” her father retorted, with a
   628	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tvindictive politeness that was quite thrown away upon her. “Michael
   629	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfirst,” he said doggedly.
   630	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   631	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Father first,” said Michael, who was of a suspicious nature.
   632	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   633	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I shall be sick, you know,” Mr. Darling said threateningly.
   634	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   635	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Come on, father,” said John.
   636	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   637	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Hold your tongue, John,” his father rapped out.
   638	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   639	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWendy was quite puzzled. “I thought you took it quite easily, father.”
   640	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   641	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“That is not the point,” he retorted. “The point is, that there is
   642	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmore in my glass than in Michael’s spoon.” His proud heart was nearly
   643	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbursting. “And it isn’t fair: I would say it though it were with my last
   644	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbreath; it isn’t fair.”
   645	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   646	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Father, I am waiting,” said Michael coldly.
   647	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   648	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“It’s all very well to say you are waiting; so am I waiting.”
   649	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   650	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Father’s a cowardly custard.”
   651	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   652	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“So are you a cowardly custard.”
   653	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   654	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I’m not frightened.”
   655	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   656	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Neither am I frightened.”
   657	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   658	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Well, then, take it.”
   659	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   660	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Well, then, you take it.”
   661	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   662	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWendy had a splendid idea. “Why not both take it at the same time?”
   663	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   664	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Certainly,” said Mr. Darling. “Are you ready, Michael?”
   665	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   666	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWendy gave the words, one, two, three, and Michael took his medicine,
   667	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbut Mr. Darling slipped his behind his back.
   668	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   669	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThere was a yell of rage from Michael, and “O father!” Wendy exclaimed.
   670	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   671	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“What do you mean by ‘O father’?” Mr. Darling demanded. “Stop that row,
   672	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tMichael. I meant to take mine, but I--I missed it.”
   673	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   674	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIt was dreadful the way all the three were looking at him, just as if
   675	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthey did not admire him. “Look here, all of you,” he said entreatingly,
   676	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tas soon as Nana had gone into the bathroom. “I have just thought of a
   677	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsplendid joke. I shall pour my medicine into Nana’s bowl, and she will
   678	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdrink it, thinking it is milk!”
   679	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   680	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIt was the colour of milk; but the children did not have their father’s
   681	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsense of humour, and they looked at him reproachfully as he poured the
   682	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmedicine into Nana’s bowl. “What fun!” he said doubtfully, and they did
   683	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnot dare expose him when Mrs. Darling and Nana returned.
   684	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   685	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Nana, good dog,” he said, patting her, “I have put a little milk into
   686	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tyour bowl, Nana.”
   687	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   688	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNana wagged her tail, ran to the medicine, and began lapping it. Then
   689	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tshe gave Mr. Darling such a look, not an angry look: she showed him the
   690	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tgreat red tear that makes us so sorry for noble dogs, and crept into her
   691	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tkennel.
   692	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   693	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tMr. Darling was frightfully ashamed of himself, but he would not give
   694	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tin. In a horrid silence Mrs. Darling smelt the bowl. “O George,” she
   695	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsaid, “it’s your medicine!”
   696	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   697	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“It was only a joke,” he roared, while she comforted her boys, and Wendy
   698	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thugged Nana. “Much good,” he said bitterly, “my wearing myself to the
   699	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbone trying to be funny in this house.”
   700	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   701	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAnd still Wendy hugged Nana. “That’s right,” he shouted. “Coddle her!
   702	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNobody coddles me. Oh dear no! I am only the breadwinner, why should I
   703	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbe coddled--why, why, why!”
   704	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   705	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“George,” Mrs. Darling entreated him, “not so loud; the servants
   706	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twill hear you.” Somehow they had got into the way of calling Liza the
   707	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tservants.
   708	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   709	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Let them!” he answered recklessly. “Bring in the whole world. But I
   710	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\trefuse to allow that dog to lord it in my nursery for an hour longer.”
   711	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   712	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe children wept, and Nana ran to him beseechingly, but he waved her
   713	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tback. He felt he was a strong man again. “In vain, in vain,” he cried;
   714	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“the proper place for you is the yard, and there you go to be tied up
   715	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthis instant.”
   716	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   717	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“George, George,” Mrs. Darling whispered, “remember what I told you
   718	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tabout that boy.”
   719	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   720	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAlas, he would not listen. He was determined to show who was master in
   721	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthat house, and when commands would not draw Nana from the kennel, he
   722	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlured her out of it with honeyed words, and seizing her roughly, dragged
   723	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ther from the nursery. He was ashamed of himself, and yet he did it.
   724	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIt was all owing to his too affectionate nature, which craved for
   725	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tadmiration. When he had tied her up in the back-yard, the wretched
   726	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfather went and sat in the passage, with his knuckles to his eyes.
   727	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   728	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIn the meantime Mrs. Darling had put the children to bed in unwonted
   729	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsilence and lit their night-lights. They could hear Nana barking, and
   730	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tJohn whimpered, “It is because he is chaining her up in the yard,” but
   731	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWendy was wiser.
   732	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   733	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“That is not Nana’s unhappy bark,” she said, little guessing what was
   734	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tabout to happen; “that is her bark when she smells danger.”
   735	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   736	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tDanger!
   737	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   738	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Are you sure, Wendy?”
   739	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   740	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Oh, yes.”
   741	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   742	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tMrs. Darling quivered and went to the window. It was securely fastened.
   743	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tShe looked out, and the night was peppered with stars. They were
   744	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcrowding round the house, as if curious to see what was to take place
   745	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthere, but she did not notice this, nor that one or two of the smaller
   746	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tones winked at her. Yet a nameless fear clutched at her heart and made
   747	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ther cry, “Oh, how I wish that I wasn’t going to a party to-night!”
   748	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   749	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tEven Michael, already half asleep, knew that she was perturbed, and he
   750	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tasked, “Can anything harm us, mother, after the night-lights are lit?”
   751	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   752	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Nothing, precious,” she said; “they are the eyes a mother leaves behind
   753	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ther to guard her children.”
   754	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   755	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tShe went from bed to bed singing enchantments over them, and little
   756	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tMichael flung his arms round her. “Mother,” he cried, “I’m glad of you.”
   757	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t They were the last words she was to hear from him for a long time.
   758	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   759	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNo. 27 was only a few yards distant, but there had been a slight fall of
   760	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsnow, and Father and Mother Darling picked their way over it deftly not
   761	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tto soil their shoes. They were already the only persons in the street,
   762	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand all the stars were watching them. Stars are beautiful, but they may
   763	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnot take an active part in anything, they must just look on for ever. It
   764	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tis a punishment put on them for something they did so long ago that no
   765	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tstar now knows what it was. So the older ones have become glassy-eyed
   766	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand seldom speak (winking is the star language), but the little
   767	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tones still wonder. They are not really friendly to Peter, who had a
   768	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmischievous way of stealing up behind them and trying to blow them out;
   769	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbut they are so fond of fun that they were on his side to-night, and
   770	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tanxious to get the grown-ups out of the way. So as soon as the door
   771	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tof 27 closed on Mr. and Mrs. Darling there was a commotion in the
   772	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfirmament, and the smallest of all the stars in the Milky Way screamed
   773	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tout:
   774	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   775	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Now, Peter!”
   776	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   777	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   778	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   779	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   780	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tChapter 3 COME AWAY, COME AWAY!
   781	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   782	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tFor a moment after Mr. and Mrs. Darling left the house the night-lights
   783	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tby the beds of the three children continued to burn clearly. They were
   784	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tawfully nice little night-lights, and one cannot help wishing that they
   785	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcould have kept awake to see Peter; but Wendy’s light blinked and gave
   786	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsuch a yawn that the other two yawned also, and before they could close
   787	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttheir mouths all the three went out.
   788	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   789	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThere was another light in the room now, a thousand times brighter than
   790	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe night-lights, and in the time we have taken to say this, it had been
   791	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tin all the drawers in the nursery, looking for Peter’s shadow, rummaged
   792	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe wardrobe and turned every pocket inside out. It was not really a
   793	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlight; it made this light by flashing about so quickly, but when it came
   794	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tto rest for a second you saw it was a fairy, no longer than your hand,
   795	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbut still growing. It was a girl called Tinker Bell exquisitely gowned
   796	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tin a skeleton leaf, cut low and square, through which her figure could
   797	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbe seen to the best advantage. She was slightly inclined to EMBONPOINT.
   798	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t[plump hourglass figure]
   799	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   800	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tA moment after the fairy’s entrance the window was blown open by the
   801	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbreathing of the little stars, and Peter dropped in. He had carried
   802	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tTinker Bell part of the way, and his hand was still messy with the fairy
   803	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdust.
   804	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   805	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Tinker Bell,” he called softly, after making sure that the children
   806	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twere asleep, “Tink, where are you?” She was in a jug for the moment, and
   807	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tliking it extremely; she had never been in a jug before.
   808	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   809	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Oh, do come out of that jug, and tell me, do you know where they put my
   810	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tshadow?”
   811	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   812	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe loveliest tinkle as of golden bells answered him. It is the fairy
   813	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlanguage. You ordinary children can never hear it, but if you were to
   814	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thear it you would know that you had heard it once before.
   815	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   816	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tTink said that the shadow was in the big box. She meant the chest of
   817	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdrawers, and Peter jumped at the drawers, scattering their contents to
   818	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe floor with both hands, as kings toss ha’pence to the crowd. In a
   819	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmoment he had recovered his shadow, and in his delight he forgot that he
   820	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thad shut Tinker Bell up in the drawer.
   821	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   822	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIf he thought at all, but I don’t believe he ever thought, it was that
   823	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\the and his shadow, when brought near each other, would join like drops
   824	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tof water, and when they did not he was appalled. He tried to stick it
   825	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ton with soap from the bathroom, but that also failed. A shudder passed
   826	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthrough Peter, and he sat on the floor and cried.
   827	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   828	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHis sobs woke Wendy, and she sat up in bed. She was not alarmed to see
   829	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ta stranger crying on the nursery floor; she was only pleasantly
   830	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tinterested.
   831	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   832	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Boy,” she said courteously, “why are you crying?”
   833	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   834	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPeter could be exceeding polite also, having learned the grand manner at
   835	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfairy ceremonies, and he rose and bowed to her beautifully. She was much
   836	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tpleased, and bowed beautifully to him from the bed.
   837	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   838	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“What’s your name?” he asked.
   839	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   840	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Wendy Moira Angela Darling,” she replied with some satisfaction. “What
   841	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tis your name?”
   842	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   843	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Peter Pan.”
   844	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   845	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tShe was already sure that he must be Peter, but it did seem a
   846	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcomparatively short name.
   847	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   848	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Is that all?”
   849	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   850	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Yes,” he said rather sharply. He felt for the first time that it was a
   851	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tshortish name.
   852	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   853	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I’m so sorry,” said Wendy Moira Angela.
   854	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   855	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“It doesn’t matter,” Peter gulped.
   856	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   857	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tShe asked where he lived.
   858	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   859	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Second to the right,” said Peter, “and then straight on till morning.”
   860	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   861	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“What a funny address!”
   862	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   863	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPeter had a sinking. For the first time he felt that perhaps it was a
   864	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfunny address.
   865	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   866	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“No, it isn’t,” he said.
   867	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   868	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I mean,” Wendy said nicely, remembering that she was hostess, “is that
   869	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twhat they put on the letters?”
   870	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   871	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe wished she had not mentioned letters.
   872	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   873	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Don’t get any letters,” he said contemptuously.
   874	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   875	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“But your mother gets letters?”
   876	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   877	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Don’t have a mother,” he said. Not only had he no mother, but he had
   878	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnot the slightest desire to have one. He thought them very over-rated
   879	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tpersons. Wendy, however, felt at once that she was in the presence of a
   880	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttragedy.
   881	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   882	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“O Peter, no wonder you were crying,” she said, and got out of bed and
   883	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tran to him.
   884	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   885	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I wasn’t crying about mothers,” he said rather indignantly. “I was
   886	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcrying because I can’t get my shadow to stick on. Besides, I wasn’t
   887	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcrying.”
   888	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   889	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“It has come off?”
   890	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   891	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Yes.”
   892	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   893	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThen Wendy saw the shadow on the floor, looking so draggled, and she was
   894	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfrightfully sorry for Peter. “How awful!” she said, but she could not
   895	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thelp smiling when she saw that he had been trying to stick it on with
   896	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsoap. How exactly like a boy!
   897	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   898	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tFortunately she knew at once what to do. “It must be sewn on,” she said,
   899	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tjust a little patronisingly.
   900	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   901	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“What’s sewn?” he asked.
   902	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   903	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“You’re dreadfully ignorant.”
   904	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   905	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“No, I’m not.”
   906	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   907	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tBut she was exulting in his ignorance. “I shall sew it on for you, my
   908	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlittle man,” she said, though he was tall as herself, and she got out
   909	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ther housewife [sewing bag], and sewed the shadow on to Peter’s foot.
   910	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   911	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I daresay it will hurt a little,” she warned him.
   912	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   913	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Oh, I shan’t cry,” said Peter, who was already of the opinion that he
   914	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thad never cried in his life. And he clenched his teeth and did not
   915	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcry, and soon his shadow was behaving properly, though still a little
   916	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcreased.
   917	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   918	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Perhaps I should have ironed it,” Wendy said thoughtfully, but Peter,
   919	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tboylike, was indifferent to appearances, and he was now jumping about in
   920	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe wildest glee. Alas, he had already forgotten that he owed his bliss
   921	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tto Wendy. He thought he had attached the shadow himself. “How clever I
   922	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tam!” he crowed rapturously, “oh, the cleverness of me!”
   923	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   924	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIt is humiliating to have to confess that this conceit of Peter was
   925	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tone of his most fascinating qualities. To put it with brutal frankness,
   926	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthere never was a cockier boy.
   927	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   928	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tBut for the moment Wendy was shocked. “You conceit [braggart],” she
   929	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\texclaimed, with frightful sarcasm; “of course I did nothing!”
   930	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   931	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“You did a little,” Peter said carelessly, and continued to dance.
   932	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   933	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“A little!” she replied with hauteur [pride]; “if I am no use I can at
   934	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tleast withdraw,” and she sprang in the most dignified way into bed and
   935	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcovered her face with the blankets.
   936	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   937	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tTo induce her to look up he pretended to be going away, and when this
   938	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfailed he sat on the end of the bed and tapped her gently with his foot.
   939	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Wendy,” he said, “don’t withdraw. I can’t help crowing, Wendy, when
   940	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tI’m pleased with myself.” Still she would not look up, though she was
   941	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlistening eagerly. “Wendy,” he continued, in a voice that no woman has
   942	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tever yet been able to resist, “Wendy, one girl is more use than twenty
   943	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tboys.”
   944	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   945	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNow Wendy was every inch a woman, though there were not very many
   946	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tinches, and she peeped out of the bed-clothes.
   947	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   948	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Do you really think so, Peter?”
   949	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   950	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Yes, I do.”
   951	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   952	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I think it’s perfectly sweet of you,” she declared, “and I’ll get up
   953	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tagain,” and she sat with him on the side of the bed. She also said
   954	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tshe would give him a kiss if he liked, but Peter did not know what she
   955	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmeant, and he held out his hand expectantly.
   956	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   957	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Surely you know what a kiss is?” she asked, aghast.
   958	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   959	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I shall know when you give it to me,” he replied stiffly, and not to
   960	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thurt his feeling she gave him a thimble.
   961	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   962	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Now,” said he, “shall I give you a kiss?” and she replied with a slight
   963	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tprimness, “If you please.” She made herself rather cheap by inclining
   964	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ther face toward him, but he merely dropped an acorn button into her
   965	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thand, so she slowly returned her face to where it had been before, and
   966	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsaid nicely that she would wear his kiss on the chain around her neck.
   967	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIt was lucky that she did put it on that chain, for it was afterwards to
   968	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsave her life.
   969	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   970	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWhen people in our set are introduced, it is customary for them to
   971	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\task each other’s age, and so Wendy, who always liked to do the correct
   972	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthing, asked Peter how old he was. It was not really a happy question to
   973	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\task him; it was like an examination paper that asks grammar, when what
   974	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tyou want to be asked is Kings of England.
   975	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   976	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I don’t know,” he replied uneasily, “but I am quite young.” He really
   977	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tknew nothing about it, he had merely suspicions, but he said at a
   978	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tventure, “Wendy, I ran away the day I was born.”
   979	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   980	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWendy was quite surprised, but interested; and she indicated in the
   981	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcharming drawing-room manner, by a touch on her night-gown, that he
   982	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcould sit nearer her.
   983	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   984	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“It was because I heard father and mother,” he explained in a low
   985	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tvoice, “talking about what I was to be when I became a man.” He was
   986	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\textraordinarily agitated now. “I don’t want ever to be a man,” he said
   987	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twith passion. “I want always to be a little boy and to have fun. So
   988	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tI ran away to Kensington Gardens and lived a long long time among the
   989	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfairies.”
   990	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   991	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tShe gave him a look of the most intense admiration, and he thought it
   992	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twas because he had run away, but it was really because he knew fairies.
   993	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWendy had lived such a home life that to know fairies struck her as
   994	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tquite delightful. She poured out questions about them, to his surprise,
   995	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfor they were rather a nuisance to him, getting in his way and so on,
   996	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand indeed he sometimes had to give them a hiding [spanking]. Still, he
   997	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tliked them on the whole, and he told her about the beginning of fairies.
   998	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
   999	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“You see, Wendy, when the first baby laughed for the first time, its
  1000	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlaugh broke into a thousand pieces, and they all went skipping about,
  1001	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand that was the beginning of fairies.”
  1002	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1003	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tTedious talk this, but being a stay-at-home she liked it.
  1004	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1005	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“And so,” he went on good-naturedly, “there ought to be one fairy for
  1006	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tevery boy and girl.”
  1007	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1008	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Ought to be? Isn’t there?”
  1009	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1010	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“No. You see children know such a lot now, they soon don’t believe in
  1011	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfairies, and every time a child says, ‘I don’t believe in fairies,’
  1012	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthere is a fairy somewhere that falls down dead.”
  1013	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1014	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tReally, he thought they had now talked enough about fairies, and it
  1015	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tstruck him that Tinker Bell was keeping very quiet. “I can’t think where
  1016	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tshe has gone to,” he said, rising, and he called Tink by name. Wendy’s
  1017	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\theart went flutter with a sudden thrill.
  1018	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1019	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Peter,” she cried, clutching him, “you don’t mean to tell me that there
  1020	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tis a fairy in this room!”
  1021	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1022	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“She was here just now,” he said a little impatiently. “You don’t hear
  1023	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ther, do you?” and they both listened.
  1024	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1025	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“The only sound I hear,” said Wendy, “is like a tinkle of bells.”
  1026	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1027	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Well, that’s Tink, that’s the fairy language. I think I hear her too.”
  1028	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1029	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe sound came from the chest of drawers, and Peter made a merry face.
  1030	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNo one could ever look quite so merry as Peter, and the loveliest of
  1031	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tgurgles was his laugh. He had his first laugh still.
  1032	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1033	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Wendy,” he whispered gleefully, “I do believe I shut her up in the
  1034	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdrawer!”
  1035	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1036	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe let poor Tink out of the drawer, and she flew about the nursery
  1037	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tscreaming with fury. “You shouldn’t say such things,” Peter retorted.
  1038	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Of course I’m very sorry, but how could I know you were in the drawer?”
  1039	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1040	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWendy was not listening to him. “O Peter,” she cried, “if she would only
  1041	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tstand still and let me see her!”
  1042	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1043	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“They hardly ever stand still,” he said, but for one moment Wendy saw
  1044	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe romantic figure come to rest on the cuckoo clock. “O the lovely!”
  1045	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t she cried, though Tink’s face was still distorted with passion.
  1046	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1047	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Tink,” said Peter amiably, “this lady says she wishes you were her
  1048	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfairy.”
  1049	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1050	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tTinker Bell answered insolently.
  1051	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1052	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“What does she say, Peter?”
  1053	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1054	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe had to translate. “She is not very polite. She says you are a great
  1055	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t[huge] ugly girl, and that she is my fairy.”
  1056	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1057	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe tried to argue with Tink. “You know you can’t be my fairy, Tink,
  1058	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbecause I am an gentleman and you are a lady.”
  1059	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1060	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tTo this Tink replied in these words, “You silly ass,” and disappeared
  1061	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tinto the bathroom. “She is quite a common fairy,” Peter explained
  1062	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tapologetically, “she is called Tinker Bell because she mends the pots
  1063	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand kettles [tinker = tin worker].” [Similar to “cinder” plus “elle” to
  1064	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tget Cinderella]
  1065	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1066	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThey were together in the armchair by this time, and Wendy plied him
  1067	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twith more questions.
  1068	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1069	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“If you don’t live in Kensington Gardens now--”
  1070	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1071	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Sometimes I do still.”
  1072	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1073	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“But where do you live mostly now?”
  1074	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1075	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“With the lost boys.”
  1076	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1077	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Who are they?”
  1078	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1079	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“They are the children who fall out of their perambulators when the
  1080	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnurse is looking the other way. If they are not claimed in seven
  1081	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdays they are sent far away to the Neverland to defray expenses. I’m
  1082	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcaptain.”
  1083	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1084	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“What fun it must be!”
  1085	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1086	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Yes,” said cunning Peter, “but we are rather lonely. You see we have no
  1087	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfemale companionship.”
  1088	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1089	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Are none of the others girls?”
  1090	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1091	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Oh, no; girls, you know, are much too clever to fall out of their
  1092	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tprams.”
  1093	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1094	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThis flattered Wendy immensely. “I think,” she said, “it is perfectly
  1095	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlovely the way you talk about girls; John there just despises us.”
  1096	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1097	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tFor reply Peter rose and kicked John out of bed, blankets and all; one
  1098	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tkick. This seemed to Wendy rather forward for a first meeting, and she
  1099	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttold him with spirit that he was not captain in her house. However,
  1100	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tJohn continued to sleep so placidly on the floor that she allowed him
  1101	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tto remain there. “And I know you meant to be kind,” she said, relenting,
  1102	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“so you may give me a kiss.”
  1103	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1104	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tFor the moment she had forgotten his ignorance about kisses. “I thought
  1105	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tyou would want it back,” he said a little bitterly, and offered to
  1106	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\treturn her the thimble.
  1107	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1108	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Oh dear,” said the nice Wendy, “I don’t mean a kiss, I mean a thimble.”
  1109	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1110	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“What’s that?”
  1111	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1112	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“It’s like this.” She kissed him.
  1113	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1114	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Funny!” said Peter gravely. “Now shall I give you a thimble?”
  1115	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1116	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“If you wish to,” said Wendy, keeping her head erect this time.
  1117	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1118	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPeter thimbled her, and almost immediately she screeched. “What is it,
  1119	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWendy?”
  1120	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1121	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“It was exactly as if someone were pulling my hair.”
  1122	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1123	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“That must have been Tink. I never knew her so naughty before.”
  1124	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1125	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAnd indeed Tink was darting about again, using offensive language.
  1126	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1127	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“She says she will do that to you, Wendy, every time I give you a
  1128	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthimble.”
  1129	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1130	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“But why?”
  1131	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1132	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Why, Tink?”
  1133	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1134	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAgain Tink replied, “You silly ass.” Peter could not understand why,
  1135	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbut Wendy understood, and she was just slightly disappointed when he
  1136	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tadmitted that he came to the nursery window not to see her but to listen
  1137	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tto stories.
  1138	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1139	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“You see, I don’t know any stories. None of the lost boys knows any
  1140	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tstories.”
  1141	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1142	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“How perfectly awful,” Wendy said.
  1143	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1144	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Do you know,” Peter asked “why swallows build in the eaves of houses?
  1145	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIt is to listen to the stories. O Wendy, your mother was telling you
  1146	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsuch a lovely story.”
  1147	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1148	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Which story was it?”
  1149	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1150	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“About the prince who couldn’t find the lady who wore the glass
  1151	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tslipper.”
  1152	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1153	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Peter,” said Wendy excitedly, “that was Cinderella, and he found her,
  1154	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand they lived happily ever after.”
  1155	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1156	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPeter was so glad that he rose from the floor, where they had been
  1157	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsitting, and hurried to the window.
  1158	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1159	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Where are you going?” she cried with misgiving.
  1160	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1161	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“To tell the other boys.”
  1162	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1163	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Don’t go Peter,” she entreated, “I know such lots of stories.”
  1164	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1165	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThose were her precise words, so there can be no denying that it was she
  1166	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twho first tempted him.
  1167	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1168	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe came back, and there was a greedy look in his eyes now which ought to
  1169	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thave alarmed her, but did not.
  1170	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1171	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Oh, the stories I could tell to the boys!” she cried, and then Peter
  1172	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tgripped her and began to draw her toward the window.
  1173	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1174	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Let me go!” she ordered him.
  1175	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1176	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Wendy, do come with me and tell the other boys.”
  1177	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1178	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tOf course she was very pleased to be asked, but she said, “Oh dear, I
  1179	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcan’t. Think of mummy! Besides, I can’t fly.”
  1180	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1181	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I’ll teach you.”
  1182	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1183	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Oh, how lovely to fly.”
  1184	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1185	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I’ll teach you how to jump on the wind’s back, and then away we go.”
  1186	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1187	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Oo!” she exclaimed rapturously.
  1188	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1189	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Wendy, Wendy, when you are sleeping in your silly bed you might be
  1190	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tflying about with me saying funny things to the stars.”
  1191	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1192	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Oo!”
  1193	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1194	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“And, Wendy, there are mermaids.”
  1195	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1196	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Mermaids! With tails?”
  1197	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1198	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Such long tails.”
  1199	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1200	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Oh,” cried Wendy, “to see a mermaid!”
  1201	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1202	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe had become frightfully cunning. “Wendy,” he said, “how we should all
  1203	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\trespect you.”
  1204	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1205	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tShe was wriggling her body in distress. It was quite as if she were
  1206	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttrying to remain on the nursery floor.
  1207	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1208	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tBut he had no pity for her.
  1209	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1210	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Wendy,” he said, the sly one, “you could tuck us in at night.”
  1211	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1212	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Oo!”
  1213	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1214	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“None of us has ever been tucked in at night.”
  1215	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1216	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Oo,” and her arms went out to him.
  1217	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1218	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“And you could darn our clothes, and make pockets for us. None of us has
  1219	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tany pockets.”
  1220	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1221	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHow could she resist. “Of course it’s awfully fascinating!” she cried.
  1222	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Peter, would you teach John and Michael to fly too?”
  1223	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1224	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“If you like,” he said indifferently, and she ran to John and Michael
  1225	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand shook them. “Wake up,” she cried, “Peter Pan has come and he is to
  1226	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tteach us to fly.”
  1227	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1228	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tJohn rubbed his eyes. “Then I shall get up,” he said. Of course he was
  1229	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ton the floor already. “Hallo,” he said, “I am up!”
  1230	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1231	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tMichael was up by this time also, looking as sharp as a knife with six
  1232	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tblades and a saw, but Peter suddenly signed silence. Their faces assumed
  1233	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe awful craftiness of children listening for sounds from the grown-up
  1234	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tworld. All was as still as salt. Then everything was right. No, stop!
  1235	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tEverything was wrong. Nana, who had been barking distressfully all the
  1236	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tevening, was quiet now. It was her silence they had heard.
  1237	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1238	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Out with the light! Hide! Quick!” cried John, taking command for the
  1239	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tonly time throughout the whole adventure. And thus when Liza entered,
  1240	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tholding Nana, the nursery seemed quite its old self, very dark, and
  1241	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tyou would have sworn you heard its three wicked inmates breathing
  1242	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tangelically as they slept. They were really doing it artfully from
  1243	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbehind the window curtains.
  1244	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1245	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tLiza was in a bad temper, for she was mixing the Christmas puddings in
  1246	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe kitchen, and had been drawn from them, with a raisin still on her
  1247	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcheek, by Nana’s absurd suspicions. She thought the best way of getting
  1248	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ta little quiet was to take Nana to the nursery for a moment, but in
  1249	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcustody of course.
  1250	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1251	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“There, you suspicious brute,” she said, not sorry that Nana was in
  1252	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdisgrace. “They are perfectly safe, aren’t they? Every one of the little
  1253	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tangels sound asleep in bed. Listen to their gentle breathing.”
  1254	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1255	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHere Michael, encouraged by his success, breathed so loudly that they
  1256	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twere nearly detected. Nana knew that kind of breathing, and she tried to
  1257	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdrag herself out of Liza’s clutches.
  1258	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1259	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tBut Liza was dense. “No more of it, Nana,” she said sternly, pulling
  1260	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ther out of the room. “I warn you if you bark again I shall go straight
  1261	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfor master and missus and bring them home from the party, and then, oh,
  1262	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twon’t master whip you, just.”
  1263	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1264	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tShe tied the unhappy dog up again, but do you think Nana ceased to bark?
  1265	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tBring master and missus home from the party! Why, that was just what she
  1266	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twanted. Do you think she cared whether she was whipped so long as her
  1267	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcharges were safe? Unfortunately Liza returned to her puddings, and
  1268	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNana, seeing that no help would come from her, strained and strained at
  1269	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe chain until at last she broke it. In another moment she had burst
  1270	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tinto the dining-room of 27 and flung up her paws to heaven, her most
  1271	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\texpressive way of making a communication. Mr. and Mrs. Darling knew at
  1272	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tonce that something terrible was happening in their nursery, and without
  1273	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ta good-bye to their hostess they rushed into the street.
  1274	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1275	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tBut it was now ten minutes since three scoundrels had been breathing
  1276	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbehind the curtains, and Peter Pan can do a great deal in ten minutes.
  1277	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1278	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWe now return to the nursery.
  1279	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1280	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“It’s all right,” John announced, emerging from his hiding-place. “I
  1281	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsay, Peter, can you really fly?”
  1282	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1283	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tInstead of troubling to answer him Peter flew around the room, taking
  1284	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe mantelpiece on the way.
  1285	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1286	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“How topping!” said John and Michael.
  1287	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1288	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“How sweet!” cried Wendy.
  1289	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1290	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Yes, I’m sweet, oh, I am sweet!” said Peter, forgetting his manners
  1291	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tagain.
  1292	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1293	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIt looked delightfully easy, and they tried it first from the floor and
  1294	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthen from the beds, but they always went down instead of up.
  1295	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1296	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I say, how do you do it?” asked John, rubbing his knee. He was quite a
  1297	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tpractical boy.
  1298	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1299	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“You just think lovely wonderful thoughts,” Peter explained, “and they
  1300	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlift you up in the air.”
  1301	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1302	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe showed them again.
  1303	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1304	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“You’re so nippy at it,” John said, “couldn’t you do it very slowly
  1305	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tonce?”
  1306	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1307	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPeter did it both slowly and quickly. “I’ve got it now, Wendy!” cried
  1308	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tJohn, but soon he found he had not. Not one of them could fly an inch,
  1309	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthough even Michael was in words of two syllables, and Peter did not
  1310	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tknow A from Z.
  1311	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1312	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tOf course Peter had been trifling with them, for no one can fly unless
  1313	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe fairy dust has been blown on him. Fortunately, as we have mentioned,
  1314	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tone of his hands was messy with it, and he blew some on each of them,
  1315	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twith the most superb results.
  1316	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1317	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Now just wiggle your shoulders this way,” he said, “and let go.”
  1318	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1319	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThey were all on their beds, and gallant Michael let go first. He did
  1320	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnot quite mean to let go, but he did it, and immediately he was borne
  1321	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tacross the room.
  1322	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1323	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I flewed!” he screamed while still in mid-air.
  1324	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1325	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tJohn let go and met Wendy near the bathroom.
  1326	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1327	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Oh, lovely!”
  1328	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1329	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Oh, ripping!”
  1330	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1331	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Look at me!”
  1332	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1333	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Look at me!”
  1334	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1335	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Look at me!”
  1336	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1337	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThey were not nearly so elegant as Peter, they could not help kicking a
  1338	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlittle, but their heads were bobbing against the ceiling, and there is
  1339	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\talmost nothing so delicious as that. Peter gave Wendy a hand at first,
  1340	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbut had to desist, Tink was so indignant.
  1341	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1342	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tUp and down they went, and round and round. Heavenly was Wendy’s word.
  1343	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1344	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I say,” cried John, “why shouldn’t we all go out?”
  1345	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1346	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tOf course it was to this that Peter had been luring them.
  1347	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1348	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tMichael was ready: he wanted to see how long it took him to do a billion
  1349	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmiles. But Wendy hesitated.
  1350	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1351	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Mermaids!” said Peter again.
  1352	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1353	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Oo!”
  1354	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1355	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“And there are pirates.”
  1356	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1357	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Pirates,” cried John, seizing his Sunday hat, “let us go at once.”
  1358	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1359	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIt was just at this moment that Mr. and Mrs. Darling hurried with Nana
  1360	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tout of 27. They ran into the middle of the street to look up at the
  1361	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnursery window; and, yes, it was still shut, but the room was ablaze
  1362	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twith light, and most heart-gripping sight of all, they could see in
  1363	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tshadow on the curtain three little figures in night attire circling
  1364	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tround and round, not on the floor but in the air.
  1365	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1366	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNot three figures, four!
  1367	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1368	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIn a tremble they opened the street door. Mr. Darling would have rushed
  1369	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tupstairs, but Mrs. Darling signed him to go softly. She even tried to
  1370	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmake her heart go softly.
  1371	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1372	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWill they reach the nursery in time? If so, how delightful for them, and
  1373	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twe shall all breathe a sigh of relief, but there will be no story. On
  1374	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe other hand, if they are not in time, I solemnly promise that it will
  1375	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tall come right in the end.
  1376	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1377	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThey would have reached the nursery in time had it not been that the
  1378	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlittle stars were watching them. Once again the stars blew the window
  1379	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\topen, and that smallest star of all called out:
  1380	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1381	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Cave, Peter!”
  1382	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1383	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThen Peter knew that there was not a moment to lose. “Come,” he cried
  1384	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\timperiously, and soared out at once into the night, followed by John and
  1385	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tMichael and Wendy.
  1386	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1387	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tMr. and Mrs. Darling and Nana rushed into the nursery too late. The
  1388	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbirds were flown.
  1389	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t

  1393	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tChapter 4 THE FLIGHT
  1394	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1395	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Second to the right, and straight on till morning.”
  1396	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1397	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThat, Peter had told Wendy, was the way to the Neverland; but even
  1398	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbirds, carrying maps and consulting them at windy corners, could not
  1399	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thave sighted it with these instructions. Peter, you see, just said
  1400	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tanything that came into his head.
  1401	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1402	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAt first his companions trusted him implicitly, and so great were the
  1403	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdelights of flying that they wasted time circling round church spires or
  1404	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tany other tall objects on the way that took their fancy.
  1405	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1406	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tJohn and Michael raced, Michael getting a start.
  1407	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1408	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThey recalled with contempt that not so long ago they had thought
  1409	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthemselves fine fellows for being able to fly round a room.
  1410	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1411	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNot long ago. But how long ago? They were flying over the sea before
  1412	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthis thought began to disturb Wendy seriously. John thought it was their
  1413	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsecond sea and their third night.
  1414	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1415	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tSometimes it was dark and sometimes light, and now they were very cold
  1416	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand again too warm. Did they really feel hungry at times, or were they
  1417	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmerely pretending, because Peter had such a jolly new way of feeding
  1418	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthem? His way was to pursue birds who had food in their mouths suitable
  1419	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfor humans and snatch it from them; then the birds would follow and
  1420	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsnatch it back; and they would all go chasing each other gaily for
  1421	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmiles, parting at last with mutual expressions of good-will. But Wendy
  1422	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnoticed with gentle concern that Peter did not seem to know that this
  1423	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twas rather an odd way of getting your bread and butter, nor even that
  1424	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthere are other ways.
  1425	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1426	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tCertainly they did not pretend to be sleepy, they were sleepy; and that
  1427	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twas a danger, for the moment they popped off, down they fell. The awful
  1428	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthing was that Peter thought this funny.
  1429	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1430	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“There he goes again!” he would cry gleefully, as Michael suddenly
  1431	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdropped like a stone.
  1432	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1433	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Save him, save him!” cried Wendy, looking with horror at the cruel
  1434	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsea far below. Eventually Peter would dive through the air, and catch
  1435	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tMichael just before he could strike the sea, and it was lovely the way
  1436	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\the did it; but he always waited till the last moment, and you felt it
  1437	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twas his cleverness that interested him and not the saving of human life.
  1438	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAlso he was fond of variety, and the sport that engrossed him one moment
  1439	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twould suddenly cease to engage him, so there was always the possibility
  1440	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthat the next time you fell he would let you go.
  1441	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1442	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe could sleep in the air without falling, by merely lying on his back
  1443	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand floating, but this was, partly at least, because he was so light
  1444	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthat if you got behind him and blew he went faster.
  1445	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1446	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Do be more polite to him,” Wendy whispered to John, when they were
  1447	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tplaying “Follow my Leader.”
  1448	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1449	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Then tell him to stop showing off,” said John.
  1450	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1451	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWhen playing Follow my Leader, Peter would fly close to the water and
  1452	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttouch each shark’s tail in passing, just as in the street you may run
  1453	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tyour finger along an iron railing. They could not follow him in this
  1454	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twith much success, so perhaps it was rather like showing off, especially
  1455	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tas he kept looking behind to see how many tails they missed.
  1456	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1457	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“You must be nice to him,” Wendy impressed on her brothers. “What could
  1458	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twe do if he were to leave us!”
  1459	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1460	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“We could go back,” Michael said.
  1461	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1462	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“How could we ever find our way back without him?”
  1463	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1464	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Well, then, we could go on,” said John.
  1465	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1466	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“That is the awful thing, John. We should have to go on, for we don’t
  1467	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tknow how to stop.”
  1468	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1469	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThis was true, Peter had forgotten to show them how to stop.
  1470	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1471	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tJohn said that if the worst came to the worst, all they had to do was to
  1472	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tgo straight on, for the world was round, and so in time they must come
  1473	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tback to their own window.
  1474	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1475	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“And who is to get food for us, John?”
  1476	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1477	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I nipped a bit out of that eagle’s mouth pretty neatly, Wendy.”
  1478	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1479	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“After the twentieth try,” Wendy reminded him. “And even though we
  1480	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbecame good at picking up food, see how we bump against clouds and things
  1481	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tif he is not near to give us a hand.”
  1482	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1483	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIndeed they were constantly bumping. They could now fly strongly, though
  1484	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthey still kicked far too much; but if they saw a cloud in front of
  1485	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthem, the more they tried to avoid it, the more certainly did they bump
  1486	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tinto it. If Nana had been with them, she would have had a bandage round
  1487	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tMichael’s forehead by this time.
  1488	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1489	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPeter was not with them for the moment, and they felt rather lonely up
  1490	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthere by themselves. He could go so much faster than they that he would
  1491	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsuddenly shoot out of sight, to have some adventure in which they had no
  1492	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tshare. He would come down laughing over something fearfully funny he had
  1493	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbeen saying to a star, but he had already forgotten what it was, or he
  1494	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twould come up with mermaid scales still sticking to him, and yet not be
  1495	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\table to say for certain what had been happening. It was really rather
  1496	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tirritating to children who had never seen a mermaid.
  1497	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1498	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“And if he forgets them so quickly,” Wendy argued, “how can we expect
  1499	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthat he will go on remembering us?”
  1500	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1501	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIndeed, sometimes when he returned he did not remember them, at least
  1502	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnot well. Wendy was sure of it. She saw recognition come into his eyes
  1503	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tas he was about to pass them the time of day and go on; once even she
  1504	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thad to call him by name.
  1505	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1506	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I’m Wendy,” she said agitatedly.
  1507	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1508	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe was very sorry. “I say, Wendy,” he whispered to her, “always if you
  1509	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsee me forgetting you, just keep on saying ‘I’m Wendy,’ and then I’ll
  1510	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tremember.”
  1511	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1512	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tOf course this was rather unsatisfactory. However, to make amends he
  1513	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tshowed them how to lie out flat on a strong wind that was going their
  1514	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tway, and this was such a pleasant change that they tried it several
  1515	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttimes and found that they could sleep thus with security. Indeed they
  1516	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twould have slept longer, but Peter tired quickly of sleeping, and soon
  1517	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\the would cry in his captain voice, “We get off here.” So with occasional
  1518	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttiffs, but on the whole rollicking, they drew near the Neverland; for
  1519	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tafter many moons they did reach it, and, what is more, they had been
  1520	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tgoing pretty straight all the time, not perhaps so much owing to the
  1521	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tguidance of Peter or Tink as because the island was looking for them. It
  1522	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tis only thus that any one may sight those magic shores.
  1523	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1524	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“There it is,” said Peter calmly.
  1525	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1526	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Where, where?”
  1527	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1528	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Where all the arrows are pointing.”
  1529	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1530	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIndeed a million golden arrows were pointing it out to the children, all
  1531	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdirected by their friend the sun, who wanted them to be sure of their
  1532	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tway before leaving them for the night.
  1533	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1534	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWendy and John and Michael stood on tip-toe in the air to get their
  1535	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfirst sight of the island. Strange to say, they all recognized it at
  1536	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tonce, and until fear fell upon them they hailed it, not as something
  1537	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlong dreamt of and seen at last, but as a familiar friend to whom they
  1538	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twere returning home for the holidays.
  1539	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1540	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“John, there’s the lagoon.”
  1541	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1542	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Wendy, look at the turtles burying their eggs in the sand.”
  1543	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1544	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I say, John, I see your flamingo with the broken leg!”
  1545	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1546	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Look, Michael, there’s your cave!”
  1547	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1548	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“John, what’s that in the brushwood?”
  1549	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1550	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“It’s a wolf with her whelps. Wendy, I do believe that’s your little
  1551	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twhelp!”
  1552	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1553	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“There’s my boat, John, with her sides stove in!”
  1554	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1555	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“No, it isn’t. Why, we burned your boat.”
  1556	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1557	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“That’s her, at any rate. I say, John, I see the smoke of the redskin
  1558	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcamp!”
  1559	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1560	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Where? Show me, and I’ll tell you by the way smoke curls whether they
  1561	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tare on the war-path.”
  1562	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1563	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“There, just across the Mysterious River.”
  1564	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1565	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I see now. Yes, they are on the war-path right enough.”
  1566	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1567	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPeter was a little annoyed with them for knowing so much, but if he
  1568	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twanted to lord it over them his triumph was at hand, for have I not told
  1569	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tyou that anon fear fell upon them?
  1570	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1571	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIt came as the arrows went, leaving the island in gloom.
  1572	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1573	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIn the old days at home the Neverland had always begun to look a little
  1574	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdark and threatening by bedtime. Then unexplored patches arose in it
  1575	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand spread, black shadows moved about in them, the roar of the beasts of
  1576	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tprey was quite different now, and above all, you lost the certainty that
  1577	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tyou would win. You were quite glad that the night-lights were on. You
  1578	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\teven liked Nana to say that this was just the mantelpiece over here, and
  1579	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthat the Neverland was all make-believe.
  1580	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1581	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tOf course the Neverland had been make-believe in those days, but it
  1582	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twas real now, and there were no night-lights, and it was getting darker
  1583	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tevery moment, and where was Nana?
  1584	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1585	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThey had been flying apart, but they huddled close to Peter now. His
  1586	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcareless manner had gone at last, his eyes were sparkling, and a tingle
  1587	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twent through them every time they touched his body. They were now over
  1588	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe fearsome island, flying so low that sometimes a tree grazed their
  1589	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfeet. Nothing horrid was visible in the air, yet their progress had
  1590	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbecome slow and laboured, exactly as if they were pushing their way
  1591	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthrough hostile forces. Sometimes they hung in the air until Peter had
  1592	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbeaten on it with his fists.
  1593	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1594	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“They don’t want us to land,” he explained.
  1595	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1596	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Who are they?” Wendy whispered, shuddering.
  1597	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1598	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tBut he could not or would not say. Tinker Bell had been asleep on his
  1599	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tshoulder, but now he wakened her and sent her on in front.
  1600	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1601	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tSometimes he poised himself in the air, listening intently, with his
  1602	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thand to his ear, and again he would stare down with eyes so bright that
  1603	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthey seemed to bore two holes to earth. Having done these things, he
  1604	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twent on again.
  1605	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1606	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHis courage was almost appalling. “Would you like an adventure now,” he
  1607	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsaid casually to John, “or would you like to have your tea first?”
  1608	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1609	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWendy said “tea first” quickly, and Michael pressed her hand in
  1610	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tgratitude, but the braver John hesitated.
  1611	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1612	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“What kind of adventure?” he asked cautiously.
  1613	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1614	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“There’s a pirate asleep in the pampas just beneath us,” Peter told him.
  1615	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“If you like, we’ll go down and kill him.”
  1616	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1617	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I don’t see him,” John said after a long pause.
  1618	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1619	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I do.”
  1620	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1621	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Suppose,” John said, a little huskily, “he were to wake up.”
  1622	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1623	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPeter spoke indignantly. “You don’t think I would kill him while he was
  1624	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsleeping! I would wake him first, and then kill him. That’s the way I
  1625	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\talways do.”
  1626	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1627	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I say! Do you kill many?”
  1628	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1629	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Tons.”
  1630	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1631	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tJohn said “How ripping,” but decided to have tea first. He asked if
  1632	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthere were many pirates on the island just now, and Peter said he had
  1633	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnever known so many.
  1634	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1635	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Who is captain now?”
  1636	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1637	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Hook,” answered Peter, and his face became very stern as he said that
  1638	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thated word.
  1639	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1640	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Jas. Hook?”
  1641	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1642	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Ay.”
  1643	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1644	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThen indeed Michael began to cry, and even John could speak in gulps
  1645	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tonly, for they knew Hook’s reputation.
  1646	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1647	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“He was Blackbeard’s bo’sun,” John whispered huskily. “He is the worst
  1648	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tof them all. He is the only man of whom Barbecue was afraid.”
  1649	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1650	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“That’s him,” said Peter.
  1651	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1652	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“What is he like? Is he big?”
  1653	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1654	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“He is not so big as he was.”
  1655	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1656	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“How do you mean?”
  1657	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1658	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I cut off a bit of him.”
  1659	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1660	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“You!”
  1661	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1662	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Yes, me,” said Peter sharply.
  1663	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1664	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I wasn’t meaning to be disrespectful.”
  1665	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1666	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Oh, all right.”
  1667	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1668	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“But, I say, what bit?”
  1669	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1670	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“His right hand.”
  1671	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1672	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Then he can’t fight now?”
  1673	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1674	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Oh, can’t he just!”
  1675	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1676	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Left-hander?”
  1677	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1678	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“He has an iron hook instead of a right hand, and he claws with it.”
  1679	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1680	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Claws!”
  1681	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1682	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I say, John,” said Peter.
  1683	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1684	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Yes.”
  1685	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1686	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Say, ‘Ay, ay, sir.’”
  1687	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1688	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Ay, ay, sir.”
  1689	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1690	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“There is one thing,” Peter continued, “that every boy who serves under
  1691	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tme has to promise, and so must you.”
  1692	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1693	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tJohn paled.
  1694	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1695	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“It is this, if we meet Hook in open fight, you must leave him to me.”
  1696	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1697	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I promise,” John said loyally.
  1698	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1699	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tFor the moment they were feeling less eerie, because Tink was flying
  1700	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twith them, and in her light they could distinguish each other.
  1701	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tUnfortunately she could not fly so slowly as they, and so she had to go
  1702	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tround and round them in a circle in which they moved as in a halo. Wendy
  1703	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tquite liked it, until Peter pointed out the drawbacks.
  1704	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1705	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“She tells me,” he said, “that the pirates sighted us before the
  1706	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdarkness came, and got Long Tom out.”
  1707	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1708	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“The big gun?”
  1709	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1710	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Yes. And of course they must see her light, and if they guess we are
  1711	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnear it they are sure to let fly.”
  1712	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1713	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Wendy!”
  1714	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1715	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“John!”
  1716	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1717	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Michael!”
  1718	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1719	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Tell her to go away at once, Peter,” the three cried simultaneously,
  1720	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbut he refused.
  1721	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1722	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“She thinks we have lost the way,” he replied stiffly, “and she is
  1723	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\trather frightened. You don’t think I would send her away all by herself
  1724	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twhen she is frightened!”
  1725	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1726	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tFor a moment the circle of light was broken, and something gave Peter a
  1727	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tloving little pinch.
  1728	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1729	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Then tell her,” Wendy begged, “to put out her light.”
  1730	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1731	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“She can’t put it out. That is about the only thing fairies can’t do. It
  1732	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tjust goes out of itself when she falls asleep, same as the stars.”
  1733	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1734	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Then tell her to sleep at once,” John almost ordered.
  1735	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1736	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“She can’t sleep except when she’s sleepy. It is the only other thing
  1737	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfairies can’t do.”
  1738	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1739	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Seems to me,” growled John, “these are the only two things worth
  1740	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdoing.”
  1741	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1742	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHere he got a pinch, but not a loving one.
  1743	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1744	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“If only one of us had a pocket,” Peter said, “we could carry her in
  1745	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tit.” However, they had set off in such a hurry that there was not a
  1746	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tpocket between the four of them.
  1747	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1748	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe had a happy idea. John’s hat!
  1749	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1750	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tTink agreed to travel by hat if it was carried in the hand. John carried
  1751	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tit, though she had hoped to be carried by Peter. Presently Wendy took
  1752	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe hat, because John said it struck against his knee as he flew; and
  1753	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthis, as we shall see, led to mischief, for Tinker Bell hated to be
  1754	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tunder an obligation to Wendy.
  1755	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1756	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIn the black topper the light was completely hidden, and they flew on in
  1757	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsilence. It was the stillest silence they had ever known, broken once by
  1758	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ta distant lapping, which Peter explained was the wild beasts drinking at
  1759	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe ford, and again by a rasping sound that might have been the branches
  1760	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tof trees rubbing together, but he said it was the redskins sharpening
  1761	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttheir knives.
  1762	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1763	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tEven these noises ceased. To Michael the loneliness was dreadful. “If
  1764	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tonly something would make a sound!” he cried.
  1765	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1766	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAs if in answer to his request, the air was rent by the most tremendous
  1767	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcrash he had ever heard. The pirates had fired Long Tom at them.
  1768	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1769	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe roar of it echoed through the mountains, and the echoes seemed to
  1770	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcry savagely, “Where are they, where are they, where are they?”
  1771	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1772	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThus sharply did the terrified three learn the difference between an
  1773	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tisland of make-believe and the same island come true.
  1774	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1775	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWhen at last the heavens were steady again, John and Michael
  1776	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfound themselves alone in the darkness. John was treading the air
  1777	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmechanically, and Michael without knowing how to float was floating.
  1778	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1779	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Are you shot?” John whispered tremulously.
  1780	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1781	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I haven’t tried [myself out] yet,” Michael whispered back.
  1782	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1783	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWe know now that no one had been hit. Peter, however, had been carried
  1784	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tby the wind of the shot far out to sea, while Wendy was blown upwards
  1785	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twith no companion but Tinker Bell.
  1786	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1787	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIt would have been well for Wendy if at that moment she had dropped the
  1788	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\that.
  1789	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1790	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tI don’t know whether the idea came suddenly to Tink, or whether she had
  1791	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tplanned it on the way, but she at once popped out of the hat and began
  1792	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tto lure Wendy to her destruction.
  1793	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1794	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tTink was not all bad; or, rather, she was all bad just now, but, on the
  1795	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tother hand, sometimes she was all good. Fairies have to be one thing or
  1796	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe other, because being so small they unfortunately have room for one
  1797	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfeeling only at a time. They are, however, allowed to change, only it
  1798	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmust be a complete change. At present she was full of jealousy of Wendy.
  1799	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWhat she said in her lovely tinkle Wendy could not of course understand,
  1800	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand I believe some of it was bad words, but it sounded kind, and she
  1801	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tflew back and forward, plainly meaning “Follow me, and all will be
  1802	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twell.”
  1803	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1804	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWhat else could poor Wendy do? She called to Peter and John and Michael,
  1805	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand got only mocking echoes in reply. She did not yet know that Tink
  1806	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thated her with the fierce hatred of a very woman. And so, bewildered,
  1807	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand now staggering in her flight, she followed Tink to her doom.
  1808	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1809	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t

  1811	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1812	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tChapter 5 THE ISLAND COME TRUE
  1813	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1814	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tFeeling that Peter was on his way back, the Neverland had again woke
  1815	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tinto life. We ought to use the pluperfect and say wakened, but woke is
  1816	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbetter and was always used by Peter.
  1817	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1818	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIn his absence things are usually quiet on the island. The fairies take
  1819	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tan hour longer in the morning, the beasts attend to their young, the
  1820	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tredskins feed heavily for six days and nights, and when pirates and
  1821	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlost boys meet they merely bite their thumbs at each other. But with the
  1822	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcoming of Peter, who hates lethargy, they are under way again: if you
  1823	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tput your ear to the ground now, you would hear the whole island seething
  1824	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twith life.
  1825	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1826	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tOn this evening the chief forces of the island were disposed as follows.
  1827	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe lost boys were out looking for Peter, the pirates were out looking
  1828	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfor the lost boys, the redskins were out looking for the pirates, and
  1829	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe beasts were out looking for the redskins. They were going round and
  1830	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tround the island, but they did not meet because all were going at the
  1831	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsame rate.
  1832	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1833	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAll wanted blood except the boys, who liked it as a rule, but to-night
  1834	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twere out to greet their captain. The boys on the island vary, of course,
  1835	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tin numbers, according as they get killed and so on; and when they seem
  1836	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tto be growing up, which is against the rules, Peter thins them out; but
  1837	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tat this time there were six of them, counting the twins as two. Let us
  1838	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tpretend to lie here among the sugar-cane and watch them as they steal by
  1839	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tin single file, each with his hand on his dagger.
  1840	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1841	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThey are forbidden by Peter to look in the least like him, and they wear
  1842	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe skins of the bears slain by themselves, in which they are so round
  1843	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand furry that when they fall they roll. They have therefore become very
  1844	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsure-footed.
  1845	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1846	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe first to pass is Tootles, not the least brave but the most
  1847	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tunfortunate of all that gallant band. He had been in fewer adventures
  1848	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthan any of them, because the big things constantly happened just when
  1849	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\the had stepped round the corner; all would be quiet, he would take the
  1850	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\topportunity of going off to gather a few sticks for firewood, and
  1851	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthen when he returned the others would be sweeping up the blood. This
  1852	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\till-luck had given a gentle melancholy to his countenance, but instead
  1853	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tof souring his nature had sweetened it, so that he was quite the
  1854	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thumblest of the boys. Poor kind Tootles, there is danger in the air for
  1855	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tyou to-night. Take care lest an adventure is now offered you, which, if
  1856	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\taccepted, will plunge you in deepest woe. Tootles, the fairy Tink, who
  1857	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tis bent on mischief this night is looking for a tool [for doing her
  1858	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmischief], and she thinks you are the most easily tricked of the boys.
  1859	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t‘Ware Tinker Bell.
  1860	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1861	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWould that he could hear us, but we are not really on the island, and he
  1862	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tpasses by, biting his knuckles.
  1863	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1864	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNext comes Nibs, the gay and debonair, followed by Slightly, who cuts
  1865	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twhistles out of the trees and dances ecstatically to his own tunes.
  1866	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tSlightly is the most conceited of the boys. He thinks he remembers the
  1867	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdays before he was lost, with their manners and customs, and this has
  1868	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tgiven his nose an offensive tilt. Curly is fourth; he is a pickle, [a
  1869	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tperson who gets in pickles-predicaments] and so often has he had to
  1870	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdeliver up his person when Peter said sternly, “Stand forth the one who
  1871	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdid this thing,” that now at the command he stands forth automatically
  1872	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twhether he has done it or not. Last come the Twins, who cannot be
  1873	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdescribed because we should be sure to be describing the wrong one.
  1874	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPeter never quite knew what twins were, and his band were not allowed
  1875	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tto know anything he did not know, so these two were always vague about
  1876	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthemselves, and did their best to give satisfaction by keeping close
  1877	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttogether in an apologetic sort of way.
  1878	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1879	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe boys vanish in the gloom, and after a pause, but not a long pause,
  1880	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfor things go briskly on the island, come the pirates on their track. We
  1881	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thear them before they are seen, and it is always the same dreadful song:
  1882	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1883	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t     “Avast belay, yo ho, heave to,
  1884	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t     A-pirating we go,
  1885	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t     And if we’re parted by a shot
  1886	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t     We’re sure to meet below!”
  1887	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1888	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tA more villainous-looking lot never hung in a row on Execution dock.
  1889	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHere, a little in advance, ever and again with his head to the
  1890	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tground listening, his great arms bare, pieces of eight in his ears as
  1891	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tornaments, is the handsome Italian Cecco, who cut his name in letters
  1892	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tof blood on the back of the governor of the prison at Gao. That gigantic
  1893	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tblack behind him has had many names since he dropped the one with
  1894	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twhich dusky mothers still terrify their children on the banks of the
  1895	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tGuadjo-mo. Here is Bill Jukes, every inch of him tattooed, the same Bill
  1896	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tJukes who got six dozen on the WALRUS from Flint before he would drop
  1897	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe bag of moidores [Portuguese gold pieces]; and Cookson, said to
  1898	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbe Black Murphy’s brother (but this was never proved), and Gentleman
  1899	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tStarkey, once an usher in a public school and still dainty in his ways
  1900	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tof killing; and Skylights (Morgan’s Skylights); and the Irish bo’sun
  1901	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tSmee, an oddly genial man who stabbed, so to speak, without offence,
  1902	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand was the only Non-conformist in Hook’s crew; and Noodler, whose
  1903	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thands were fixed on backwards; and Robt. Mullins and Alf Mason and many
  1904	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tanother ruffian long known and feared on the Spanish Main.
  1905	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1906	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIn the midst of them, the blackest and largest in that dark setting,
  1907	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\treclined James Hook, or as he wrote himself, Jas. Hook, of whom it is
  1908	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsaid he was the only man that the Sea-Cook feared. He lay at his ease in
  1909	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ta rough chariot drawn and propelled by his men, and instead of a right
  1910	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thand he had the iron hook with which ever and anon he encouraged them
  1911	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tto increase their pace. As dogs this terrible man treated and addressed
  1912	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthem, and as dogs they obeyed him. In person he was cadaverous [dead
  1913	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlooking] and blackavized [dark faced], and his hair was dressed in long
  1914	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcurls, which at a little distance looked like black candles, and gave a
  1915	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsingularly threatening expression to his handsome countenance. His eyes
  1916	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twere of the blue of the forget-me-not, and of a profound melancholy,
  1917	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsave when he was plunging his hook into you, at which time two red spots
  1918	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tappeared in them and lit them up horribly. In manner, something of the
  1919	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tgrand seigneur still clung to him, so that he even ripped you up with
  1920	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tan air, and I have been told that he was a RACONTEUR [storyteller] of
  1921	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\trepute. He was never more sinister than when he was most polite,
  1922	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twhich is probably the truest test of breeding; and the elegance of his
  1923	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdiction, even when he was swearing, no less than the distinction of his
  1924	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdemeanour, showed him one of a different cast from his crew. A man of
  1925	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tindomitable courage, it was said that the only thing he shied at was
  1926	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe sight of his own blood, which was thick and of an unusual colour.
  1927	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIn dress he somewhat aped the attire associated with the name of Charles
  1928	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tII, having heard it said in some earlier period of his career that he
  1929	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbore a strange resemblance to the ill-fated Stuarts; and in his mouth
  1930	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\the had a holder of his own contrivance which enabled him to smoke two
  1931	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcigars at once. But undoubtedly the grimmest part of him was his iron
  1932	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tclaw.
  1933	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1934	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tLet us now kill a pirate, to show Hook’s method. Skylights will do. As
  1935	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthey pass, Skylights lurches clumsily against him, ruffling his lace
  1936	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcollar; the hook shoots forth, there is a tearing sound and one screech,
  1937	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthen the body is kicked aside, and the pirates pass on. He has not even
  1938	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttaken the cigars from his mouth.
  1939	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1940	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tSuch is the terrible man against whom Peter Pan is pitted. Which will
  1941	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twin?
  1942	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1943	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tOn the trail of the pirates, stealing noiselessly down the war-path,
  1944	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twhich is not visible to inexperienced eyes, come the redskins, every one
  1945	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tof them with his eyes peeled. They carry tomahawks and knives, and their
  1946	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnaked bodies gleam with paint and oil. Strung around them are scalps, of
  1947	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tboys as well as of pirates, for these are the Piccaninny tribe, and not
  1948	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tto be confused with the softer-hearted Delawares or the Hurons. In
  1949	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe van, on all fours, is Great Big Little Panther, a brave of so many
  1950	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tscalps that in his present position they somewhat impede his progress.
  1951	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tBringing up the rear, the place of greatest danger, comes Tiger Lily,
  1952	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tproudly erect, a princess in her own right. She is the most beautiful
  1953	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tof dusky Dianas [Diana = goddess of the woods] and the belle of the
  1954	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPiccaninnies, coquettish [flirting], cold and amorous [loving] by turns;
  1955	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthere is not a brave who would not have the wayward thing to wife, but
  1956	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tshe staves off the altar with a hatchet. Observe how they pass over
  1957	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfallen twigs without making the slightest noise. The only sound to be
  1958	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\theard is their somewhat heavy breathing. The fact is that they are all a
  1959	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlittle fat just now after the heavy gorging, but in time they will work
  1960	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthis off. For the moment, however, it constitutes their chief danger.
  1961	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1962	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe redskins disappear as they have come like shadows, and soon their
  1963	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tplace is taken by the beasts, a great and motley procession: lions,
  1964	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttigers, bears, and the innumerable smaller savage things that flee
  1965	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfrom them, for every kind of beast, and, more particularly, all the
  1966	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tman-eaters, live cheek by jowl on the favoured island. Their tongues are
  1967	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thanging out, they are hungry to-night.
  1968	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1969	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWhen they have passed, comes the last figure of all, a gigantic
  1970	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcrocodile. We shall see for whom she is looking presently.
  1971	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1972	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe crocodile passes, but soon the boys appear again, for the procession
  1973	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmust continue indefinitely until one of the parties stops or changes its
  1974	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tpace. Then quickly they will be on top of each other.
  1975	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1976	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAll are keeping a sharp look-out in front, but none suspects that the
  1977	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdanger may be creeping up from behind. This shows how real the island
  1978	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twas.
  1979	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1980	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe first to fall out of the moving circle was the boys. They flung
  1981	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthemselves down on the sward [turf], close to their underground home.
  1982	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1983	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I do wish Peter would come back,” every one of them said nervously,
  1984	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthough in height and still more in breadth they were all larger than
  1985	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttheir captain.
  1986	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1987	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I am the only one who is not afraid of the pirates,” Slightly said, in
  1988	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe tone that prevented his being a general favourite; but perhaps some
  1989	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdistant sound disturbed him, for he added hastily, “but I wish he
  1990	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twould come back, and tell us whether he has heard anything more about
  1991	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tCinderella.”
  1992	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1993	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThey talked of Cinderella, and Tootles was confident that his mother
  1994	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmust have been very like her.
  1995	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1996	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIt was only in Peter’s absence that they could speak of mothers, the
  1997	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsubject being forbidden by him as silly.
  1998	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  1999	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“All I remember about my mother,” Nibs told them, “is that she often
  2000	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsaid to my father, ‘Oh, how I wish I had a cheque-book of my own!’ I
  2001	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdon’t know what a cheque-book is, but I should just love to give my
  2002	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmother one.”
  2003	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2004	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWhile they talked they heard a distant sound. You or I, not being wild
  2005	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthings of the woods, would have heard nothing, but they heard it, and it
  2006	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twas the grim song:
  2007	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2008	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t     “Yo ho, yo ho, the pirate life,
  2009	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t     The flag o’ skull and bones,
  2010	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t     A merry hour, a hempen rope,
  2011	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t     And hey for Davy Jones.”
  2012	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2013	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAt once the lost boys--but where are they? They are no longer there.
  2014	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tRabbits could not have disappeared more quickly.
  2015	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2016	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tI will tell you where they are. With the exception of Nibs, who has
  2017	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdarted away to reconnoitre [look around], they are already in their home
  2018	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tunder the ground, a very delightful residence of which we shall see
  2019	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ta good deal presently. But how have they reached it? for there is no
  2020	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tentrance to be seen, not so much as a large stone, which if rolled away,
  2021	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twould disclose the mouth of a cave. Look closely, however, and you may
  2022	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnote that there are here seven large trees, each with a hole in its
  2023	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thollow trunk as large as a boy. These are the seven entrances to the
  2024	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thome under the ground, for which Hook has been searching in vain these
  2025	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmany moons. Will he find it tonight?
  2026	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2027	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAs the pirates advanced, the quick eye of Starkey sighted Nibs
  2028	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdisappearing through the wood, and at once his pistol flashed out. But
  2029	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tan iron claw gripped his shoulder.
  2030	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2031	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Captain, let go!” he cried, writhing.
  2032	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2033	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNow for the first time we hear the voice of Hook. It was a black voice.
  2034	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Put back that pistol first,” it said threateningly.
  2035	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2036	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“It was one of those boys you hate. I could have shot him dead.”
  2037	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2038	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Ay, and the sound would have brought Tiger Lily’s redskins upon us. Do
  2039	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tyou want to lose your scalp?”
  2040	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2041	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Shall I after him, Captain,” asked pathetic Smee, “and tickle him
  2042	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twith Johnny Corkscrew?” Smee had pleasant names for everything, and his
  2043	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcutlass was Johnny Corkscrew, because he wiggled it in the wound. One
  2044	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcould mention many lovable traits in Smee. For instance, after killing,
  2045	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tit was his spectacles he wiped instead of his weapon.
  2046	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2047	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Johnny’s a silent fellow,” he reminded Hook.
  2048	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2049	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Not now, Smee,” Hook said darkly. “He is only one, and I want to
  2050	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmischief all the seven. Scatter and look for them.”
  2051	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2052	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe pirates disappeared among the trees, and in a moment their Captain
  2053	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand Smee were alone. Hook heaved a heavy sigh, and I know not why it
  2054	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twas, perhaps it was because of the soft beauty of the evening, but there
  2055	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcame over him a desire to confide to his faithful bo’sun the story of
  2056	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\this life. He spoke long and earnestly, but what it was all about Smee,
  2057	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twho was rather stupid, did not know in the least.
  2058	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2059	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAnon [later] he caught the word Peter.
  2060	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2061	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Most of all,” Hook was saying passionately, “I want their captain,
  2062	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPeter Pan. ‘Twas he cut off my arm.” He brandished the hook
  2063	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthreateningly. “I’ve waited long to shake his hand with this. Oh, I’ll
  2064	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttear him!”
  2065	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2066	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“And yet,” said Smee, “I have often heard you say that hook was worth a
  2067	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tscore of hands, for combing the hair and other homely uses.”
  2068	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2069	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Ay,” the captain answered, “if I was a mother I would pray to have my
  2070	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tchildren born with this instead of that,” and he cast a look of pride
  2071	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tupon his iron hand and one of scorn upon the other. Then again he
  2072	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfrowned.
  2073	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2074	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Peter flung my arm,” he said, wincing, “to a crocodile that happened to
  2075	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbe passing by.”
  2076	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2077	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I have often,” said Smee, “noticed your strange dread of crocodiles.”
  2078	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2079	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Not of crocodiles,” Hook corrected him, “but of that one crocodile.” He
  2080	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlowered his voice. “It liked my arm so much, Smee, that it has followed
  2081	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tme ever since, from sea to sea and from land to land, licking its lips
  2082	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfor the rest of me.”
  2083	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2084	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“In a way,” said Smee, “it’s sort of a compliment.”
  2085	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2086	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I want no such compliments,” Hook barked petulantly. “I want Peter Pan,
  2087	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twho first gave the brute its taste for me.”
  2088	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2089	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe sat down on a large mushroom, and now there was a quiver in his
  2090	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tvoice. “Smee,” he said huskily, “that crocodile would have had me before
  2091	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthis, but by a lucky chance it swallowed a clock which goes tick tick
  2092	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tinside it, and so before it can reach me I hear the tick and bolt.” He
  2093	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlaughed, but in a hollow way.
  2094	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2095	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Some day,” said Smee, “the clock will run down, and then he’ll get
  2096	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tyou.”
  2097	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2098	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHook wetted his dry lips. “Ay,” he said, “that’s the fear that haunts
  2099	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tme.”
  2100	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2101	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tSince sitting down he had felt curiously warm. “Smee,” he said, “this
  2102	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tseat is hot.” He jumped up. “Odds bobs, hammer and tongs I’m burning.”
  2103	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2104	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThey examined the mushroom, which was of a size and solidity unknown
  2105	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ton the mainland; they tried to pull it up, and it came away at once in
  2106	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttheir hands, for it had no root. Stranger still, smoke began at once
  2107	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tto ascend. The pirates looked at each other. “A chimney!” they both
  2108	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\texclaimed.
  2109	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2110	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThey had indeed discovered the chimney of the home under the ground. It
  2111	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twas the custom of the boys to stop it with a mushroom when enemies were
  2112	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tin the neighbourhood.
  2113	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2114	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNot only smoke came out of it. There came also children’s voices, for
  2115	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tso safe did the boys feel in their hiding-place that they were gaily
  2116	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tchattering. The pirates listened grimly, and then replaced the mushroom.
  2117	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThey looked around them and noted the holes in the seven trees.
  2118	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2119	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Did you hear them say Peter Pan’s from home?” Smee whispered, fidgeting
  2120	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twith Johnny Corkscrew.
  2121	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2122	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHook nodded. He stood for a long time lost in thought, and at last a
  2123	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcurdling smile lit up his swarthy face. Smee had been waiting for it.
  2124	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Unrip your plan, captain,” he cried eagerly.
  2125	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2126	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“To return to the ship,” Hook replied slowly through his teeth, “and
  2127	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcook a large rich cake of a jolly thickness with green sugar on it.
  2128	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThere can be but one room below, for there is but one chimney. The silly
  2129	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmoles had not the sense to see that they did not need a door apiece.
  2130	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThat shows they have no mother. We will leave the cake on the shore
  2131	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tof the Mermaids’ Lagoon. These boys are always swimming about there,
  2132	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tplaying with the mermaids. They will find the cake and they will gobble
  2133	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tit up, because, having no mother, they don’t know how dangerous ‘tis to
  2134	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\teat rich damp cake.” He burst into laughter, not hollow laughter now,
  2135	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbut honest laughter. “Aha, they will die.”
  2136	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2137	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tSmee had listened with growing admiration.
  2138	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2139	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“It’s the wickedest, prettiest policy ever I heard of!” he cried, and in
  2140	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttheir exultation they danced and sang:
  2141	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2142	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t     “Avast, belay, when I appear,
  2143	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t     By fear they’re overtook;
  2144	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t     Nought’s left upon your bones when you
  2145	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t     Have shaken claws with Hook.”
  2146	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2147	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThey began the verse, but they never finished it, for another sound
  2148	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbroke in and stilled them. There was at first such a tiny sound that a
  2149	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tleaf might have fallen on it and smothered it, but as it came nearer it
  2150	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twas more distinct.
  2151	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2152	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tTick tick tick tick!
  2153	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2154	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHook stood shuddering, one foot in the air.
  2155	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2156	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“The crocodile!” he gasped, and bounded away, followed by his bo’sun.
  2157	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2158	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIt was indeed the crocodile. It had passed the redskins, who were now on
  2159	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe trail of the other pirates. It oozed on after Hook.
  2160	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2161	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tOnce more the boys emerged into the open; but the dangers of the night
  2162	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twere not yet over, for presently Nibs rushed breathless into their
  2163	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmidst, pursued by a pack of wolves. The tongues of the pursuers were
  2164	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thanging out; the baying of them was horrible.
  2165	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2166	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Save me, save me!” cried Nibs, falling on the ground.
  2167	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2168	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“But what can we do, what can we do?”
  2169	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2170	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIt was a high compliment to Peter that at that dire moment their
  2171	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthoughts turned to him.
  2172	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2173	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“What would Peter do?” they cried simultaneously.
  2174	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2175	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAlmost in the same breath they cried, “Peter would look at them through
  2176	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\this legs.”
  2177	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2178	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAnd then, “Let us do what Peter would do.”
  2179	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2180	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIt is quite the most successful way of defying wolves, and as one boy
  2181	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthey bent and looked through their legs. The next moment is the long
  2182	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tone, but victory came quickly, for as the boys advanced upon them in the
  2183	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tterrible attitude, the wolves dropped their tails and fled.
  2184	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2185	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNow Nibs rose from the ground, and the others thought that his staring
  2186	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\teyes still saw the wolves. But it was not wolves he saw.
  2187	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2188	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I have seen a wonderfuller thing,” he cried, as they gathered round him
  2189	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\teagerly. “A great white bird. It is flying this way.”
  2190	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2191	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“What kind of a bird, do you think?”
  2192	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2193	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I don’t know,” Nibs said, awestruck, “but it looks so weary, and as it
  2194	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tflies it moans, ‘Poor Wendy.’”
  2195	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2196	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Poor Wendy?”
  2197	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2198	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I remember,” said Slightly instantly, “there are birds called Wendies.”
  2199	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2200	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“See, it comes!” cried Curly, pointing to Wendy in the heavens.
  2201	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2202	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWendy was now almost overhead, and they could hear her plaintive cry.
  2203	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tBut more distinct came the shrill voice of Tinker Bell. The jealous
  2204	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfairy had now cast off all disguise of friendship, and was darting
  2205	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tat her victim from every direction, pinching savagely each time she
  2206	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttouched.
  2207	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2208	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Hullo, Tink,” cried the wondering boys.
  2209	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2210	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tTink’s reply rang out: “Peter wants you to shoot the Wendy.”
  2211	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2212	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIt was not in their nature to question when Peter ordered. “Let us do
  2213	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twhat Peter wishes!” cried the simple boys. “Quick, bows and arrows!”
  2214	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2215	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAll but Tootles popped down their trees. He had a bow and arrow with
  2216	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thim, and Tink noted it, and rubbed her little hands.
  2217	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2218	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Quick, Tootles, quick,” she screamed. “Peter will be so pleased.”
  2219	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2220	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tTootles excitedly fitted the arrow to his bow. “Out of the way, Tink,”
  2221	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t he shouted, and then he fired, and Wendy fluttered to the ground with an
  2222	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tarrow in her breast.
  2223	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t

  2227	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tChapter 6 THE LITTLE HOUSE
  2228	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2229	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tFoolish Tootles was standing like a conqueror over Wendy’s body when the
  2230	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tother boys sprang, armed, from their trees.
  2231	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2232	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“You are too late,” he cried proudly, “I have shot the Wendy. Peter will
  2233	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbe so pleased with me.”
  2234	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2235	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tOverhead Tinker Bell shouted “Silly ass!” and darted into hiding. The
  2236	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tothers did not hear her. They had crowded round Wendy, and as they
  2237	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlooked a terrible silence fell upon the wood. If Wendy’s heart had been
  2238	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbeating they would all have heard it.
  2239	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2240	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tSlightly was the first to speak. “This is no bird,” he said in a scared
  2241	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tvoice. “I think this must be a lady.”
  2242	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2243	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“A lady?” said Tootles, and fell a-trembling.
  2244	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2245	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“And we have killed her,” Nibs said hoarsely.
  2246	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2247	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThey all whipped off their caps.
  2248	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2249	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Now I see,” Curly said: “Peter was bringing her to us.” He threw
  2250	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thimself sorrowfully on the ground.
  2251	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2252	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“A lady to take care of us at last,” said one of the twins, “and you
  2253	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thave killed her!”
  2254	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2255	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThey were sorry for him, but sorrier for themselves, and when he took a
  2256	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tstep nearer them they turned from him.
  2257	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2258	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tTootles’ face was very white, but there was a dignity about him now that
  2259	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thad never been there before.
  2260	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2261	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I did it,” he said, reflecting. “When ladies used to come to me in
  2262	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdreams, I said, ‘Pretty mother, pretty mother.’ But when at last she
  2263	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\treally came, I shot her.”
  2264	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2265	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe moved slowly away.
  2266	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2267	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Don’t go,” they called in pity.
  2268	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2269	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I must,” he answered, shaking; “I am so afraid of Peter.”
  2270	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2271	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIt was at this tragic moment that they heard a sound which made the
  2272	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\theart of every one of them rise to his mouth. They heard Peter crow.
  2273	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2274	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Peter!” they cried, for it was always thus that he signalled his
  2275	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\treturn.
  2276	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2277	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Hide her,” they whispered, and gathered hastily around Wendy. But
  2278	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tTootles stood aloof.
  2279	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2280	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAgain came that ringing crow, and Peter dropped in front of them.
  2281	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Greetings, boys,” he cried, and mechanically they saluted, and then
  2282	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tagain was silence.
  2283	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2284	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe frowned.
  2285	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2286	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I am back,” he said hotly, “why do you not cheer?”
  2287	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2288	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThey opened their mouths, but the cheers would not come. He overlooked
  2289	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tit in his haste to tell the glorious tidings.
  2290	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2291	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Great news, boys,” he cried, “I have brought at last a mother for you
  2292	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tall.”
  2293	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2294	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tStill no sound, except a little thud from Tootles as he dropped on his
  2295	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tknees.
  2296	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2297	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Have you not seen her?” asked Peter, becoming troubled. “She flew this
  2298	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tway.”
  2299	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2300	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Ah me!” one voice said, and another said, “Oh, mournful day.”
  2301	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2302	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tTootles rose. “Peter,” he said quietly, “I will show her to you,” and
  2303	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twhen the others would still have hidden her he said, “Back, twins, let
  2304	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPeter see.”
  2305	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2306	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tSo they all stood back, and let him see, and after he had looked for a
  2307	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlittle time he did not know what to do next.
  2308	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2309	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“She is dead,” he said uncomfortably. “Perhaps she is frightened at
  2310	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbeing dead.”
  2311	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2312	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe thought of hopping off in a comic sort of way till he was out of
  2313	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsight of her, and then never going near the spot any more. They would
  2314	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tall have been glad to follow if he had done this.
  2315	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2316	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tBut there was the arrow. He took it from her heart and faced his band.
  2317	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2318	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Whose arrow?” he demanded sternly.
  2319	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2320	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Mine, Peter,” said Tootles on his knees.
  2321	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2322	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Oh, dastard hand,” Peter said, and he raised the arrow to use it as a
  2323	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdagger.
  2324	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2325	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tTootles did not flinch. He bared his breast. “Strike, Peter,” he said
  2326	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfirmly, “strike true.”
  2327	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2328	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tTwice did Peter raise the arrow, and twice did his hand fall. “I cannot
  2329	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tstrike,” he said with awe, “there is something stays my hand.”
  2330	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2331	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAll looked at him in wonder, save Nibs, who fortunately looked at Wendy.
  2332	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2333	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“It is she,” he cried, “the Wendy lady, see, her arm!”
  2334	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2335	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWonderful to relate [tell], Wendy had raised her arm. Nibs bent over
  2336	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ther and listened reverently. “I think she said, ‘Poor Tootles,’” he
  2337	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twhispered.
  2338	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2339	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“She lives,” Peter said briefly.
  2340	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2341	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tSlightly cried instantly, “The Wendy lady lives.”
  2342	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2343	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThen Peter knelt beside her and found his button. You remember she had
  2344	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tput it on a chain that she wore round her neck.
  2345	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2346	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“See,” he said, “the arrow struck against this. It is the kiss I gave
  2347	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ther. It has saved her life.”
  2348	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2349	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I remember kisses,” Slightly interposed quickly, “let me see it. Ay,
  2350	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthat’s a kiss.”
  2351	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2352	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPeter did not hear him. He was begging Wendy to get better quickly, so
  2353	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthat he could show her the mermaids. Of course she could not answer yet,
  2354	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbeing still in a frightful faint; but from overhead came a wailing note.
  2355	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2356	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Listen to Tink,” said Curly, “she is crying because the Wendy lives.”
  2357	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2358	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThen they had to tell Peter of Tink’s crime, and almost never had they
  2359	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tseen him look so stern.
  2360	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2361	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Listen, Tinker Bell,” he cried, “I am your friend no more. Begone from
  2362	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tme for ever.”
  2363	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2364	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tShe flew on to his shoulder and pleaded, but he brushed her off. Not
  2365	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tuntil Wendy again raised her arm did he relent sufficiently to say,
  2366	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Well, not for ever, but for a whole week.”
  2367	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2368	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tDo you think Tinker Bell was grateful to Wendy for raising her arm? Oh
  2369	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdear no, never wanted to pinch her so much. Fairies indeed are strange,
  2370	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand Peter, who understood them best, often cuffed [slapped] them.
  2371	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2372	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tBut what to do with Wendy in her present delicate state of health?
  2373	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2374	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Let us carry her down into the house,” Curly suggested.
  2375	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2376	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Ay,” said Slightly, “that is what one does with ladies.”
  2377	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2378	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“No, no,” Peter said, “you must not touch her. It would not be
  2379	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsufficiently respectful.”
  2380	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2381	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“That,” said Slightly, “is what I was thinking.”
  2382	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2383	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“But if she lies there,” Tootles said, “she will die.”
  2384	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2385	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Ay, she will die,” Slightly admitted, “but there is no way out.”
  2386	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2387	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Yes, there is,” cried Peter. “Let us build a little house round her.”
  2388	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2389	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThey were all delighted. “Quick,” he ordered them, “bring me each of you
  2390	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe best of what we have. Gut our house. Be sharp.”
  2391	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2392	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIn a moment they were as busy as tailors the night before a wedding.
  2393	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThey skurried this way and that, down for bedding, up for firewood, and
  2394	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twhile they were at it, who should appear but John and Michael. As they
  2395	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdragged along the ground they fell asleep standing, stopped, woke up,
  2396	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmoved another step and slept again.
  2397	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2398	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“John, John,” Michael would cry, “wake up! Where is Nana, John, and
  2399	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmother?”
  2400	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2401	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAnd then John would rub his eyes and mutter, “It is true, we did fly.”
  2402	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2403	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tYou may be sure they were very relieved to find Peter.
  2404	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2405	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Hullo, Peter,” they said.
  2406	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2407	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Hullo,” replied Peter amicably, though he had quite forgotten them.
  2408	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe was very busy at the moment measuring Wendy with his feet to see
  2409	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thow large a house she would need. Of course he meant to leave room for
  2410	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tchairs and a table. John and Michael watched him.
  2411	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2412	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Is Wendy asleep?” they asked.
  2413	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2414	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Yes.”
  2415	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2416	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“John,” Michael proposed, “let us wake her and get her to make supper
  2417	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfor us,” but as he said it some of the other boys rushed on carrying
  2418	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbranches for the building of the house. “Look at them!” he cried.
  2419	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2420	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Curly,” said Peter in his most captainy voice, “see that these boys
  2421	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thelp in the building of the house.”
  2422	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2423	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Ay, ay, sir.”
  2424	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2425	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Build a house?” exclaimed John.
  2426	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2427	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“For the Wendy,” said Curly.
  2428	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2429	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“For Wendy?” John said, aghast. “Why, she is only a girl!”
  2430	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2431	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“That,” explained Curly, “is why we are her servants.”
  2432	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2433	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“You? Wendy’s servants!”
  2434	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2435	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Yes,” said Peter, “and you also. Away with them.”
  2436	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2437	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe astounded brothers were dragged away to hack and hew and carry.
  2438	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Chairs and a fender [fireplace] first,” Peter ordered. “Then we shall
  2439	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbuild a house round them.”
  2440	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2441	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Ay,” said Slightly, “that is how a house is built; it all comes back to
  2442	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tme.”
  2443	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2444	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPeter thought of everything. “Slightly,” he cried, “fetch a doctor.”
  2445	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2446	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Ay, ay,” said Slightly at once, and disappeared, scratching his head.
  2447	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tBut he knew Peter must be obeyed, and he returned in a moment, wearing
  2448	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tJohn’s hat and looking solemn.
  2449	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2450	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Please, sir,” said Peter, going to him, “are you a doctor?”
  2451	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2452	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe difference between him and the other boys at such a time was that
  2453	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthey knew it was make-believe, while to him make-believe and true were
  2454	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\texactly the same thing. This sometimes troubled them, as when they had
  2455	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tto make-believe that they had had their dinners.
  2456	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2457	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIf they broke down in their make-believe he rapped them on the knuckles.
  2458	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2459	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Yes, my little man,” Slightly anxiously replied, who had chapped
  2460	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tknuckles.
  2461	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2462	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Please, sir,” Peter explained, “a lady lies very ill.”
  2463	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2464	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tShe was lying at their feet, but Slightly had the sense not to see her.
  2465	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2466	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Tut, tut, tut,” he said, “where does she lie?”
  2467	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2468	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“In yonder glade.”
  2469	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2470	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I will put a glass thing in her mouth,” said Slightly, and he
  2471	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmade-believe to do it, while Peter waited. It was an anxious moment when
  2472	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe glass thing was withdrawn.
  2473	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2474	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“How is she?” inquired Peter.
  2475	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2476	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Tut, tut, tut,” said Slightly, “this has cured her.”
  2477	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2478	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I am glad!” Peter cried.
  2479	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2480	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I will call again in the evening,” Slightly said; “give her beef tea
  2481	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tout of a cup with a spout to it;” but after he had returned the hat
  2482	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tto John he blew big breaths, which was his habit on escaping from a
  2483	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdifficulty.
  2484	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2485	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIn the meantime the wood had been alive with the sound of axes; almost
  2486	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\teverything needed for a cosy dwelling already lay at Wendy’s feet.
  2487	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2488	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“If only we knew,” said one, “the kind of house she likes best.”
  2489	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2490	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Peter,” shouted another, “she is moving in her sleep.”
  2491	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2492	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Her mouth opens,” cried a third, looking respectfully into it. “Oh,
  2493	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlovely!”
  2494	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2495	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Perhaps she is going to sing in her sleep,” said Peter. “Wendy, sing
  2496	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe kind of house you would like to have.”
  2497	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2498	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tImmediately, without opening her eyes, Wendy began to sing:
  2499	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2500	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t     “I wish I had a pretty house,
  2501	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t     The littlest ever seen,
  2502	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t     With funny little red walls
  2503	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t     And roof of mossy green.”
  2504	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2505	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThey gurgled with joy at this, for by the greatest good luck the
  2506	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbranches they had brought were sticky with red sap, and all the ground
  2507	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twas carpeted with moss. As they rattled up the little house they broke
  2508	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tinto song themselves:
  2509	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2510	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t     “We’ve built the little walls and roof
  2511	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t     And made a lovely door,
  2512	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t     So tell us, mother Wendy,
  2513	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t     What are you wanting more?”
  2514	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2515	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tTo this she answered greedily:
  2516	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2517	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t     “Oh, really next I think I’ll have
  2518	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t     Gay windows all about,
  2519	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t     With roses peeping in, you know,
  2520	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t     And babies peeping out.”
  2521	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2522	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWith a blow of their fists they made windows, and large yellow leaves
  2523	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twere the blinds. But roses--?
  2524	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2525	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Roses,” cried Peter sternly.
  2526	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2527	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tQuickly they made-believe to grow the loveliest roses up the walls.
  2528	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2529	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tBabies?
  2530	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2531	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tTo prevent Peter ordering babies they hurried into song again:
  2532	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2533	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t     “We’ve made the roses peeping out,
  2534	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t     The babes are at the door,
  2535	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t     We cannot make ourselves, you know,
  2536	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t     ‘cos we’ve been made before.”
  2537	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2538	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPeter, seeing this to be a good idea, at once pretended that it was his
  2539	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\town. The house was quite beautiful, and no doubt Wendy was very cosy
  2540	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twithin, though, of course, they could no longer see her. Peter strode
  2541	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tup and down, ordering finishing touches. Nothing escaped his eagle eyes.
  2542	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tJust when it seemed absolutely finished:
  2543	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2544	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“There’s no knocker on the door,” he said.
  2545	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2546	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThey were very ashamed, but Tootles gave the sole of his shoe, and it
  2547	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmade an excellent knocker.
  2548	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2549	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAbsolutely finished now, they thought.
  2550	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2551	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNot of bit of it. “There’s no chimney,” Peter said; “we must have a
  2552	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tchimney.”
  2553	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2554	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“It certainly does need a chimney,” said John importantly. This gave
  2555	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPeter an idea. He snatched the hat off John’s head, knocked out the
  2556	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbottom [top], and put the hat on the roof. The little house was so
  2557	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tpleased to have such a capital chimney that, as if to say thank you,
  2558	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsmoke immediately began to come out of the hat.
  2559	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2560	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNow really and truly it was finished. Nothing remained to do but to
  2561	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tknock.
  2562	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2563	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“All look your best,” Peter warned them; “first impressions are awfully
  2564	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\timportant.”
  2565	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2566	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe was glad no one asked him what first impressions are; they were all
  2567	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttoo busy looking their best.
  2568	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2569	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe knocked politely, and now the wood was as still as the children, not
  2570	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ta sound to be heard except from Tinker Bell, who was watching from a
  2571	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbranch and openly sneering.
  2572	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2573	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWhat the boys were wondering was, would any one answer the knock? If a
  2574	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlady, what would she be like?
  2575	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2576	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe door opened and a lady came out. It was Wendy. They all whipped off
  2577	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttheir hats.
  2578	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2579	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tShe looked properly surprised, and this was just how they had hoped she
  2580	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twould look.
  2581	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2582	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Where am I?” she said.
  2583	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2584	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tOf course Slightly was the first to get his word in. “Wendy lady,” he
  2585	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsaid rapidly, “for you we built this house.”
  2586	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2587	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Oh, say you’re pleased,” cried Nibs.
  2588	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2589	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Lovely, darling house,” Wendy said, and they were the very words they
  2590	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thad hoped she would say.
  2591	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2592	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“And we are your children,” cried the twins.
  2593	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2594	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThen all went on their knees, and holding out their arms cried, “O Wendy
  2595	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlady, be our mother.”
  2596	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2597	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Ought I?” Wendy said, all shining. “Of course it’s frightfully
  2598	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfascinating, but you see I am only a little girl. I have no real
  2599	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\texperience.”
  2600	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2601	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“That doesn’t matter,” said Peter, as if he were the only person present
  2602	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twho knew all about it, though he was really the one who knew least.
  2603	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“What we need is just a nice motherly person.”
  2604	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2605	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Oh dear!” Wendy said, “you see, I feel that is exactly what I am.”
  2606	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2607	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“It is, it is,” they all cried; “we saw it at once.”
  2608	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2609	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Very well,” she said, “I will do my best. Come inside at once, you
  2610	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnaughty children; I am sure your feet are damp. And before I put you to
  2611	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbed I have just time to finish the story of Cinderella.”
  2612	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2613	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIn they went; I don’t know how there was room for them, but you can
  2614	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsqueeze very tight in the Neverland. And that was the first of the many
  2615	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tjoyous evenings they had with Wendy. By and by she tucked them up in the
  2616	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tgreat bed in the home under the trees, but she herself slept that night
  2617	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tin the little house, and Peter kept watch outside with drawn sword, for
  2618	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe pirates could be heard carousing far away and the wolves were on the
  2619	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tprowl. The little house looked so cosy and safe in the darkness, with
  2620	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ta bright light showing through its blinds, and the chimney smoking
  2621	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbeautifully, and Peter standing on guard. After a time he fell asleep,
  2622	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand some unsteady fairies had to climb over him on their way home from
  2623	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tan orgy. Any of the other boys obstructing the fairy path at night they
  2624	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twould have mischiefed, but they just tweaked Peter’s nose and passed on.
  2625	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2626	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t

  2628	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2629	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tChapter 7 THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND
  2630	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2631	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tOne of the first things Peter did next day was to measure Wendy and John
  2632	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand Michael for hollow trees. Hook, you remember, had sneered at the
  2633	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tboys for thinking they needed a tree apiece, but this was ignorance, for
  2634	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tunless your tree fitted you it was difficult to go up and down, and no
  2635	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttwo of the boys were quite the same size. Once you fitted, you drew in
  2636	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t[let out] your breath at the top, and down you went at exactly the
  2637	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tright speed, while to ascend you drew in and let out alternately, and so
  2638	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twriggled up. Of course, when you have mastered the action you are able
  2639	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tto do these things without thinking of them, and nothing can be more
  2640	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tgraceful.
  2641	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2642	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tBut you simply must fit, and Peter measures you for your tree as
  2643	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcarefully as for a suit of clothes: the only difference being that the
  2644	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tclothes are made to fit you, while you have to be made to fit the tree.
  2645	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tUsually it is done quite easily, as by your wearing too many garments
  2646	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tor too few, but if you are bumpy in awkward places or the only available
  2647	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttree is an odd shape, Peter does some things to you, and after that you
  2648	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfit. Once you fit, great care must be taken to go on fitting, and this,
  2649	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tas Wendy was to discover to her delight, keeps a whole family in perfect
  2650	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcondition.
  2651	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2652	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWendy and Michael fitted their trees at the first try, but John had to
  2653	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbe altered a little.
  2654	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2655	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAfter a few days’ practice they could go up and down as gaily as buckets
  2656	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tin a well. And how ardently they grew to love their home under the
  2657	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tground; especially Wendy. It consisted of one large room, as all houses
  2658	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tshould do, with a floor in which you could dig [for worms] if you wanted
  2659	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tto go fishing, and in this floor grew stout mushrooms of a charming
  2660	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcolour, which were used as stools. A Never tree tried hard to grow in
  2661	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe centre of the room, but every morning they sawed the trunk through,
  2662	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlevel with the floor. By tea-time it was always about two feet high, and
  2663	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthen they put a door on top of it, the whole thus becoming a table;
  2664	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tas soon as they cleared away, they sawed off the trunk again, and thus
  2665	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthere was more room to play. There was an enormous fireplace which was
  2666	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tin almost any part of the room where you cared to light it, and across
  2667	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthis Wendy stretched strings, made of fibre, from which she suspended
  2668	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ther washing. The bed was tilted against the wall by day, and let down at
  2669	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t6:30, when it filled nearly half the room; and all the boys slept in it,
  2670	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\texcept Michael, lying like sardines in a tin. There was a strict rule
  2671	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tagainst turning round until one gave the signal, when all turned at
  2672	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tonce. Michael should have used it also, but Wendy would have [desired]
  2673	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ta baby, and he was the littlest, and you know what women are, and the
  2674	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tshort and long of it is that he was hung up in a basket.
  2675	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2676	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIt was rough and simple, and not unlike what baby bears would have made
  2677	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tof an underground house in the same circumstances. But there was one
  2678	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\trecess in the wall, no larger than a bird-cage, which was the private
  2679	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tapartment of Tinker Bell. It could be shut off from the rest of
  2680	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe house by a tiny curtain, which Tink, who was most fastidious
  2681	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t[particular], always kept drawn when dressing or undressing. No woman,
  2682	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thowever large, could have had a more exquisite boudoir [dressing room]
  2683	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand bed-chamber combined. The couch, as she always called it, was
  2684	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ta genuine Queen Mab, with club legs; and she varied the bedspreads
  2685	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\taccording to what fruit-blossom was in season. Her mirror was a
  2686	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPuss-in-Boots, of which there are now only three, unchipped, known to
  2687	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfairy dealers; the washstand was Pie-crust and reversible, the chest
  2688	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tof drawers an authentic Charming the Sixth, and the carpet and rugs the
  2689	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbest (the early) period of Margery and Robin. There was a chandelier
  2690	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfrom Tiddlywinks for the look of the thing, but of course she lit the
  2691	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tresidence herself. Tink was very contemptuous of the rest of the house,
  2692	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tas indeed was perhaps inevitable, and her chamber, though beautiful,
  2693	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlooked rather conceited, having the appearance of a nose permanently
  2694	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tturned up.
  2695	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2696	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tI suppose it was all especially entrancing to Wendy, because those
  2697	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\trampagious boys of hers gave her so much to do. Really there were whole
  2698	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tweeks when, except perhaps with a stocking in the evening, she was never
  2699	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tabove ground. The cooking, I can tell you, kept her nose to the pot, and
  2700	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\teven if there was nothing in it, even if there was no pot, she had to
  2701	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tkeep watching that it came aboil just the same. You never exactly
  2702	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tknew whether there would be a real meal or just a make-believe, it all
  2703	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdepended upon Peter’s whim: he could eat, really eat, if it was part of
  2704	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ta game, but he could not stodge [cram down the food] just to feel
  2705	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tstodgy [stuffed with food], which is what most children like better than
  2706	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tanything else; the next best thing being to talk about it. Make-believe
  2707	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twas so real to him that during a meal of it you could see him getting
  2708	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\trounder. Of course it was trying, but you simply had to follow his lead,
  2709	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand if you could prove to him that you were getting loose for your tree
  2710	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\the let you stodge.
  2711	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2712	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWendy’s favourite time for sewing and darning was after they had all
  2713	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tgone to bed. Then, as she expressed it, she had a breathing time for
  2714	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\therself; and she occupied it in making new things for them, and putting
  2715	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdouble pieces on the knees, for they were all most frightfully hard on
  2716	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttheir knees.
  2717	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2718	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWhen she sat down to a basketful of their stockings, every heel with a
  2719	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thole in it, she would fling up her arms and exclaim, “Oh dear, I am sure
  2720	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tI sometimes think spinsters are to be envied!”
  2721	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2722	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHer face beamed when she exclaimed this.
  2723	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2724	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tYou remember about her pet wolf. Well, it very soon discovered that she
  2725	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thad come to the island and it found her out, and they just ran into each
  2726	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tother’s arms. After that it followed her about everywhere.
  2727	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2728	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAs time wore on did she think much about the beloved parents she had
  2729	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tleft behind her? This is a difficult question, because it is quite
  2730	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\timpossible to say how time does wear on in the Neverland, where it is
  2731	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcalculated by moons and suns, and there are ever so many more of them
  2732	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthan on the mainland. But I am afraid that Wendy did not really worry
  2733	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tabout her father and mother; she was absolutely confident that they
  2734	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twould always keep the window open for her to fly back by, and this gave
  2735	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ther complete ease of mind. What did disturb her at times was that John
  2736	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tremembered his parents vaguely only, as people he had once known, while
  2737	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tMichael was quite willing to believe that she was really his mother.
  2738	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThese things scared her a little, and nobly anxious to do her duty, she
  2739	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttried to fix the old life in their minds by setting them examination
  2740	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tpapers on it, as like as possible to the ones she used to do at school.
  2741	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe other boys thought this awfully interesting, and insisted on
  2742	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tjoining, and they made slates for themselves, and sat round the table,
  2743	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twriting and thinking hard about the questions she had written on another
  2744	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tslate and passed round. They were the most ordinary questions--“What
  2745	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twas the colour of Mother’s eyes? Which was taller, Father or Mother? Was
  2746	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tMother blonde or brunette? Answer all three questions if possible.”
  2747	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t “(A) Write an essay of not less than 40 words on How I spent my last
  2748	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHolidays, or The Characters of Father and Mother compared. Only one of
  2749	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthese to be attempted.” Or “(1) Describe Mother’s laugh; (2) Describe
  2750	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tFather’s laugh; (3) Describe Mother’s Party Dress; (4) Describe the
  2751	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tKennel and its Inmate.”
  2752	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2753	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThey were just everyday questions like these, and when you could not
  2754	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tanswer them you were told to make a cross; and it was really dreadful
  2755	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twhat a number of crosses even John made. Of course the only boy who
  2756	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\treplied to every question was Slightly, and no one could have been more
  2757	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thopeful of coming out first, but his answers were perfectly ridiculous,
  2758	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand he really came out last: a melancholy thing.
  2759	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2760	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPeter did not compete. For one thing he despised all mothers except
  2761	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWendy, and for another he was the only boy on the island who could
  2762	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tneither write nor spell; not the smallest word. He was above all that
  2763	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsort of thing.
  2764	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2765	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tBy the way, the questions were all written in the past tense. What
  2766	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twas the colour of Mother’s eyes, and so on. Wendy, you see, had been
  2767	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tforgetting, too.
  2768	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2769	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAdventures, of course, as we shall see, were of daily occurrence; but
  2770	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tabout this time Peter invented, with Wendy’s help, a new game that
  2771	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfascinated him enormously, until he suddenly had no more interest in it,
  2772	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twhich, as you have been told, was what always happened with his games.
  2773	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIt consisted in pretending not to have adventures, in doing the sort of
  2774	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthing John and Michael had been doing all their lives, sitting on stools
  2775	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tflinging balls in the air, pushing each other, going out for walks and
  2776	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcoming back without having killed so much as a grizzly. To see Peter
  2777	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdoing nothing on a stool was a great sight; he could not help looking
  2778	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsolemn at such times, to sit still seemed to him such a comic thing to
  2779	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdo. He boasted that he had gone walking for the good of his health. For
  2780	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tseveral suns these were the most novel of all adventures to him; and
  2781	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tJohn and Michael had to pretend to be delighted also; otherwise he would
  2782	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thave treated them severely.
  2783	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2784	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe often went out alone, and when he came back you were never absolutely
  2785	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcertain whether he had had an adventure or not. He might have forgotten
  2786	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tit so completely that he said nothing about it; and then when you went
  2787	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tout you found the body; and, on the other hand, he might say a great
  2788	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdeal about it, and yet you could not find the body. Sometimes he came
  2789	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thome with his head bandaged, and then Wendy cooed over him and bathed
  2790	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tit in lukewarm water, while he told a dazzling tale. But she was never
  2791	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tquite sure, you know. There were, however, many adventures which she
  2792	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tknew to be true because she was in them herself, and there were still
  2793	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmore that were at least partly true, for the other boys were in them and
  2794	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsaid they were wholly true. To describe them all would require a book as
  2795	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlarge as an English-Latin, Latin-English Dictionary, and the most we can
  2796	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdo is to give one as a specimen of an average hour on the island. The
  2797	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdifficulty is which one to choose. Should we take the brush with the
  2798	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tredskins at Slightly Gulch? It was a sanguinary affair, and
  2799	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tespecially interesting as showing one of Peter’s peculiarities, which
  2800	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twas that in the middle of a fight he would suddenly change sides. At the
  2801	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tGulch, when victory was still in the balance, sometimes leaning this way
  2802	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand sometimes that, he called out, “I’m redskin to-day; what are you,
  2803	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tTootles?” And Tootles answered, “Redskin; what are you, Nibs?” and
  2804	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNibs said, “Redskin; what are you Twin?” and so on; and they were all
  2805	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tredskins; and of course this would have ended the fight had not the real
  2806	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tredskins fascinated by Peter’s methods, agreed to be lost boys for that
  2807	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tonce, and so at it they all went again, more fiercely than ever.
  2808	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2809	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe extraordinary upshot of this adventure was--but we have not decided
  2810	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tyet that this is the adventure we are to narrate. Perhaps a better one
  2811	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twould be the night attack by the redskins on the house under the ground,
  2812	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twhen several of them stuck in the hollow trees and had to be pulled out
  2813	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlike corks. Or we might tell how Peter saved Tiger Lily’s life in the
  2814	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tMermaids’ Lagoon, and so made her his ally.
  2815	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2816	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tOr we could tell of that cake the pirates cooked so that the boys might
  2817	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\teat it and perish; and how they placed it in one cunning spot after
  2818	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tanother; but always Wendy snatched it from the hands of her children, so
  2819	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthat in time it lost its succulence, and became as hard as a stone, and
  2820	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twas used as a missile, and Hook fell over it in the dark.
  2821	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2822	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tOr suppose we tell of the birds that were Peter’s friends, particularly
  2823	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tof the Never bird that built in a tree overhanging the lagoon, and how
  2824	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe nest fell into the water, and still the bird sat on her eggs, and
  2825	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPeter gave orders that she was not to be disturbed. That is a pretty
  2826	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tstory, and the end shows how grateful a bird can be; but if we tell
  2827	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tit we must also tell the whole adventure of the lagoon, which would
  2828	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tof course be telling two adventures rather than just one. A shorter
  2829	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tadventure, and quite as exciting, was Tinker Bell’s attempt, with the
  2830	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thelp of some street fairies, to have the sleeping Wendy conveyed on a
  2831	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tgreat floating leaf to the mainland. Fortunately the leaf gave way and
  2832	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWendy woke, thinking it was bath-time, and swam back. Or again, we might
  2833	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tchoose Peter’s defiance of the lions, when he drew a circle round him
  2834	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ton the ground with an arrow and dared them to cross it; and though he
  2835	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twaited for hours, with the other boys and Wendy looking on breathlessly
  2836	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfrom trees, not one of them dared to accept his challenge.
  2837	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2838	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWhich of these adventures shall we choose? The best way will be to toss
  2839	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfor it.
  2840	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2841	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tI have tossed, and the lagoon has won. This almost makes one wish that
  2842	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe gulch or the cake or Tink’s leaf had won. Of course I could do it
  2843	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tagain, and make it best out of three; however, perhaps fairest to stick
  2844	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tto the lagoon.

  2849	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tChapter 8 THE MERMAIDS’ LAGOON
  2850	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2851	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIf you shut your eyes and are a lucky one, you may see at times a
  2852	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tshapeless pool of lovely pale colours suspended in the darkness; then
  2853	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tif you squeeze your eyes tighter, the pool begins to take shape, and the
  2854	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcolours become so vivid that with another squeeze they must go on fire.
  2855	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tBut just before they go on fire you see the lagoon. This is the nearest
  2856	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tyou ever get to it on the mainland, just one heavenly moment; if there
  2857	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcould be two moments you might see the surf and hear the mermaids
  2858	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsinging.
  2859	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2860	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe children often spent long summer days on this lagoon, swimming or
  2861	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfloating most of the time, playing the mermaid games in the water,
  2862	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand so forth. You must not think from this that the mermaids were on
  2863	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfriendly terms with them: on the contrary, it was among Wendy’s lasting
  2864	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tregrets that all the time she was on the island she never had a civil
  2865	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tword from one of them. When she stole softly to the edge of the lagoon
  2866	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tshe might see them by the score, especially on Marooners’ Rock, where
  2867	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthey loved to bask, combing out their hair in a lazy way that quite
  2868	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tirritated her; or she might even swim, on tiptoe as it were, to within
  2869	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ta yard of them, but then they saw her and dived, probably splashing her
  2870	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twith their tails, not by accident, but intentionally.
  2871	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2872	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThey treated all the boys in the same way, except of course Peter, who
  2873	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tchatted with them on Marooners’ Rock by the hour, and sat on their tails
  2874	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twhen they got cheeky. He gave Wendy one of their combs.
  2875	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2876	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe most haunting time at which to see them is at the turn of the moon,
  2877	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twhen they utter strange wailing cries; but the lagoon is dangerous for
  2878	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmortals then, and until the evening of which we have now to tell, Wendy
  2879	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thad never seen the lagoon by moonlight, less from fear, for of course
  2880	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPeter would have accompanied her, than because she had strict rules
  2881	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tabout every one being in bed by seven. She was often at the lagoon,
  2882	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thowever, on sunny days after rain, when the mermaids come up in
  2883	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\textraordinary numbers to play with their bubbles. The bubbles of many
  2884	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcolours made in rainbow water they treat as balls, hitting them gaily
  2885	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfrom one to another with their tails, and trying to keep them in the
  2886	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\trainbow till they burst. The goals are at each end of the rainbow, and
  2887	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe keepers only are allowed to use their hands. Sometimes a dozen of
  2888	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthese games will be going on in the lagoon at a time, and it is quite a
  2889	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tpretty sight.
  2890	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2891	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tBut the moment the children tried to join in they had to play by
  2892	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthemselves, for the mermaids immediately disappeared. Nevertheless we
  2893	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thave proof that they secretly watched the interlopers, and were not
  2894	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tabove taking an idea from them; for John introduced a new way of hitting
  2895	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe bubble, with the head instead of the hand, and the mermaids adopted
  2896	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tit. This is the one mark that John has left on the Neverland.
  2897	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2898	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIt must also have been rather pretty to see the children resting on a
  2899	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\trock for half an hour after their mid-day meal. Wendy insisted on
  2900	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttheir doing this, and it had to be a real rest even though the meal was
  2901	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmake-believe. So they lay there in the sun, and their bodies glistened
  2902	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tin it, while she sat beside them and looked important.
  2903	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2904	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIt was one such day, and they were all on Marooners’ Rock. The rock was
  2905	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnot much larger than their great bed, but of course they all knew how
  2906	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnot to take up much room, and they were dozing, or at least lying with
  2907	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttheir eyes shut, and pinching occasionally when they thought Wendy was
  2908	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnot looking. She was very busy, stitching.
  2909	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2910	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWhile she stitched a change came to the lagoon. Little shivers ran over
  2911	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tit, and the sun went away and shadows stole across the water, turning
  2912	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tit cold. Wendy could no longer see to thread her needle, and when she
  2913	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlooked up, the lagoon that had always hitherto been such a laughing
  2914	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tplace seemed formidable and unfriendly.
  2915	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2916	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIt was not, she knew, that night had come, but something as dark as
  2917	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnight had come. No, worse than that. It had not come, but it had sent
  2918	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthat shiver through the sea to say that it was coming. What was it?
  2919	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2920	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThere crowded upon her all the stories she had been told of Marooners’
  2921	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tRock, so called because evil captains put sailors on it and leave
  2922	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthem there to drown. They drown when the tide rises, for then it is
  2923	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsubmerged.
  2924	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2925	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tOf course she should have roused the children at once; not merely
  2926	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbecause of the unknown that was stalking toward them, but because it was
  2927	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tno longer good for them to sleep on a rock grown chilly. But she was
  2928	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ta young mother and she did not know this; she thought you simply must
  2929	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tstick to your rule about half an hour after the mid-day meal. So, though
  2930	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfear was upon her, and she longed to hear male voices, she would not
  2931	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twaken them. Even when she heard the sound of muffled oars, though her
  2932	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\theart was in her mouth, she did not waken them. She stood over them to
  2933	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlet them have their sleep out. Was it not brave of Wendy?
  2934	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2935	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIt was well for those boys then that there was one among them who could
  2936	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsniff danger even in his sleep. Peter sprang erect, as wide awake at
  2937	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tonce as a dog, and with one warning cry he roused the others.
  2938	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2939	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe stood motionless, one hand to his ear.
  2940	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2941	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Pirates!” he cried. The others came closer to him. A strange smile was
  2942	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tplaying about his face, and Wendy saw it and shuddered. While that smile
  2943	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twas on his face no one dared address him; all they could do was to stand
  2944	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tready to obey. The order came sharp and incisive.
  2945	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2946	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Dive!”
  2947	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2948	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThere was a gleam of legs, and instantly the lagoon seemed deserted.
  2949	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tMarooners’ Rock stood alone in the forbidding waters as if it were
  2950	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\titself marooned.
  2951	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2952	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe boat drew nearer. It was the pirate dinghy, with three figures in
  2953	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ther, Smee and Starkey, and the third a captive, no other than Tiger
  2954	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tLily. Her hands and ankles were tied, and she knew what was to be her
  2955	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfate. She was to be left on the rock to perish, an end to one of her
  2956	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\trace more terrible than death by fire or torture, for is it not written
  2957	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tin the book of the tribe that there is no path through water to the
  2958	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thappy hunting-ground? Yet her face was impassive; she was the daughter
  2959	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tof a chief, she must die as a chief’s daughter, it is enough.
  2960	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2961	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThey had caught her boarding the pirate ship with a knife in her mouth.
  2962	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNo watch was kept on the ship, it being Hook’s boast that the wind of
  2963	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\this name guarded the ship for a mile around. Now her fate would help to
  2964	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tguard it also. One more wail would go the round in that wind by night.
  2965	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2966	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIn the gloom that they brought with them the two pirates did not see the
  2967	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\trock till they crashed into it.
  2968	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2969	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Luff, you lubber,” cried an Irish voice that was Smee’s; “here’s the
  2970	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\trock. Now, then, what we have to do is to hoist the redskin on to it and
  2971	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tleave her here to drown.”
  2972	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2973	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIt was the work of one brutal moment to land the beautiful girl on the
  2974	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\trock; she was too proud to offer a vain resistance.
  2975	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2976	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tQuite near the rock, but out of sight, two heads were bobbing up and
  2977	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdown, Peter’s and Wendy’s. Wendy was crying, for it was the first
  2978	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttragedy she had seen. Peter had seen many tragedies, but he had
  2979	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tforgotten them all. He was less sorry than Wendy for Tiger Lily: it was
  2980	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttwo against one that angered him, and he meant to save her. An easy way
  2981	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twould have been to wait until the pirates had gone, but he was never one
  2982	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tto choose the easy way.
  2983	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2984	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThere was almost nothing he could not do, and he now imitated the voice
  2985	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tof Hook.
  2986	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2987	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Ahoy there, you lubbers!” he called. It was a marvellous imitation.
  2988	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2989	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“The captain!” said the pirates, staring at each other in surprise.
  2990	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2991	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“He must be swimming out to us,” Starkey said, when they had looked for
  2992	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thim in vain.
  2993	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2994	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“We are putting the redskin on the rock,” Smee called out.
  2995	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2996	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Set her free,” came the astonishing answer.
  2997	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  2998	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Free!”
  2999	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3000	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Yes, cut her bonds and let her go.”
  3001	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3002	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“But, captain--”
  3003	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3004	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“At once, d’ye hear,” cried Peter, “or I’ll plunge my hook in you.”
  3005	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3006	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“This is queer!” Smee gasped.
  3007	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3008	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Better do what the captain orders,” said Starkey nervously.
  3009	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3010	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Ay, ay,” Smee said, and he cut Tiger Lily’s cords. At once like an eel
  3011	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tshe slid between Starkey’s legs into the water.
  3012	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3013	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tOf course Wendy was very elated over Peter’s cleverness; but she knew
  3014	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthat he would be elated also and very likely crow and thus betray
  3015	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thimself, so at once her hand went out to cover his mouth. But it was
  3016	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tstayed even in the act, for “Boat ahoy!” rang over the lagoon in Hook’s
  3017	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tvoice, and this time it was not Peter who had spoken.
  3018	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3019	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPeter may have been about to crow, but his face puckered in a whistle of
  3020	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsurprise instead.
  3021	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3022	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Boat ahoy!” again came the voice.
  3023	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3024	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNow Wendy understood. The real Hook was also in the water.
  3025	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3026	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe was swimming to the boat, and as his men showed a light to guide him
  3027	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\the had soon reached them. In the light of the lantern Wendy saw his hook
  3028	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tgrip the boat’s side; she saw his evil swarthy face as he rose dripping
  3029	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfrom the water, and, quaking, she would have liked to swim away, but
  3030	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPeter would not budge. He was tingling with life and also top-heavy with
  3031	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tconceit. “Am I not a wonder, oh, I am a wonder!” he whispered to her,
  3032	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand though she thought so also, she was really glad for the sake of his
  3033	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\treputation that no one heard him except herself.
  3034	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3035	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe signed to her to listen.
  3036	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3037	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe two pirates were very curious to know what had brought their captain
  3038	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tto them, but he sat with his head on his hook in a position of profound
  3039	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmelancholy.
  3040	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3041	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Captain, is all well?” they asked timidly, but he answered with a
  3042	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thollow moan.
  3043	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3044	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“He sighs,” said Smee.
  3045	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3046	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“He sighs again,” said Starkey.
  3047	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3048	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“And yet a third time he sighs,” said Smee.
  3049	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3050	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThen at last he spoke passionately.
  3051	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3052	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“The game’s up,” he cried, “those boys have found a mother.”
  3053	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3054	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAffrighted though she was, Wendy swelled with pride.
  3055	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3056	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“O evil day!” cried Starkey.
  3057	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3058	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“What’s a mother?” asked the ignorant Smee.
  3059	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3060	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWendy was so shocked that she exclaimed. “He doesn’t know!” and always
  3061	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tafter this she felt that if you could have a pet pirate Smee would be
  3062	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ther one.
  3063	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3064	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPeter pulled her beneath the water, for Hook had started up, crying,
  3065	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“What was that?”
  3066	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3067	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I heard nothing,” said Starkey, raising the lantern over the waters,
  3068	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand as the pirates looked they saw a strange sight. It was the nest I
  3069	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thave told you of, floating on the lagoon, and the Never bird was sitting
  3070	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ton it.
  3071	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3072	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“See,” said Hook in answer to Smee’s question, “that is a mother. What
  3073	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ta lesson! The nest must have fallen into the water, but would the mother
  3074	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdesert her eggs? No.”
  3075	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3076	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThere was a break in his voice, as if for a moment he recalled innocent
  3077	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdays when--but he brushed away this weakness with his hook.
  3078	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3079	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tSmee, much impressed, gazed at the bird as the nest was borne past, but
  3080	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe more suspicious Starkey said, “If she is a mother, perhaps she is
  3081	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thanging about here to help Peter.”
  3082	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3083	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHook winced. “Ay,” he said, “that is the fear that haunts me.”
  3084	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3085	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe was roused from this dejection by Smee’s eager voice.
  3086	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3087	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Captain,” said Smee, “could we not kidnap these boys’ mother and make
  3088	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ther our mother?”
  3089	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3090	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“It is a princely scheme,” cried Hook, and at once it took practical
  3091	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tshape in his great brain. “We will seize the children and carry them to
  3092	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe boat: the boys we will make walk the plank, and Wendy shall be our
  3093	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmother.”
  3094	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3095	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAgain Wendy forgot herself.
  3096	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3097	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Never!” she cried, and bobbed.
  3098	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3099	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“What was that?”
  3100	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3101	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tBut they could see nothing. They thought it must have been a leaf in the
  3102	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twind. “Do you agree, my bullies?” asked Hook.
  3103	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3104	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“There is my hand on it,” they both said.
  3105	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3106	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“And there is my hook. Swear.”
  3107	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3108	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThey all swore. By this time they were on the rock, and suddenly Hook
  3109	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tremembered Tiger Lily.
  3110	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3111	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Where is the redskin?” he demanded abruptly.
  3112	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3113	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe had a playful humour at moments, and they thought this was one of the
  3114	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmoments.
  3115	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3116	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“That is all right, captain,” Smee answered complacently; “we let her
  3117	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tgo.”
  3118	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3119	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Let her go!” cried Hook.
  3120	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3121	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“‘Twas your own orders,” the bo’sun faltered.
  3122	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3123	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“You called over the water to us to let her go,” said Starkey.
  3124	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3125	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Brimstone and gall,” thundered Hook, “what cozening [cheating] is
  3126	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tgoing on here!” His face had gone black with rage, but he saw that they
  3127	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbelieved their words, and he was startled. “Lads,” he said, shaking a
  3128	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlittle, “I gave no such order.”
  3129	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3130	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“It is passing queer,” Smee said, and they all fidgeted uncomfortably.
  3131	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHook raised his voice, but there was a quiver in it.
  3132	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3133	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Spirit that haunts this dark lagoon to-night,” he cried, “dost hear
  3134	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tme?”
  3135	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3136	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tOf course Peter should have kept quiet, but of course he did not. He
  3137	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\timmediately answered in Hook’s voice:
  3138	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3139	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Odds, bobs, hammer and tongs, I hear you.”
  3140	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3141	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIn that supreme moment Hook did not blanch, even at the gills, but Smee
  3142	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand Starkey clung to each other in terror.
  3143	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3144	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Who are you, stranger? Speak!” Hook demanded.
  3145	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3146	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I am James Hook,” replied the voice, “captain of the JOLLY ROGER.”
  3147	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3148	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“You are not; you are not,” Hook cried hoarsely.
  3149	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3150	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Brimstone and gall,” the voice retorted, “say that again, and I’ll cast
  3151	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tanchor in you.”
  3152	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3153	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHook tried a more ingratiating manner. “If you are Hook,” he said almost
  3154	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thumbly, “come tell me, who am I?”
  3155	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3156	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“A codfish,” replied the voice, “only a codfish.”
  3157	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3158	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“A codfish!” Hook echoed blankly, and it was then, but not till then,
  3159	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthat his proud spirit broke. He saw his men draw back from him.
  3160	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3161	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Have we been captained all this time by a codfish!” they muttered. “It
  3162	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tis lowering to our pride.”
  3163	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3164	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThey were his dogs snapping at him, but, tragic figure though he had
  3165	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbecome, he scarcely heeded them. Against such fearful evidence it was
  3166	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnot their belief in him that he needed, it was his own. He felt his ego
  3167	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tslipping from him. “Don’t desert me, bully,” he whispered hoarsely to
  3168	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tit.
  3169	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3170	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIn his dark nature there was a touch of the feminine, as in all the
  3171	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tgreat pirates, and it sometimes gave him intuitions. Suddenly he tried
  3172	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe guessing game.
  3173	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3174	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Hook,” he called, “have you another voice?”
  3175	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3176	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNow Peter could never resist a game, and he answered blithely in his own
  3177	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tvoice, “I have.”
  3178	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3179	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“And another name?”
  3180	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3181	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Ay, ay.”
  3182	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3183	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Vegetable?” asked Hook.
  3184	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3185	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“No.”
  3186	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3187	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Mineral?”
  3188	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3189	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“No.”
  3190	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3191	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Animal?”
  3192	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3193	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Yes.”
  3194	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3195	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Man?”
  3196	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3197	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“No!” This answer rang out scornfully.
  3198	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3199	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Boy?”
  3200	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3201	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Yes.”
  3202	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3203	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Ordinary boy?”
  3204	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3205	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“No!”
  3206	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3207	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Wonderful boy?”
  3208	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3209	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tTo Wendy’s pain the answer that rang out this time was “Yes.”
  3210	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3211	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Are you in England?”
  3212	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3213	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“No.”
  3214	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3215	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Are you here?”
  3216	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3217	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Yes.”
  3218	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3219	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHook was completely puzzled. “You ask him some questions,” he said to
  3220	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe others, wiping his damp brow.
  3221	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3222	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tSmee reflected. “I can’t think of a thing,” he said regretfully.
  3223	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3224	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Can’t guess, can’t guess!” crowed Peter. “Do you give it up?”
  3225	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3226	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tOf course in his pride he was carrying the game too far, and the
  3227	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmiscreants [villains] saw their chance.
  3228	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3229	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Yes, yes,” they answered eagerly.
  3230	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3231	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Well, then,” he cried, “I am Peter Pan.”
  3232	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3233	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPan!
  3234	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3235	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIn a moment Hook was himself again, and Smee and Starkey were his
  3236	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfaithful henchmen.
  3237	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3238	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Now we have him,” Hook shouted. “Into the water, Smee. Starkey, mind
  3239	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe boat. Take him dead or alive!”
  3240	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3241	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe leaped as he spoke, and simultaneously came the gay voice of Peter.
  3242	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3243	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Are you ready, boys?”
  3244	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3245	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Ay, ay,” from various parts of the lagoon.
  3246	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3247	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Then lam into the pirates.”
  3248	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3249	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe fight was short and sharp. First to draw blood was John, who
  3250	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tgallantly climbed into the boat and held Starkey. There was fierce
  3251	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tstruggle, in which the cutlass was torn from the pirate’s grasp. He
  3252	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twriggled overboard and John leapt after him. The dinghy drifted away.
  3253	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3254	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHere and there a head bobbed up in the water, and there was a flash
  3255	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tof steel followed by a cry or a whoop. In the confusion some struck at
  3256	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttheir own side. The corkscrew of Smee got Tootles in the fourth rib, but
  3257	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\the was himself pinked [nicked] in turn by Curly. Farther from the rock
  3258	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tStarkey was pressing Slightly and the twins hard.
  3259	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3260	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWhere all this time was Peter? He was seeking bigger game.
  3261	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3262	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe others were all brave boys, and they must not be blamed for backing
  3263	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfrom the pirate captain. His iron claw made a circle of dead water round
  3264	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thim, from which they fled like affrighted fishes.
  3265	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3266	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tBut there was one who did not fear him: there was one prepared to enter
  3267	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthat circle.
  3268	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3269	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tStrangely, it was not in the water that they met. Hook rose to the rock
  3270	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tto breathe, and at the same moment Peter scaled it on the opposite
  3271	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tside. The rock was slippery as a ball, and they had to crawl rather than
  3272	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tclimb. Neither knew that the other was coming. Each feeling for a grip
  3273	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmet the other’s arm: in surprise they raised their heads; their faces
  3274	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twere almost touching; so they met.
  3275	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3276	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tSome of the greatest heroes have confessed that just before they fell to
  3277	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t[began combat] they had a sinking [feeling in the stomach]. Had it been
  3278	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tso with Peter at that moment I would admit it. After all, he was the
  3279	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tonly man that the Sea-Cook had feared. But Peter had no sinking, he had
  3280	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tone feeling only, gladness; and he gnashed his pretty teeth with joy.
  3281	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tQuick as thought he snatched a knife from Hook’s belt and was about to
  3282	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdrive it home, when he saw that he was higher up the rock than his foe.
  3283	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIt would not have been fighting fair. He gave the pirate a hand to help
  3284	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thim up.
  3285	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3286	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIt was then that Hook bit him.
  3287	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3288	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNot the pain of this but its unfairness was what dazed Peter. It made
  3289	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thim quite helpless. He could only stare, horrified. Every child is
  3290	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\taffected thus the first time he is treated unfairly. All he thinks he
  3291	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thas a right to when he comes to you to be yours is fairness. After
  3292	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tyou have been unfair to him he will love you again, but will never
  3293	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tafterwards be quite the same boy. No one ever gets over the first
  3294	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tunfairness; no one except Peter. He often met it, but he always forgot
  3295	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tit. I suppose that was the real difference between him and all the rest.
  3296	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3297	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tSo when he met it now it was like the first time; and he could just
  3298	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tstare, helpless. Twice the iron hand clawed him.
  3299	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3300	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tA few moments afterwards the other boys saw Hook in the water striking
  3301	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twildly for the ship; no elation on the pestilent face now, only white
  3302	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfear, for the crocodile was in dogged pursuit of him. On ordinary
  3303	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\toccasions the boys would have swum alongside cheering; but now they were
  3304	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tuneasy, for they had lost both Peter and Wendy, and were scouring the
  3305	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlagoon for them, calling them by name. They found the dinghy and went
  3306	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thome in it, shouting “Peter, Wendy” as they went, but no answer came
  3307	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsave mocking laughter from the mermaids. “They must be swimming back or
  3308	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tflying,” the boys concluded. They were not very anxious, because they
  3309	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thad such faith in Peter. They chuckled, boylike, because they would be
  3310	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlate for bed; and it was all mother Wendy’s fault!
  3311	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3312	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWhen their voices died away there came cold silence over the lagoon, and
  3313	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthen a feeble cry.
  3314	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3315	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Help, help!”
  3316	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3317	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tTwo small figures were beating against the rock; the girl had fainted
  3318	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand lay on the boy’s arm. With a last effort Peter pulled her up the
  3319	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\trock and then lay down beside her. Even as he also fainted he saw that
  3320	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe water was rising. He knew that they would soon be drowned, but he
  3321	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcould do no more.
  3322	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3323	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAs they lay side by side a mermaid caught Wendy by the feet, and began
  3324	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tpulling her softly into the water. Peter, feeling her slip from him,
  3325	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twoke with a start, and was just in time to draw her back. But he had to
  3326	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttell her the truth.
  3327	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3328	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“We are on the rock, Wendy,” he said, “but it is growing smaller. Soon
  3329	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe water will be over it.”
  3330	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3331	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tShe did not understand even now.
  3332	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3333	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“We must go,” she said, almost brightly.
  3334	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3335	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Yes,” he answered faintly.
  3336	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3337	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Shall we swim or fly, Peter?”
  3338	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3339	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe had to tell her.
  3340	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3341	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Do you think you could swim or fly as far as the island, Wendy, without
  3342	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmy help?”
  3343	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3344	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tShe had to admit that she was too tired.
  3345	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3346	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe moaned.
  3347	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3348	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“What is it?” she asked, anxious about him at once.
  3349	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3350	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I can’t help you, Wendy. Hook wounded me. I can neither fly nor swim.”
  3351	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3352	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Do you mean we shall both be drowned?”
  3353	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3354	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Look how the water is rising.”
  3355	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3356	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThey put their hands over their eyes to shut out the sight. They thought
  3357	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthey would soon be no more. As they sat thus something brushed against
  3358	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPeter as light as a kiss, and stayed there, as if saying timidly, “Can I
  3359	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbe of any use?”
  3360	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3361	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIt was the tail of a kite, which Michael had made some days before. It
  3362	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thad torn itself out of his hand and floated away.
  3363	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3364	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Michael’s kite,” Peter said without interest, but next moment he had
  3365	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tseized the tail, and was pulling the kite toward him.
  3366	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3367	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“It lifted Michael off the ground,” he cried; “why should it not carry
  3368	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tyou?”
  3369	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3370	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Both of us!”
  3371	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3372	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“It can’t lift two; Michael and Curly tried.”
  3373	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3374	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Let us draw lots,” Wendy said bravely.
  3375	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3376	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“And you a lady; never.” Already he had tied the tail round her. She
  3377	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tclung to him; she refused to go without him; but with a “Good-bye,
  3378	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWendy,” he pushed her from the rock; and in a few minutes she was borne
  3379	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tout of his sight. Peter was alone on the lagoon.
  3380	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3381	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe rock was very small now; soon it would be submerged. Pale rays of
  3382	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlight tiptoed across the waters; and by and by there was to be heard a
  3383	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsound at once the most musical and the most melancholy in the world: the
  3384	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmermaids calling to the moon.
  3385	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3386	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPeter was not quite like other boys; but he was afraid at last. A
  3387	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttremour ran through him, like a shudder passing over the sea; but on
  3388	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe sea one shudder follows another till there are hundreds of them, and
  3389	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPeter felt just the one. Next moment he was standing erect on the rock
  3390	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tagain, with that smile on his face and a drum beating within him. It was
  3391	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsaying, “To die will be an awfully big adventure.”

  3396	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tChapter 9 THE NEVER BIRD
  3397	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3398	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe last sound Peter heard before he was quite alone were the mermaids
  3399	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tretiring one by one to their bedchambers under the sea. He was too far
  3400	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\taway to hear their doors shut; but every door in the coral caves where
  3401	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthey live rings a tiny bell when it opens or closes (as in all the
  3402	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnicest houses on the mainland), and he heard the bells.
  3403	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3404	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tSteadily the waters rose till they were nibbling at his feet; and to
  3405	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tpass the time until they made their final gulp, he watched the only
  3406	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthing on the lagoon. He thought it was a piece of floating paper,
  3407	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tperhaps part of the kite, and wondered idly how long it would take to
  3408	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdrift ashore.
  3409	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3410	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPresently he noticed as an odd thing that it was undoubtedly out upon
  3411	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe lagoon with some definite purpose, for it was fighting the tide,
  3412	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand sometimes winning; and when it won, Peter, always sympathetic to
  3413	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe weaker side, could not help clapping; it was such a gallant piece of
  3414	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tpaper.
  3415	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3416	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIt was not really a piece of paper; it was the Never bird, making
  3417	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdesperate efforts to reach Peter on the nest. By working her wings, in a
  3418	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tway she had learned since the nest fell into the water, she was able to
  3419	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsome extent to guide her strange craft, but by the time Peter recognised
  3420	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ther she was very exhausted. She had come to save him, to give him her
  3421	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnest, though there were eggs in it. I rather wonder at the bird, for
  3422	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthough he had been nice to her, he had also sometimes tormented her. I
  3423	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcan suppose only that, like Mrs. Darling and the rest of them, she was
  3424	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmelted because he had all his first teeth.
  3425	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3426	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tShe called out to him what she had come for, and he called out to her
  3427	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twhat she was doing there; but of course neither of them understood
  3428	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe other’s language. In fanciful stories people can talk to the birds
  3429	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfreely, and I wish for the moment I could pretend that this were such a
  3430	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tstory, and say that Peter replied intelligently to the Never bird; but
  3431	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttruth is best, and I want to tell you only what really happened. Well,
  3432	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnot only could they not understand each other, but they forgot their
  3433	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmanners.
  3434	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3435	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I--want--you--to--get--into--the--nest,” the bird called, speaking as
  3436	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tslowly and distinctly as possible, “and--then--you--can--drift--ashore,
  3437	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbut--I--am--too--tired--to--bring--it--any--nearer--so--you--must--try
  3438	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tto--swim--to--it.”
  3439	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3440	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“What are you quacking about?” Peter answered. “Why don’t you let the
  3441	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnest drift as usual?”
  3442	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3443	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I--want--you--” the bird said, and repeated it all over.
  3444	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3445	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThen Peter tried slow and distinct.
  3446	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3447	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“What--are--you--quacking--about?” and so on.
  3448	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3449	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe Never bird became irritated; they have very short tempers.
  3450	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3451	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“You dunderheaded little jay!” she screamed, “Why don’t you do as I tell
  3452	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tyou?”
  3453	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3454	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPeter felt that she was calling him names, and at a venture he retorted
  3455	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thotly:
  3456	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3457	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“So are you!”
  3458	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3459	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThen rather curiously they both snapped out the same remark:
  3460	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3461	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Shut up!”
  3462	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3463	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Shut up!”
  3464	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3465	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNevertheless the bird was determined to save him if she could, and by
  3466	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tone last mighty effort she propelled the nest against the rock. Then up
  3467	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tshe flew; deserting her eggs, so as to make her meaning clear.
  3468	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3469	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThen at last he understood, and clutched the nest and waved his thanks
  3470	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tto the bird as she fluttered overhead. It was not to receive his thanks,
  3471	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thowever, that she hung there in the sky; it was not even to watch him
  3472	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tget into the nest; it was to see what he did with her eggs.
  3473	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3474	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThere were two large white eggs, and Peter lifted them up and reflected.
  3475	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe bird covered her face with her wings, so as not to see the last of
  3476	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthem; but she could not help peeping between the feathers.
  3477	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3478	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tI forget whether I have told you that there was a stave on the rock,
  3479	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdriven into it by some buccaneers of long ago to mark the site of buried
  3480	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttreasure. The children had discovered the glittering hoard, and when in
  3481	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ta mischievous mood used to fling showers of moidores, diamonds, pearls
  3482	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand pieces of eight to the gulls, who pounced upon them for food, and
  3483	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthen flew away, raging at the scurvy trick that had been played upon
  3484	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthem. The stave was still there, and on it Starkey had hung his hat, a
  3485	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdeep tarpaulin, watertight, with a broad brim. Peter put the eggs into
  3486	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthis hat and set it on the lagoon. It floated beautifully.
  3487	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3488	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe Never bird saw at once what he was up to, and screamed her
  3489	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tadmiration of him; and, alas, Peter crowed his agreement with her. Then
  3490	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\the got into the nest, reared the stave in it as a mast, and hung up his
  3491	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tshirt for a sail. At the same moment the bird fluttered down upon the
  3492	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\that and once more sat snugly on her eggs. She drifted in one direction,
  3493	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand he was borne off in another, both cheering.
  3494	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3495	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tOf course when Peter landed he beached his barque [small ship, actually
  3496	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe Never Bird’s nest in this particular case in point] in a place where
  3497	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe bird would easily find it; but the hat was such a great success that
  3498	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tshe abandoned the nest. It drifted about till it went to pieces, and
  3499	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\toften Starkey came to the shore of the lagoon, and with many bitter
  3500	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfeelings watched the bird sitting on his hat. As we shall not see her
  3501	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tagain, it may be worth mentioning here that all Never birds now build
  3502	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tin that shape of nest, with a broad brim on which the youngsters take an
  3503	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tairing.
  3504	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3505	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tGreat were the rejoicings when Peter reached the home under the ground
  3506	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\talmost as soon as Wendy, who had been carried hither and thither by
  3507	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe kite. Every boy had adventures to tell; but perhaps the biggest
  3508	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tadventure of all was that they were several hours late for bed. This so
  3509	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tinflated them that they did various dodgy things to get staying up still
  3510	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlonger, such as demanding bandages; but Wendy, though glorying in having
  3511	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthem all home again safe and sound, was scandalised by the lateness of
  3512	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe hour, and cried, “To bed, to bed,” in a voice that had to be obeyed.
  3513	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNext day, however, she was awfully tender, and gave out bandages to
  3514	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tevery one, and they played till bed-time at limping about and carrying
  3515	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttheir arms in slings.

  3520	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tChapter 10 THE HAPPY HOME
  3521	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3522	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tOne important result of the brush [with the pirates] on the lagoon was
  3523	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthat it made the redskins their friends. Peter had saved Tiger Lily from
  3524	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ta dreadful fate, and now there was nothing she and her braves would not
  3525	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdo for him. All night they sat above, keeping watch over the home under
  3526	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe ground and awaiting the big attack by the pirates which obviously
  3527	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcould not be much longer delayed. Even by day they hung about, smoking
  3528	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe pipe of peace, and looking almost as if they wanted tit-bits to eat.
  3529	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3530	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThey called Peter the Great White Father, prostrating themselves [lying
  3531	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdown] before him; and he liked this tremendously, so that it was not
  3532	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\treally good for him.
  3533	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3534	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“The great white father,” he would say to them in a very lordly manner,
  3535	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tas they grovelled at his feet, “is glad to see the Piccaninny warriors
  3536	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tprotecting his wigwam from the pirates.”
  3537	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3538	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Me Tiger Lily,” that lovely creature would reply. “Peter Pan save me,
  3539	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tme his velly nice friend. Me no let pirates hurt him.”
  3540	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3541	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tShe was far too pretty to cringe in this way, but Peter thought it his
  3542	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdue, and he would answer condescendingly, “It is good. Peter Pan has
  3543	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tspoken.”
  3544	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3545	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAlways when he said, “Peter Pan has spoken,” it meant that they must now
  3546	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tshut up, and they accepted it humbly in that spirit; but they were by
  3547	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tno means so respectful to the other boys, whom they looked upon as just
  3548	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tordinary braves. They said “How-do?” to them, and things like that; and
  3549	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twhat annoyed the boys was that Peter seemed to think this all right.
  3550	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3551	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tSecretly Wendy sympathised with them a little, but she was far too loyal
  3552	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ta housewife to listen to any complaints against father. “Father knows
  3553	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbest,” she always said, whatever her private opinion must be. Her
  3554	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tprivate opinion was that the redskins should not call her a squaw.
  3555	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3556	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWe have now reached the evening that was to be known among them as the
  3557	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNight of Nights, because of its adventures and their upshot. The day, as
  3558	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tif quietly gathering its forces, had been almost uneventful, and now the
  3559	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tredskins in their blankets were at their posts above, while, below, the
  3560	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tchildren were having their evening meal; all except Peter, who had gone
  3561	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tout to get the time. The way you got the time on the island was to find
  3562	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe crocodile, and then stay near him till the clock struck.
  3563	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3564	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe meal happened to be a make-believe tea, and they sat around the
  3565	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tboard, guzzling in their greed; and really, what with their chatter and
  3566	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\trecriminations, the noise, as Wendy said, was positively deafening.
  3567	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tTo be sure, she did not mind noise, but she simply would not have them
  3568	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tgrabbing things, and then excusing themselves by saying that Tootles had
  3569	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tpushed their elbow. There was a fixed rule that they must never hit back
  3570	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tat meals, but should refer the matter of dispute to Wendy by raising
  3571	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe right arm politely and saying, “I complain of so-and-so;” but what
  3572	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tusually happened was that they forgot to do this or did it too much.
  3573	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3574	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Silence,” cried Wendy when for the twentieth time she had told them
  3575	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthat they were not all to speak at once. “Is your mug empty, Slightly
  3576	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdarling?”
  3577	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3578	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Not quite empty, mummy,” Slightly said, after looking into an imaginary
  3579	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmug.
  3580	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3581	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“He hasn’t even begun to drink his milk,” Nibs interposed.
  3582	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3583	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThis was telling, and Slightly seized his chance.
  3584	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3585	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I complain of Nibs,” he cried promptly.
  3586	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3587	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tJohn, however, had held up his hand first.
  3588	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3589	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Well, John?”
  3590	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3591	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“May I sit in Peter’s chair, as he is not here?”
  3592	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3593	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Sit in father’s chair, John!” Wendy was scandalised. “Certainly not.”
  3594	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3595	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“He is not really our father,” John answered. “He didn’t even know how a
  3596	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfather does till I showed him.”
  3597	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3598	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThis was grumbling. “We complain of John,” cried the twins.
  3599	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3600	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tTootles held up his hand. He was so much the humblest of them, indeed he
  3601	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twas the only humble one, that Wendy was specially gentle with him.
  3602	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3603	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I don’t suppose,” Tootles said diffidently [bashfully or timidly],
  3604	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“that I could be father.”
  3605	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3606	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“No, Tootles.”
  3607	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3608	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tOnce Tootles began, which was not very often, he had a silly way of
  3609	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tgoing on.
  3610	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3611	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“As I can’t be father,” he said heavily, “I don’t suppose, Michael, you
  3612	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twould let me be baby?”
  3613	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3614	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“No, I won’t,” Michael rapped out. He was already in his basket.
  3615	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3616	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“As I can’t be baby,” Tootles said, getting heavier and heavier and
  3617	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\theavier, “do you think I could be a twin?”
  3618	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3619	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“No, indeed,” replied the twins; “it’s awfully difficult to be a twin.”
  3620	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3621	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“As I can’t be anything important,” said Tootles, “would any of you like
  3622	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tto see me do a trick?”
  3623	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3624	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“No,” they all replied.
  3625	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3626	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThen at last he stopped. “I hadn’t really any hope,” he said.
  3627	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3628	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe hateful telling broke out again.
  3629	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3630	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Slightly is coughing on the table.”
  3631	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3632	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“The twins began with cheese-cakes.”
  3633	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3634	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Curly is taking both butter and honey.”
  3635	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3636	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Nibs is speaking with his mouth full.”
  3637	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3638	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I complain of the twins.”
  3639	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3640	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I complain of Curly.”
  3641	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3642	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I complain of Nibs.”
  3643	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3644	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Oh dear, oh dear,” cried Wendy, “I’m sure I sometimes think that
  3645	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tspinsters are to be envied.”
  3646	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3647	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tShe told them to clear away, and sat down to her work-basket, a heavy
  3648	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tload of stockings and every knee with a hole in it as usual.
  3649	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3650	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Wendy,” remonstrated [scolded] Michael, “I’m too big for a cradle.”
  3651	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3652	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I must have somebody in a cradle,” she said almost tartly, “and you
  3653	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tare the littlest. A cradle is such a nice homely thing to have about a
  3654	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thouse.”
  3655	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3656	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWhile she sewed they played around her; such a group of happy faces
  3657	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand dancing limbs lit up by that romantic fire. It had become a very
  3658	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfamiliar scene, this, in the home under the ground, but we are looking
  3659	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ton it for the last time.
  3660	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3661	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThere was a step above, and Wendy, you may be sure, was the first to
  3662	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\trecognize it.
  3663	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3664	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Children, I hear your father’s step. He likes you to meet him at the
  3665	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdoor.”
  3666	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3667	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAbove, the redskins crouched before Peter.
  3668	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3669	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Watch well, braves. I have spoken.”
  3670	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3671	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAnd then, as so often before, the gay children dragged him from his
  3672	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttree. As so often before, but never again.
  3673	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3674	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe had brought nuts for the boys as well as the correct time for Wendy.
  3675	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3676	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Peter, you just spoil them, you know,” Wendy simpered [exaggerated a
  3677	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsmile].
  3678	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3679	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Ah, old lady,” said Peter, hanging up his gun.
  3680	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3681	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“It was me told him mothers are called old lady,” Michael whispered to
  3682	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tCurly.
  3683	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3684	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I complain of Michael,” said Curly instantly.
  3685	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3686	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe first twin came to Peter. “Father, we want to dance.”
  3687	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3688	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Dance away, my little man,” said Peter, who was in high good humour.
  3689	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3690	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“But we want you to dance.”
  3691	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3692	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPeter was really the best dancer among them, but he pretended to be
  3693	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tscandalised.
  3694	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3695	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Me! My old bones would rattle!”
  3696	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3697	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“And mummy too.”
  3698	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3699	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“What,” cried Wendy, “the mother of such an armful, dance!”
  3700	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3701	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“But on a Saturday night,” Slightly insinuated.
  3702	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3703	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIt was not really Saturday night, at least it may have been, for
  3704	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthey had long lost count of the days; but always if they wanted to do
  3705	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tanything special they said this was Saturday night, and then they did
  3706	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tit.
  3707	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3708	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Of course it is Saturday night, Peter,” Wendy said, relenting.
  3709	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3710	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“People of our figure, Wendy!”
  3711	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3712	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“But it is only among our own progeny [children].”
  3713	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3714	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“True, true.”
  3715	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3716	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tSo they were told they could dance, but they must put on their nighties
  3717	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfirst.
  3718	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3719	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Ah, old lady,” Peter said aside to Wendy, warming himself by the fire
  3720	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand looking down at her as she sat turning a heel, “there is nothing
  3721	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmore pleasant of an evening for you and me when the day’s toil is over
  3722	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthan to rest by the fire with the little ones near by.”
  3723	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3724	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“It is sweet, Peter, isn’t it?” Wendy said, frightfully gratified.
  3725	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Peter, I think Curly has your nose.”
  3726	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3727	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Michael takes after you.”
  3728	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3729	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tShe went to him and put her hand on his shoulder.
  3730	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3731	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Dear Peter,” she said, “with such a large family, of course, I have now
  3732	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tpassed my best, but you don’t want to [ex]change me, do you?”
  3733	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3734	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“No, Wendy.”
  3735	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3736	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tCertainly he did not want a change, but he looked at her uncomfortably,
  3737	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tblinking, you know, like one not sure whether he was awake or asleep.
  3738	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3739	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Peter, what is it?”
  3740	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3741	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I was just thinking,” he said, a little scared. “It is only
  3742	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmake-believe, isn’t it, that I am their father?”
  3743	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3744	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Oh yes,” Wendy said primly [formally and properly].
  3745	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3746	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“You see,” he continued apologetically, “it would make me seem so old to
  3747	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbe their real father.”
  3748	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3749	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“But they are ours, Peter, yours and mine.”
  3750	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3751	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“But not really, Wendy?” he asked anxiously.
  3752	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3753	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Not if you don’t wish it,” she replied; and she distinctly heard his
  3754	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsigh of relief. “Peter,” she asked, trying to speak firmly, “what are
  3755	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tyour exact feelings to [about] me?”
  3756	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3757	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Those of a devoted son, Wendy.”
  3758	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3759	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I thought so,” she said, and went and sat by herself at the extreme end
  3760	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tof the room.
  3761	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3762	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“You are so queer,” he said, frankly puzzled, “and Tiger Lily is just
  3763	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe same. There is something she wants to be to me, but she says it is
  3764	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnot my mother.”
  3765	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3766	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“No, indeed, it is not,” Wendy replied with frightful emphasis. Now we
  3767	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tknow why she was prejudiced against the redskins.
  3768	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3769	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Then what is it?”
  3770	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3771	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“It isn’t for a lady to tell.”
  3772	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3773	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Oh, very well,” Peter said, a little nettled. “Perhaps Tinker Bell will
  3774	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttell me.”
  3775	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3776	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Oh yes, Tinker Bell will tell you,” Wendy retorted scornfully. “She is
  3777	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tan abandoned little creature.”
  3778	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3779	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHere Tink, who was in her bedroom, eavesdropping, squeaked out something
  3780	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\timpudent.
  3781	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3782	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“She says she glories in being abandoned,” Peter interpreted.
  3783	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3784	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe had a sudden idea. “Perhaps Tink wants to be my mother?”
  3785	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3786	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“You silly ass!” cried Tinker Bell in a passion.
  3787	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3788	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tShe had said it so often that Wendy needed no translation.
  3789	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3790	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I almost agree with her,” Wendy snapped. Fancy Wendy snapping! But she
  3791	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thad been much tried, and she little knew what was to happen before the
  3792	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnight was out. If she had known she would not have snapped.
  3793	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3794	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNone of them knew. Perhaps it was best not to know. Their ignorance
  3795	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tgave them one more glad hour; and as it was to be their last hour on the
  3796	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tisland, let us rejoice that there were sixty glad minutes in it. They
  3797	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsang and danced in their night-gowns. Such a deliciously creepy song
  3798	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tit was, in which they pretended to be frightened at their own shadows,
  3799	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlittle witting that so soon shadows would close in upon them, from whom
  3800	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthey would shrink in real fear. So uproariously gay was the dance, and
  3801	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thow they buffeted each other on the bed and out of it! It was a pillow
  3802	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfight rather than a dance, and when it was finished, the pillows
  3803	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tinsisted on one bout more, like partners who know that they may never
  3804	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmeet again. The stories they told, before it was time for Wendy’s
  3805	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tgood-night story! Even Slightly tried to tell a story that night, but
  3806	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe beginning was so fearfully dull that it appalled not only the others
  3807	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbut himself, and he said happily:
  3808	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3809	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Yes, it is a dull beginning. I say, let us pretend that it is the end.”
  3810	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3811	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAnd then at last they all got into bed for Wendy’s story, the story they
  3812	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tloved best, the story Peter hated. Usually when she began to tell this
  3813	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tstory he left the room or put his hands over his ears; and possibly if
  3814	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\the had done either of those things this time they might all still be on
  3815	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe island. But to-night he remained on his stool; and we shall see what
  3816	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thappened.
  3817	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3818	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3819	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3820	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3821	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tChapter 11 WENDY’S STORY
  3822	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3823	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Listen, then,” said Wendy, settling down to her story, with Michael at
  3824	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ther feet and seven boys in the bed. “There was once a gentleman--”
  3825	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3826	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I had rather he had been a lady,” Curly said.
  3827	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3828	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I wish he had been a white rat,” said Nibs.
  3829	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3830	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Quiet,” their mother admonished [cautioned] them. “There was a lady
  3831	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\talso, and--”
  3832	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3833	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Oh, mummy,” cried the first twin, “you mean that there is a lady also,
  3834	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdon’t you? She is not dead, is she?”
  3835	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3836	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Oh, no.”
  3837	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3838	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I am awfully glad she isn’t dead,” said Tootles. “Are you glad, John?”
  3839	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3840	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Of course I am.”
  3841	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3842	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Are you glad, Nibs?”
  3843	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3844	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Rather.”
  3845	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3846	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Are you glad, Twins?”
  3847	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3848	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“We are glad.”
  3849	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3850	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Oh dear,” sighed Wendy.
  3851	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3852	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Little less noise there,” Peter called out, determined that she should
  3853	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thave fair play, however beastly a story it might be in his opinion.
  3854	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3855	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“The gentleman’s name,” Wendy continued, “was Mr. Darling, and her name
  3856	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twas Mrs. Darling.”
  3857	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3858	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I knew them,” John said, to annoy the others.
  3859	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3860	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I think I knew them,” said Michael rather doubtfully.
  3861	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3862	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“They were married, you know,” explained Wendy, “and what do you think
  3863	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthey had?”
  3864	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3865	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“White rats,” cried Nibs, inspired.
  3866	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3867	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“No.”
  3868	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3869	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“It’s awfully puzzling,” said Tootles, who knew the story by heart.
  3870	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3871	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Quiet, Tootles. They had three descendants.”
  3872	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3873	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“What is descendants?”
  3874	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3875	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Well, you are one, Twin.”
  3876	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3877	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Did you hear that, John? I am a descendant.”
  3878	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3879	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Descendants are only children,” said John.
  3880	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3881	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Oh dear, oh dear,” sighed Wendy. “Now these three children had a
  3882	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfaithful nurse called Nana; but Mr. Darling was angry with her and
  3883	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tchained her up in the yard, and so all the children flew away.”
  3884	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3885	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“It’s an awfully good story,” said Nibs.
  3886	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3887	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“They flew away,” Wendy continued, “to the Neverland, where the lost
  3888	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tchildren are.”
  3889	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3890	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I just thought they did,” Curly broke in excitedly. “I don’t know how
  3891	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tit is, but I just thought they did!”
  3892	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3893	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“O Wendy,” cried Tootles, “was one of the lost children called Tootles?”
  3894	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3895	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Yes, he was.”
  3896	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3897	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I am in a story. Hurrah, I am in a story, Nibs.”
  3898	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3899	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Hush. Now I want you to consider the feelings of the unhappy parents
  3900	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twith all their children flown away.”
  3901	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3902	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Oo!” they all moaned, though they were not really considering the
  3903	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfeelings of the unhappy parents one jot.
  3904	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3905	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Think of the empty beds!”
  3906	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3907	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Oo!”
  3908	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3909	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“It’s awfully sad,” the first twin said cheerfully.
  3910	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3911	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I don’t see how it can have a happy ending,” said the second twin. “Do
  3912	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tyou, Nibs?”
  3913	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3914	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I’m frightfully anxious.”
  3915	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3916	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“If you knew how great is a mother’s love,” Wendy told them
  3917	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttriumphantly, “you would have no fear.” She had now come to the part
  3918	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthat Peter hated.
  3919	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3920	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I do like a mother’s love,” said Tootles, hitting Nibs with a pillow.
  3921	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Do you like a mother’s love, Nibs?”
  3922	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3923	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I do just,” said Nibs, hitting back.
  3924	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3925	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“You see,” Wendy said complacently, “our heroine knew that the mother
  3926	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twould always leave the window open for her children to fly back by; so
  3927	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthey stayed away for years and had a lovely time.”
  3928	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3929	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Did they ever go back?”
  3930	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3931	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Let us now,” said Wendy, bracing herself up for her finest effort,
  3932	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“take a peep into the future;” and they all gave themselves the twist
  3933	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthat makes peeps into the future easier. “Years have rolled by, and who
  3934	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tis this elegant lady of uncertain age alighting at London Station?”
  3935	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3936	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“O Wendy, who is she?” cried Nibs, every bit as excited as if he didn’t
  3937	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tknow.
  3938	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3939	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Can it be--yes--no--it is--the fair Wendy!”
  3940	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3941	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Oh!”
  3942	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3943	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“And who are the two noble portly figures accompanying her, now grown to
  3944	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tman’s estate? Can they be John and Michael? They are!”
  3945	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3946	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Oh!”
  3947	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3948	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“‘See, dear brothers,’ says Wendy pointing upwards, ‘there is the window
  3949	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tstill standing open. Ah, now we are rewarded for our sublime faith in a
  3950	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmother’s love.’ So up they flew to their mummy and daddy, and pen cannot
  3951	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdescribe the happy scene, over which we draw a veil.”
  3952	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3953	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThat was the story, and they were as pleased with it as the fair
  3954	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnarrator herself. Everything just as it should be, you see. Off we skip
  3955	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlike the most heartless things in the world, which is what children are,
  3956	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbut so attractive; and we have an entirely selfish time, and then when
  3957	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twe have need of special attention we nobly return for it, confident that
  3958	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twe shall be rewarded instead of smacked.
  3959	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3960	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tSo great indeed was their faith in a mother’s love that they felt they
  3961	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcould afford to be callous for a bit longer.
  3962	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3963	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tBut there was one there who knew better, and when Wendy finished he
  3964	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tuttered a hollow groan.
  3965	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3966	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“What is it, Peter?” she cried, running to him, thinking he was ill. She
  3967	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfelt him solicitously, lower down than his chest. “Where is it, Peter?”
  3968	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3969	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“It isn’t that kind of pain,” Peter replied darkly.
  3970	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3971	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Then what kind is it?”
  3972	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3973	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Wendy, you are wrong about mothers.”
  3974	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3975	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThey all gathered round him in affright, so alarming was his agitation;
  3976	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand with a fine candour he told them what he had hitherto concealed.
  3977	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3978	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Long ago,” he said, “I thought like you that my mother would always
  3979	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tkeep the window open for me, so I stayed away for moons and moons and
  3980	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmoons, and then flew back; but the window was barred, for mother had
  3981	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tforgotten all about me, and there was another little boy sleeping in my
  3982	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbed.”
  3983	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3984	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tI am not sure that this was true, but Peter thought it was true; and it
  3985	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tscared them.
  3986	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3987	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Are you sure mothers are like that?”
  3988	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3989	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Yes.”
  3990	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3991	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tSo this was the truth about mothers. The toads!
  3992	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3993	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tStill it is best to be careful; and no one knows so quickly as a child
  3994	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twhen he should give in. “Wendy, let us [let’s] go home,” cried John and
  3995	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tMichael together.
  3996	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3997	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Yes,” she said, clutching them.
  3998	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  3999	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Not to-night?” asked the lost boys bewildered. They knew in what they
  4000	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcalled their hearts that one can get on quite well without a mother, and
  4001	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthat it is only the mothers who think you can’t.
  4002	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4003	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“At once,” Wendy replied resolutely, for the horrible thought had come
  4004	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tto her: “Perhaps mother is in half mourning by this time.”
  4005	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4006	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThis dread made her forgetful of what must be Peter’s feelings, and
  4007	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tshe said to him rather sharply, “Peter, will you make the necessary
  4008	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tarrangements?”
  4009	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4010	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“If you wish it,” he replied, as coolly as if she had asked him to pass
  4011	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe nuts.
  4012	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4013	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNot so much as a sorry-to-lose-you between them! If she did not mind the
  4014	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tparting, he was going to show her, was Peter, that neither did he.
  4015	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4016	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tBut of course he cared very much; and he was so full of wrath against
  4017	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tgrown-ups, who, as usual, were spoiling everything, that as soon as he
  4018	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tgot inside his tree he breathed intentionally quick short breaths at the
  4019	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\trate of about five to a second. He did this because there is a saying in
  4020	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe Neverland that, every time you breathe, a grown-up dies; and Peter
  4021	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twas killing them off vindictively as fast as possible.
  4022	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4023	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThen having given the necessary instructions to the redskins he returned
  4024	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tto the home, where an unworthy scene had been enacted in his absence.
  4025	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPanic-stricken at the thought of losing Wendy the lost boys had advanced
  4026	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tupon her threateningly.
  4027	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4028	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“It will be worse than before she came,” they cried.
  4029	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4030	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“We shan’t let her go.”
  4031	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4032	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Let’s keep her prisoner.”
  4033	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4034	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Ay, chain her up.”
  4035	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4036	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIn her extremity an instinct told her to which of them to turn.
  4037	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4038	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Tootles,” she cried, “I appeal to you.”
  4039	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4040	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWas it not strange? She appealed to Tootles, quite the silliest one.
  4041	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4042	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tGrandly, however, did Tootles respond. For that one moment he dropped
  4043	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\this silliness and spoke with dignity.
  4044	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4045	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I am just Tootles,” he said, “and nobody minds me. But the first who
  4046	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdoes not behave to Wendy like an English gentleman I will blood him
  4047	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tseverely.”
  4048	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4049	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe drew back his hanger; and for that instant his sun was at noon. The
  4050	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tothers held back uneasily. Then Peter returned, and they saw at once
  4051	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthat they would get no support from him. He would keep no girl in the
  4052	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNeverland against her will.
  4053	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4054	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Wendy,” he said, striding up and down, “I have asked the redskins to
  4055	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tguide you through the wood, as flying tires you so.”
  4056	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4057	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Thank you, Peter.”
  4058	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4059	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Then,” he continued, in the short sharp voice of one accustomed to be
  4060	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tobeyed, “Tinker Bell will take you across the sea. Wake her, Nibs.”
  4061	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4062	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNibs had to knock twice before he got an answer, though Tink had really
  4063	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbeen sitting up in bed listening for some time.
  4064	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4065	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Who are you? How dare you? Go away,” she cried.
  4066	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4067	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“You are to get up, Tink,” Nibs called, “and take Wendy on a journey.”
  4068	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4069	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tOf course Tink had been delighted to hear that Wendy was going; but
  4070	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tshe was jolly well determined not to be her courier, and she said so in
  4071	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tstill more offensive language. Then she pretended to be asleep again.
  4072	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4073	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“She says she won’t!” Nibs exclaimed, aghast at such insubordination,
  4074	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twhereupon Peter went sternly toward the young lady’s chamber.
  4075	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4076	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Tink,” he rapped out, “if you don’t get up and dress at once I will
  4077	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\topen the curtains, and then we shall all see you in your negligee
  4078	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t[nightgown].”
  4079	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4080	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThis made her leap to the floor. “Who said I wasn’t getting up?” she
  4081	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcried.
  4082	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4083	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIn the meantime the boys were gazing very forlornly at Wendy, now
  4084	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tequipped with John and Michael for the journey. By this time they were
  4085	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdejected, not merely because they were about to lose her, but also
  4086	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbecause they felt that she was going off to something nice to which they
  4087	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thad not been invited. Novelty was beckoning to them as usual.
  4088	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4089	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tCrediting them with a nobler feeling Wendy melted.
  4090	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4091	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Dear ones,” she said, “if you will all come with me I feel almost sure
  4092	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tI can get my father and mother to adopt you.”
  4093	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4094	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe invitation was meant specially for Peter, but each of the boys was
  4095	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthinking exclusively of himself, and at once they jumped with joy.
  4096	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4097	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“But won’t they think us rather a handful?” Nibs asked in the middle of
  4098	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\this jump.
  4099	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4100	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Oh no,” said Wendy, rapidly thinking it out, “it will only mean having
  4101	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ta few beds in the drawing-room; they can be hidden behind the screens on
  4102	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfirst Thursdays.”
  4103	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4104	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Peter, can we go?” they all cried imploringly. They took it for granted
  4105	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthat if they went he would go also, but really they scarcely cared. Thus
  4106	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tchildren are ever ready, when novelty knocks, to desert their dearest
  4107	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tones.
  4108	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4109	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“All right,” Peter replied with a bitter smile, and immediately they
  4110	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\trushed to get their things.
  4111	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4112	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“And now, Peter,” Wendy said, thinking she had put everything right,
  4113	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I am going to give you your medicine before you go.” She loved to give
  4114	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthem medicine, and undoubtedly gave them too much. Of course it was only
  4115	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twater, but it was out of a bottle, and she always shook the bottle and
  4116	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcounted the drops, which gave it a certain medicinal quality. On this
  4117	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\toccasion, however, she did not give Peter his draught [portion], for
  4118	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tjust as she had prepared it, she saw a look on his face that made her
  4119	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\theart sink.
  4120	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4121	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Get your things, Peter,” she cried, shaking.
  4122	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4123	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“No,” he answered, pretending indifference, “I am not going with you,
  4124	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWendy.”
  4125	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4126	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Yes, Peter.”
  4127	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4128	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“No.”
  4129	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4130	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tTo show that her departure would leave him unmoved, he skipped up and
  4131	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdown the room, playing gaily on his heartless pipes. She had to run
  4132	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tabout after him, though it was rather undignified.
  4133	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4134	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“To find your mother,” she coaxed.
  4135	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4136	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNow, if Peter had ever quite had a mother, he no longer missed her. He
  4137	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcould do very well without one. He had thought them out, and remembered
  4138	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tonly their bad points.
  4139	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4140	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“No, no,” he told Wendy decisively; “perhaps she would say I was old,
  4141	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand I just want always to be a little boy and to have fun.”
  4142	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4143	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“But, Peter--”
  4144	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4145	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“No.”
  4146	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4147	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAnd so the others had to be told.
  4148	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4149	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Peter isn’t coming.”
  4150	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4151	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPeter not coming! They gazed blankly at him, their sticks over their
  4152	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbacks, and on each stick a bundle. Their first thought was that if Peter
  4153	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twas not going he had probably changed his mind about letting them go.
  4154	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4155	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tBut he was far too proud for that. “If you find your mothers,” he said
  4156	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdarkly, “I hope you will like them.”
  4157	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4158	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe awful cynicism of this made an uncomfortable impression, and most
  4159	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tof them began to look rather doubtful. After all, their faces said, were
  4160	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthey not noodles to want to go?
  4161	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4162	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Now then,” cried Peter, “no fuss, no blubbering; good-bye, Wendy;” and
  4163	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\the held out his hand cheerily, quite as if they must really go now, for
  4164	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\the had something important to do.
  4165	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4166	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tShe had to take his hand, and there was no indication that he would
  4167	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tprefer a thimble.
  4168	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4169	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“You will remember about changing your flannels, Peter?” she said,
  4170	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlingering over him. She was always so particular about their flannels.
  4171	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4172	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Yes.”
  4173	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4174	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“And you will take your medicine?”
  4175	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4176	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Yes.”
  4177	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4178	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThat seemed to be everything, and an awkward pause followed. Peter,
  4179	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thowever, was not the kind that breaks down before other people. “Are you
  4180	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tready, Tinker Bell?” he called out.
  4181	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4182	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Ay, ay.”
  4183	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4184	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Then lead the way.”
  4185	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4186	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tTink darted up the nearest tree; but no one followed her, for it was
  4187	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tat this moment that the pirates made their dreadful attack upon the
  4188	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tredskins. Above, where all had been so still, the air was rent with
  4189	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tshrieks and the clash of steel. Below, there was dead silence. Mouths
  4190	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\topened and remained open. Wendy fell on her knees, but her arms were
  4191	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\textended toward Peter. All arms were extended to him, as if suddenly
  4192	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tblown in his direction; they were beseeching him mutely not to desert
  4193	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthem. As for Peter, he seized his sword, the same he thought he had
  4194	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tslain Barbecue with, and the lust of battle was in his eye.

  4199	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tChapter 12 THE CHILDREN ARE CARRIED OFF
  4200	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4201	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe pirate attack had been a complete surprise: a sure proof that the
  4202	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tunscrupulous Hook had conducted it improperly, for to surprise redskins
  4203	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfairly is beyond the wit of the white man.
  4204	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4205	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tBy all the unwritten laws of savage warfare it is always the redskin who
  4206	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tattacks, and with the wiliness of his race he does it just before the
  4207	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdawn, at which time he knows the courage of the whites to be at its
  4208	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlowest ebb. The white men have in the meantime made a rude stockade on
  4209	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe summit of yonder undulating ground, at the foot of which a stream
  4210	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\truns, for it is destruction to be too far from water. There they await
  4211	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe onslaught, the inexperienced ones clutching their revolvers and
  4212	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttreading on twigs, but the old hands sleeping tranquilly until just
  4213	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbefore the dawn. Through the long black night the savage scouts wriggle,
  4214	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsnake-like, among the grass without stirring a blade. The brushwood
  4215	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcloses behind them, as silently as sand into which a mole has dived.
  4216	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNot a sound is to be heard, save when they give vent to a wonderful
  4217	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\timitation of the lonely call of the coyote. The cry is answered by other
  4218	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbraves; and some of them do it even better than the coyotes, who are not
  4219	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tvery good at it. So the chill hours wear on, and the long suspense is
  4220	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thorribly trying to the paleface who has to live through it for the first
  4221	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttime; but to the trained hand those ghastly calls and still ghastlier
  4222	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsilences are but an intimation of how the night is marching.
  4223	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4224	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThat this was the usual procedure was so well known to Hook that in
  4225	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdisregarding it he cannot be excused on the plea of ignorance.
  4226	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4227	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe Piccaninnies, on their part, trusted implicitly to his honour, and
  4228	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttheir whole action of the night stands out in marked contrast to his.
  4229	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThey left nothing undone that was consistent with the reputation of
  4230	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttheir tribe. With that alertness of the senses which is at once the
  4231	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmarvel and despair of civilised peoples, they knew that the pirates were
  4232	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ton the island from the moment one of them trod on a dry stick; and in
  4233	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tan incredibly short space of time the coyote cries began. Every foot of
  4234	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tground between the spot where Hook had landed his forces and the
  4235	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thome under the trees was stealthily examined by braves wearing their
  4236	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmocassins with the heels in front. They found only one hillock with a
  4237	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tstream at its base, so that Hook had no choice; here he must establish
  4238	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thimself and wait for just before the dawn. Everything being thus mapped
  4239	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tout with almost diabolical cunning, the main body of the redskins folded
  4240	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttheir blankets around them, and in the phlegmatic manner that is to
  4241	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthem, the pearl of manhood squatted above the children’s home, awaiting
  4242	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe cold moment when they should deal pale death.
  4243	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4244	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHere dreaming, though wide-awake, of the exquisite tortures to which
  4245	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthey were to put him at break of day, those confiding savages were found
  4246	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tby the treacherous Hook. From the accounts afterwards supplied by such
  4247	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tof the scouts as escaped the carnage, he does not seem even to have
  4248	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tpaused at the rising ground, though it is certain that in that grey
  4249	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlight he must have seen it: no thought of waiting to be attacked appears
  4250	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfrom first to last to have visited his subtle mind; he would not even
  4251	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thold off till the night was nearly spent; on he pounded with no policy
  4252	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbut to fall to [get into combat]. What could the bewildered scouts do,
  4253	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmasters as they were of every war-like artifice save this one, but trot
  4254	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thelplessly after him, exposing themselves fatally to view, while they
  4255	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tgave pathetic utterance to the coyote cry.
  4256	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4257	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAround the brave Tiger Lily were a dozen of her stoutest warriors, and
  4258	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthey suddenly saw the perfidious pirates bearing down upon them. Fell
  4259	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfrom their eyes then the film through which they had looked at
  4260	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tvictory. No more would they torture at the stake. For them the happy
  4261	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thunting-grounds was now. They knew it; but as their father’s sons they
  4262	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tacquitted themselves. Even then they had time to gather in a phalanx
  4263	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t[dense formation] that would have been hard to break had they risen
  4264	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tquickly, but this they were forbidden to do by the traditions of their
  4265	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\trace. It is written that the noble savage must never express surprise in
  4266	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe presence of the white. Thus terrible as the sudden appearance of the
  4267	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tpirates must have been to them, they remained stationary for a moment,
  4268	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnot a muscle moving; as if the foe had come by invitation. Then, indeed,
  4269	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe tradition gallantly upheld, they seized their weapons, and the air
  4270	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twas torn with the war-cry; but it was now too late.
  4271	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4272	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIt is no part of ours to describe what was a massacre rather than a
  4273	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfight. Thus perished many of the flower of the Piccaninny tribe. Not all
  4274	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tunavenged did they die, for with Lean Wolf fell Alf Mason, to disturb
  4275	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe Spanish Main no more, and among others who bit the dust were Geo.
  4276	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tScourie, Chas. Turley, and the Alsatian Foggerty. Turley fell to the
  4277	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttomahawk of the terrible Panther, who ultimately cut a way through the
  4278	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tpirates with Tiger Lily and a small remnant of the tribe.
  4279	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4280	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tTo what extent Hook is to blame for his tactics on this occasion is for
  4281	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe historian to decide. Had he waited on the rising ground till the
  4282	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tproper hour he and his men would probably have been butchered; and in
  4283	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tjudging him it is only fair to take this into account. What he should
  4284	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tperhaps have done was to acquaint his opponents that he proposed to
  4285	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfollow a new method. On the other hand, this, as destroying the element
  4286	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tof surprise, would have made his strategy of no avail, so that the whole
  4287	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tquestion is beset with difficulties. One cannot at least withhold a
  4288	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\treluctant admiration for the wit that had conceived so bold a scheme,
  4289	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand the fell [deadly] genius with which it was carried out.
  4290	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4291	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWhat were his own feelings about himself at that triumphant moment?
  4292	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tFain [gladly] would his dogs have known, as breathing heavily and wiping
  4293	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttheir cutlasses, they gathered at a discreet distance from his hook, and
  4294	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsquinted through their ferret eyes at this extraordinary man. Elation
  4295	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmust have been in his heart, but his face did not reflect it: ever a
  4296	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdark and solitary enigma, he stood aloof from his followers in spirit as
  4297	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tin substance.
  4298	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4299	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe night’s work was not yet over, for it was not the redskins he had
  4300	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcome out to destroy; they were but the bees to be smoked, so that he
  4301	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tshould get at the honey. It was Pan he wanted, Pan and Wendy and their
  4302	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tband, but chiefly Pan.
  4303	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4304	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPeter was such a small boy that one tends to wonder at the man’s hatred
  4305	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tof him. True he had flung Hook’s arm to the crocodile, but even this
  4306	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand the increased insecurity of life to which it led, owing to
  4307	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe crocodile’s pertinacity [persistance], hardly account for a
  4308	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tvindictiveness so relentless and malignant. The truth is that there was
  4309	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ta something about Peter which goaded the pirate captain to frenzy. It
  4310	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twas not his courage, it was not his engaging appearance, it was not--.
  4311	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThere is no beating about the bush, for we know quite well what it was,
  4312	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand have got to tell. It was Peter’s cockiness.
  4313	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4314	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThis had got on Hook’s nerves; it made his iron claw twitch, and at
  4315	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnight it disturbed him like an insect. While Peter lived, the tortured
  4316	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tman felt that he was a lion in a cage into which a sparrow had come.
  4317	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4318	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe question now was how to get down the trees, or how to get his dogs
  4319	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdown? He ran his greedy eyes over them, searching for the thinnest
  4320	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tones. They wriggled uncomfortably, for they knew he would not scruple
  4321	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t[hesitate] to ram them down with poles.
  4322	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4323	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIn the meantime, what of the boys? We have seen them at the first clang
  4324	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tof the weapons, turned as it were into stone figures, open-mouthed,
  4325	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tall appealing with outstretched arms to Peter; and we return to them as
  4326	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttheir mouths close, and their arms fall to their sides. The pandemonium
  4327	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tabove has ceased almost as suddenly as it arose, passed like a fierce
  4328	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tgust of wind; but they know that in the passing it has determined their
  4329	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfate.
  4330	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4331	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWhich side had won?
  4332	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4333	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe pirates, listening avidly at the mouths of the trees, heard the
  4334	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tquestion put by every boy, and alas, they also heard Peter’s answer.
  4335	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4336	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“If the redskins have won,” he said, “they will beat the tom-tom; it is
  4337	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\talways their sign of victory.”
  4338	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4339	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNow Smee had found the tom-tom, and was at that moment sitting on it.
  4340	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“You will never hear the tom-tom again,” he muttered, but inaudibly of
  4341	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcourse, for strict silence had been enjoined [urged]. To his amazement
  4342	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHook signed him to beat the tom-tom, and slowly there came to Smee an
  4343	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tunderstanding of the dreadful wickedness of the order. Never, probably,
  4344	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thad this simple man admired Hook so much.
  4345	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4346	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tTwice Smee beat upon the instrument, and then stopped to listen
  4347	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tgleefully.
  4348	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4349	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“The tom-tom,” the miscreants heard Peter cry; “an Indian victory!”
  4350	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4351	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe doomed children answered with a cheer that was music to the black
  4352	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thearts above, and almost immediately they repeated their good-byes
  4353	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tto Peter. This puzzled the pirates, but all their other feelings were
  4354	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tswallowed by a base delight that the enemy were about to come up the
  4355	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttrees. They smirked at each other and rubbed their hands. Rapidly and
  4356	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsilently Hook gave his orders: one man to each tree, and the others to
  4357	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tarrange themselves in a line two yards apart.
  4358	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4359	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4360	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4361	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4362	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tChapter 13 DO YOU BELIEVE IN FAIRIES?
  4363	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4364	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe more quickly this horror is disposed of the better. The first to
  4365	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\temerge from his tree was Curly. He rose out of it into the arms of
  4366	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tCecco, who flung him to Smee, who flung him to Starkey, who flung him to
  4367	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tBill Jukes, who flung him to Noodler, and so he was tossed from one to
  4368	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tanother till he fell at the feet of the black pirate. All the boys were
  4369	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tplucked from their trees in this ruthless manner; and several of them
  4370	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twere in the air at a time, like bales of goods flung from hand to hand.
  4371	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4372	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tA different treatment was accorded to Wendy, who came last. With
  4373	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tironical politeness Hook raised his hat to her, and, offering her his
  4374	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tarm, escorted her to the spot where the others were being gagged. He
  4375	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdid it with such an air, he was so frightfully DISTINGUE [imposingly
  4376	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdistinguished], that she was too fascinated to cry out. She was only a
  4377	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlittle girl.
  4378	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4379	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPerhaps it is tell-tale to divulge that for a moment Hook entranced her,
  4380	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand we tell on her only because her slip led to strange results. Had she
  4381	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thaughtily unhanded him (and we should have loved to write it of her),
  4382	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tshe would have been hurled through the air like the others, and then
  4383	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHook would probably not have been present at the tying of the children;
  4384	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand had he not been at the tying he would not have discovered Slightly’s
  4385	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsecret, and without the secret he could not presently have made his foul
  4386	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tattempt on Peter’s life.
  4387	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4388	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThey were tied to prevent their flying away, doubled up with their knees
  4389	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tclose to their ears; and for the trussing of them the black pirate had
  4390	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcut a rope into nine equal pieces. All went well until Slightly’s turn
  4391	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcame, when he was found to be like those irritating parcels that use up
  4392	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tall the string in going round and leave no tags [ends] with which to
  4393	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttie a knot. The pirates kicked him in their rage, just as you kick the
  4394	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tparcel (though in fairness you should kick the string); and strange
  4395	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tto say it was Hook who told them to belay their violence. His lip was
  4396	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcurled with malicious triumph. While his dogs were merely sweating
  4397	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbecause every time they tried to pack the unhappy lad tight in one
  4398	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tpart he bulged out in another, Hook’s master mind had gone far beneath
  4399	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tSlightly’s surface, probing not for effects but for causes; and his
  4400	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\texultation showed that he had found them. Slightly, white to the gills,
  4401	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tknew that Hook had surprised [discovered] his secret, which was this,
  4402	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthat no boy so blown out could use a tree wherein an average man need
  4403	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tstick. Poor Slightly, most wretched of all the children now, for he
  4404	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twas in a panic about Peter, bitterly regretted what he had done. Madly
  4405	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\taddicted to the drinking of water when he was hot, he had swelled in
  4406	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tconsequence to his present girth, and instead of reducing himself to fit
  4407	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\this tree he had, unknown to the others, whittled his tree to make it fit
  4408	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thim.
  4409	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4410	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tSufficient of this Hook guessed to persuade him that Peter at last lay
  4411	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tat his mercy, but no word of the dark design that now formed in the
  4412	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsubterranean caverns of his mind crossed his lips; he merely signed
  4413	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthat the captives were to be conveyed to the ship, and that he would be
  4414	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\talone.
  4415	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4416	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHow to convey them? Hunched up in their ropes they might indeed be
  4417	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\trolled down hill like barrels, but most of the way lay through a morass.
  4418	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAgain Hook’s genius surmounted difficulties. He indicated that the
  4419	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlittle house must be used as a conveyance. The children were flung into
  4420	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tit, four stout pirates raised it on their shoulders, the others fell in
  4421	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbehind, and singing the hateful pirate chorus the strange procession
  4422	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tset off through the wood. I don’t know whether any of the children were
  4423	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcrying; if so, the singing drowned the sound; but as the little house
  4424	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdisappeared in the forest, a brave though tiny jet of smoke issued from
  4425	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tits chimney as if defying Hook.
  4426	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4427	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHook saw it, and it did Peter a bad service. It dried up any trickle of
  4428	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tpity for him that may have remained in the pirate’s infuriated breast.
  4429	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4430	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe first thing he did on finding himself alone in the fast falling
  4431	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnight was to tiptoe to Slightly’s tree, and make sure that it provided
  4432	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thim with a passage. Then for long he remained brooding; his hat of ill
  4433	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tomen on the sward, so that any gentle breeze which had arisen might play
  4434	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\trefreshingly through his hair. Dark as were his thoughts his blue eyes
  4435	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twere as soft as the periwinkle. Intently he listened for any sound from
  4436	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe nether world, but all was as silent below as above; the house under
  4437	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe ground seemed to be but one more empty tenement in the void. Was
  4438	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthat boy asleep, or did he stand waiting at the foot of Slightly’s tree,
  4439	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twith his dagger in his hand?
  4440	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4441	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThere was no way of knowing, save by going down. Hook let his cloak slip
  4442	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsoftly to the ground, and then biting his lips till a lewd blood stood
  4443	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ton them, he stepped into the tree. He was a brave man, but for a moment
  4444	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\the had to stop there and wipe his brow, which was dripping like a
  4445	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcandle. Then, silently, he let himself go into the unknown.
  4446	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4447	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe arrived unmolested at the foot of the shaft, and stood still again,
  4448	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbiting at his breath, which had almost left him. As his eyes became
  4449	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\taccustomed to the dim light various objects in the home under the trees
  4450	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttook shape; but the only one on which his greedy gaze rested, long
  4451	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsought for and found at last, was the great bed. On the bed lay Peter
  4452	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfast asleep.
  4453	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4454	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tUnaware of the tragedy being enacted above, Peter had continued, for
  4455	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ta little time after the children left, to play gaily on his pipes: no
  4456	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdoubt rather a forlorn attempt to prove to himself that he did not care.
  4457	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThen he decided not to take his medicine, so as to grieve Wendy. Then he
  4458	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlay down on the bed outside the coverlet, to vex her still more; for she
  4459	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thad always tucked them inside it, because you never know that you may
  4460	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnot grow chilly at the turn of the night. Then he nearly cried; but
  4461	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tit struck him how indignant she would be if he laughed instead; so he
  4462	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlaughed a haughty laugh and fell asleep in the middle of it.
  4463	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4464	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tSometimes, though not often, he had dreams, and they were more painful
  4465	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthan the dreams of other boys. For hours he could not be separated from
  4466	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthese dreams, though he wailed piteously in them. They had to do, I
  4467	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthink, with the riddle of his existence. At such times it had been
  4468	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWendy’s custom to take him out of bed and sit with him on her lap,
  4469	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsoothing him in dear ways of her own invention, and when he grew calmer
  4470	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tto put him back to bed before he quite woke up, so that he should
  4471	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnot know of the indignity to which she had subjected him. But on this
  4472	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\toccasion he had fallen at once into a dreamless sleep. One arm dropped
  4473	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tover the edge of the bed, one leg was arched, and the unfinished part of
  4474	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\this laugh was stranded on his mouth, which was open, showing the little
  4475	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tpearls.
  4476	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4477	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThus defenceless Hook found him. He stood silent at the foot of the tree
  4478	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlooking across the chamber at his enemy. Did no feeling of compassion
  4479	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdisturb his sombre breast? The man was not wholly evil; he loved flowers
  4480	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t(I have been told) and sweet music (he was himself no mean performer on
  4481	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe harpsichord); and, let it be frankly admitted, the idyllic nature of
  4482	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe scene stirred him profoundly. Mastered by his better self he would
  4483	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thave returned reluctantly up the tree, but for one thing.
  4484	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4485	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWhat stayed him was Peter’s impertinent appearance as he slept. The
  4486	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\topen mouth, the drooping arm, the arched knee: they were such a
  4487	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tpersonification of cockiness as, taken together, will never again, one
  4488	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmay hope, be presented to eyes so sensitive to their offensiveness. They
  4489	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsteeled Hook’s heart. If his rage had broken him into a hundred pieces
  4490	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tevery one of them would have disregarded the incident, and leapt at the
  4491	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsleeper.
  4492	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4493	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThough a light from the one lamp shone dimly on the bed, Hook stood in
  4494	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdarkness himself, and at the first stealthy step forward he discovered
  4495	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tan obstacle, the door of Slightly’s tree. It did not entirely fill the
  4496	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\taperture, and he had been looking over it. Feeling for the catch,
  4497	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\the found to his fury that it was low down, beyond his reach. To his
  4498	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdisordered brain it seemed then that the irritating quality in Peter’s
  4499	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tface and figure visibly increased, and he rattled the door and flung
  4500	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thimself against it. Was his enemy to escape him after all?
  4501	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4502	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tBut what was that? The red in his eye had caught sight of Peter’s
  4503	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmedicine standing on a ledge within easy reach. He fathomed what it was
  4504	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tstraightaway, and immediately knew that the sleeper was in his power.
  4505	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4506	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tLest he should be taken alive, Hook always carried about his person a
  4507	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdreadful drug, blended by himself of all the death-dealing rings that
  4508	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thad come into his possession. These he had boiled down into a yellow
  4509	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tliquid quite unknown to science, which was probably the most virulent
  4510	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tpoison in existence.
  4511	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4512	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tFive drops of this he now added to Peter’s cup. His hand shook, but it
  4513	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twas in exultation rather than in shame. As he did it he avoided glancing
  4514	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tat the sleeper, but not lest pity should unnerve him; merely to avoid
  4515	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tspilling. Then one long gloating look he cast upon his victim, and
  4516	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tturning, wormed his way with difficulty up the tree. As he emerged
  4517	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tat the top he looked the very spirit of evil breaking from its hole.
  4518	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tDonning his hat at its most rakish angle, he wound his cloak around him,
  4519	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tholding one end in front as if to conceal his person from the night,
  4520	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tof which it was the blackest part, and muttering strangely to himself,
  4521	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tstole away through the trees.
  4522	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4523	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPeter slept on. The light guttered [burned to edges] and went out,
  4524	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tleaving the tenement in darkness; but still he slept. It must have been
  4525	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnot less than ten o’clock by the crocodile, when he suddenly sat up in
  4526	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\this bed, wakened by he knew not what. It was a soft cautious tapping on
  4527	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe door of his tree.
  4528	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4529	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tSoft and cautious, but in that stillness it was sinister. Peter felt for
  4530	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\this dagger till his hand gripped it. Then he spoke.
  4531	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4532	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Who is that?”
  4533	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4534	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tFor long there was no answer: then again the knock.
  4535	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4536	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Who are you?”
  4537	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4538	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNo answer.
  4539	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4540	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe was thrilled, and he loved being thrilled. In two strides he reached
  4541	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe door. Unlike Slightly’s door, it filled the aperture [opening], so
  4542	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthat he could not see beyond it, nor could the one knocking see him.
  4543	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4544	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I won’t open unless you speak,” Peter cried.
  4545	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4546	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThen at last the visitor spoke, in a lovely bell-like voice.
  4547	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4548	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Let me in, Peter.”
  4549	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4550	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIt was Tink, and quickly he unbarred to her. She flew in excitedly, her
  4551	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tface flushed and her dress stained with mud.
  4552	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4553	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“What is it?”
  4554	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4555	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Oh, you could never guess!” she cried, and offered him three guesses.
  4556	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Out with it!” he shouted, and in one ungrammatical sentence, as long as
  4557	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe ribbons that conjurers [magicians] pull from their mouths, she told
  4558	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tof the capture of Wendy and the boys.
  4559	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4560	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPeter’s heart bobbed up and down as he listened. Wendy bound, and on the
  4561	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tpirate ship; she who loved everything to be just so!
  4562	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4563	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I’ll rescue her!” he cried, leaping at his weapons. As he leapt he
  4564	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthought of something he could do to please her. He could take his
  4565	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmedicine.
  4566	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4567	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHis hand closed on the fatal draught.
  4568	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4569	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“No!” shrieked Tinker Bell, who had heard Hook mutter about his deed as
  4570	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\the sped through the forest.
  4571	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4572	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Why not?”
  4573	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4574	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“It is poisoned.”
  4575	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4576	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Poisoned? Who could have poisoned it?”
  4577	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4578	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Hook.”
  4579	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4580	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Don’t be silly. How could Hook have got down here?”
  4581	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4582	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAlas, Tinker Bell could not explain this, for even she did not know the
  4583	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdark secret of Slightly’s tree. Nevertheless Hook’s words had left no
  4584	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\troom for doubt. The cup was poisoned.
  4585	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4586	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Besides,” said Peter, quite believing himself, “I never fell asleep.”
  4587	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4588	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe raised the cup. No time for words now; time for deeds; and with one
  4589	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tof her lightning movements Tink got between his lips and the draught,
  4590	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand drained it to the dregs.
  4591	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4592	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Why, Tink, how dare you drink my medicine?”
  4593	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4594	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tBut she did not answer. Already she was reeling in the air.
  4595	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4596	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“What is the matter with you?” cried Peter, suddenly afraid.
  4597	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4598	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“It was poisoned, Peter,” she told him softly; “and now I am going to be
  4599	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdead.”
  4600	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4601	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“O Tink, did you drink it to save me?”
  4602	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4603	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Yes.”
  4604	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4605	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“But why, Tink?”
  4606	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4607	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHer wings would scarcely carry her now, but in reply she alighted on his
  4608	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tshoulder and gave his nose a loving bite. She whispered in his ear “You
  4609	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsilly ass,” and then, tottering to her chamber, lay down on the bed.
  4610	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4611	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHis head almost filled the fourth wall of her little room as he knelt
  4612	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnear her in distress. Every moment her light was growing fainter; and
  4613	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\the knew that if it went out she would be no more. She liked his tears so
  4614	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmuch that she put out her beautiful finger and let them run over it.
  4615	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4616	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHer voice was so low that at first he could not make out what she said.
  4617	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThen he made it out. She was saying that she thought she could get well
  4618	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tagain if children believed in fairies.
  4619	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4620	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPeter flung out his arms. There were no children there, and it was night
  4621	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttime; but he addressed all who might be dreaming of the Neverland, and
  4622	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twho were therefore nearer to him than you think: boys and girls in their
  4623	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnighties, and naked papooses in their baskets hung from trees.
  4624	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4625	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Do you believe?” he cried.
  4626	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4627	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tTink sat up in bed almost briskly to listen to her fate.
  4628	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4629	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tShe fancied she heard answers in the affirmative, and then again she
  4630	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twasn’t sure.
  4631	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4632	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“What do you think?” she asked Peter.
  4633	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4634	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“If you believe,” he shouted to them, “clap your hands; don’t let Tink
  4635	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdie.”
  4636	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4637	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tMany clapped.
  4638	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4639	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tSome didn’t.
  4640	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4641	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tA few beasts hissed.
  4642	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4643	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe clapping stopped suddenly; as if countless mothers had rushed to
  4644	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttheir nurseries to see what on earth was happening; but already Tink was
  4645	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsaved. First her voice grew strong, then she popped out of bed, then
  4646	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tshe was flashing through the room more merry and impudent than ever. She
  4647	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnever thought of thanking those who believed, but she would have liked to
  4648	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tget at the ones who had hissed.
  4649	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4650	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“And now to rescue Wendy!”
  4651	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4652	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe moon was riding in a cloudy heaven when Peter rose from his tree,
  4653	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbegirt [belted] with weapons and wearing little else, to set out upon
  4654	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\this perilous quest. It was not such a night as he would have chosen.
  4655	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe had hoped to fly, keeping not far from the ground so that nothing
  4656	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tunwonted should escape his eyes; but in that fitful light to have
  4657	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tflown low would have meant trailing his shadow through the trees, thus
  4658	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdisturbing birds and acquainting a watchful foe that he was astir.
  4659	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4660	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe regretted now that he had given the birds of the island such strange
  4661	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnames that they are very wild and difficult of approach.
  4662	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4663	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThere was no other course but to press forward in redskin fashion, at
  4664	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twhich happily he was an adept [expert]. But in what direction, for he
  4665	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcould not be sure that the children had been taken to the ship? A
  4666	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlight fall of snow had obliterated all footmarks; and a deathly silence
  4667	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tpervaded the island, as if for a space Nature stood still in horror of
  4668	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe recent carnage. He had taught the children something of the forest
  4669	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlore that he had himself learned from Tiger Lily and Tinker Bell,
  4670	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand knew that in their dire hour they were not likely to forget it.
  4671	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tSlightly, if he had an opportunity, would blaze [cut a mark in] the
  4672	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttrees, for instance, Curly would drop seeds, and Wendy would leave her
  4673	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thandkerchief at some important place. The morning was needed to search
  4674	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfor such guidance, and he could not wait. The upper world had called
  4675	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thim, but would give no help.
  4676	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4677	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe crocodile passed him, but not another living thing, not a sound, not
  4678	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ta movement; and yet he knew well that sudden death might be at the next
  4679	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttree, or stalking him from behind.
  4680	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4681	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe swore this terrible oath: “Hook or me this time.”
  4682	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4683	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNow he crawled forward like a snake, and again erect, he darted across
  4684	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ta space on which the moonlight played, one finger on his lip and his
  4685	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdagger at the ready. He was frightfully happy.

  4691	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4692	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tOne green light squinting over Kidd’s Creek, which is near the mouth of
  4693	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe pirate river, marked where the brig, the JOLLY ROGER, lay, low in
  4694	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe water; a rakish-looking [speedy-looking] craft foul to the hull,
  4695	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tevery beam in her detestable, like ground strewn with mangled feathers.
  4696	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tShe was the cannibal of the seas, and scarce needed that watchful eye,
  4697	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfor she floated immune in the horror of her name.
  4698	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4699	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tShe was wrapped in the blanket of night, through which no sound from her
  4700	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcould have reached the shore. There was little sound, and none agreeable
  4701	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsave the whir of the ship’s sewing machine at which Smee sat, ever
  4702	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tindustrious and obliging, the essence of the commonplace, pathetic Smee.
  4703	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tI know not why he was so infinitely pathetic, unless it were because
  4704	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\the was so pathetically unaware of it; but even strong men had to turn
  4705	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thastily from looking at him, and more than once on summer evenings he
  4706	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thad touched the fount of Hook’s tears and made it flow. Of this, as of
  4707	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\talmost everything else, Smee was quite unconscious.
  4708	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4709	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tA few of the pirates leant over the bulwarks, drinking in the miasma
  4710	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t[putrid mist] of the night; others sprawled by barrels over games of
  4711	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdice and cards; and the exhausted four who had carried the little house
  4712	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlay prone on the deck, where even in their sleep they rolled skillfully
  4713	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tto this side or that out of Hook’s reach, lest he should claw them
  4714	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmechanically in passing.
  4715	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4716	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHook trod the deck in thought. O man unfathomable. It was his hour of
  4717	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttriumph. Peter had been removed for ever from his path, and all the
  4718	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tother boys were in the brig, about to walk the plank. It was his
  4719	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tgrimmest deed since the days when he had brought Barbecue to heel; and
  4720	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tknowing as we do how vain a tabernacle is man, could we be surprised
  4721	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thad he now paced the deck unsteadily, bellied out by the winds of his
  4722	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsuccess?
  4723	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4724	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tBut there was no elation in his gait, which kept pace with the action of
  4725	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\this sombre mind. Hook was profoundly dejected.
  4726	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4727	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe was often thus when communing with himself on board ship in the
  4728	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tquietude of the night. It was because he was so terribly alone. This
  4729	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tinscrutable man never felt more alone than when surrounded by his dogs.
  4730	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThey were socially inferior to him.
  4731	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4732	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHook was not his true name. To reveal who he really was would even at
  4733	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthis date set the country in a blaze; but as those who read between the
  4734	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlines must already have guessed, he had been at a famous public school;
  4735	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand its traditions still clung to him like garments, with which indeed
  4736	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthey are largely concerned. Thus it was offensive to him even now to
  4737	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tboard a ship in the same dress in which he grappled [attacked] her, and
  4738	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\the still adhered in his walk to the school’s distinguished slouch. But
  4739	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tabove all he retained the passion for good form.
  4740	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4741	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tGood form! However much he may have degenerated, he still knew that this
  4742	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tis all that really matters.
  4743	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4744	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tFrom far within him he heard a creaking as of rusty portals, and through
  4745	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthem came a stern tap-tap-tap, like hammering in the night when one
  4746	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcannot sleep. “Have you been good form to-day?” was their eternal
  4747	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tquestion.
  4748	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4749	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Fame, fame, that glittering bauble, it is mine,” he cried.
  4750	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4751	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Is it quite good form to be distinguished at anything?” the tap-tap
  4752	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfrom his school replied.
  4753	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4754	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I am the only man whom Barbecue feared,” he urged, “and Flint feared
  4755	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tBarbecue.”
  4756	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4757	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Barbecue, Flint--what house?” came the cutting retort.
  4758	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4759	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tMost disquieting reflection of all, was it not bad form to think about
  4760	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tgood form?
  4761	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4762	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHis vitals were tortured by this problem. It was a claw within him
  4763	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsharper than the iron one; and as it tore him, the perspiration dripped
  4764	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdown his tallow [waxy] countenance and streaked his doublet. Ofttimes he
  4765	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdrew his sleeve across his face, but there was no damming that trickle.
  4766	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4767	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAh, envy not Hook.
  4768	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4769	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThere came to him a presentiment of his early dissolution [death]. It
  4770	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twas as if Peter’s terrible oath had boarded the ship. Hook felt a gloomy
  4771	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdesire to make his dying speech, lest presently there should be no time
  4772	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfor it.
  4773	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4774	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Better for Hook,” he cried, “if he had had less ambition!” It was in
  4775	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\this darkest hours only that he referred to himself in the third person.
  4776	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4777	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“No little children to love me!”
  4778	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4779	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tStrange that he should think of this, which had never troubled him
  4780	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbefore; perhaps the sewing machine brought it to his mind. For long he
  4781	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmuttered to himself, staring at Smee, who was hemming placidly, under
  4782	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe conviction that all children feared him.
  4783	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4784	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tFeared him! Feared Smee! There was not a child on board the brig that
  4785	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnight who did not already love him. He had said horrid things to them
  4786	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand hit them with the palm of his hand, because he could not hit with
  4787	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\this fist, but they had only clung to him the more. Michael had tried on
  4788	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\this spectacles.
  4789	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4790	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tTo tell poor Smee that they thought him lovable! Hook itched to do it,
  4791	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbut it seemed too brutal. Instead, he revolved this mystery in his
  4792	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmind: why do they find Smee lovable? He pursued the problem like the
  4793	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsleuth-hound that he was. If Smee was lovable, what was it that made him
  4794	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tso? A terrible answer suddenly presented itself--“Good form?”
  4795	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4796	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHad the bo’sun good form without knowing it, which is the best form of
  4797	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tall?
  4798	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4799	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe remembered that you have to prove you don’t know you have it before
  4800	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tyou are eligible for Pop [an elite social club at Eton].
  4801	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4802	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWith a cry of rage he raised his iron hand over Smee’s head; but he did
  4803	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnot tear. What arrested him was this reflection:
  4804	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4805	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“To claw a man because he is good form, what would that be?”
  4806	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4807	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Bad form!”
  4808	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4809	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe unhappy Hook was as impotent [powerless] as he was damp, and he fell
  4810	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tforward like a cut flower.
  4811	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4812	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHis dogs thinking him out of the way for a time, discipline instantly
  4813	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\trelaxed; and they broke into a bacchanalian [drunken] dance, which
  4814	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbrought him to his feet at once, all traces of human weakness gone, as
  4815	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tif a bucket of water had passed over him.
  4816	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4817	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Quiet, you scugs,” he cried, “or I’ll cast anchor in you;” and at once
  4818	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe din was hushed. “Are all the children chained, so that they cannot
  4819	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfly away?”
  4820	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4821	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Ay, ay.”
  4822	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4823	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Then hoist them up.”
  4824	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4825	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe wretched prisoners were dragged from the hold, all except Wendy,
  4826	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand ranged in line in front of him. For a time he seemed unconscious
  4827	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tof their presence. He lolled at his ease, humming, not unmelodiously,
  4828	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsnatches of a rude song, and fingering a pack of cards. Ever and anon
  4829	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe light from his cigar gave a touch of colour to his face.
  4830	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4831	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Now then, bullies,” he said briskly, “six of you walk the plank
  4832	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tto-night, but I have room for two cabin boys. Which of you is it to be?”
  4833	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4834	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Don’t irritate him unnecessarily,” had been Wendy’s instructions in
  4835	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe hold; so Tootles stepped forward politely. Tootles hated the idea
  4836	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tof signing under such a man, but an instinct told him that it would
  4837	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbe prudent to lay the responsibility on an absent person; and though a
  4838	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsomewhat silly boy, he knew that mothers alone are always willing to be
  4839	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe buffer. All children know this about mothers, and despise them for
  4840	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tit, but make constant use of it.
  4841	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4842	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tSo Tootles explained prudently, “You see, sir, I don’t think my mother
  4843	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twould like me to be a pirate. Would your mother like you to be a pirate,
  4844	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tSlightly?”
  4845	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4846	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe winked at Slightly, who said mournfully, “I don’t think so,” as if
  4847	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\the wished things had been otherwise. “Would your mother like you to be a
  4848	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tpirate, Twin?”
  4849	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4850	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I don’t think so,” said the first twin, as clever as the others. “Nibs,
  4851	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twould--”
  4852	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4853	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Stow this gab,” roared Hook, and the spokesmen were dragged back. “You,
  4854	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tboy,” he said, addressing John, “you look as if you had a little pluck
  4855	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tin you. Didst never want to be a pirate, my hearty?”
  4856	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4857	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNow John had sometimes experienced this hankering at maths. prep.; and
  4858	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\the was struck by Hook’s picking him out.
  4859	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4860	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I once thought of calling myself Red-handed Jack,” he said diffidently.
  4861	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4862	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“And a good name too. We’ll call you that here, bully, if you join.”
  4863	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4864	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“What do you think, Michael?” asked John.
  4865	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4866	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“What would you call me if I join?” Michael demanded.
  4867	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4868	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Blackbeard Joe.”
  4869	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4870	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tMichael was naturally impressed. “What do you think, John?” He wanted
  4871	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tJohn to decide, and John wanted him to decide.
  4872	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4873	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Shall we still be respectful subjects of the King?” John inquired.
  4874	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4875	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThrough Hook’s teeth came the answer: “You would have to swear, ‘Down
  4876	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twith the King.’”
  4877	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4878	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPerhaps John had not behaved very well so far, but he shone out now.
  4879	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4880	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Then I refuse,” he cried, banging the barrel in front of Hook.
  4881	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4882	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“And I refuse,” cried Michael.
  4883	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4884	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Rule Britannia!” squeaked Curly.
  4885	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4886	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe infuriated pirates buffeted them in the mouth; and Hook roared out,
  4887	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“That seals your doom. Bring up their mother. Get the plank ready.”
  4888	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4889	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThey were only boys, and they went white as they saw Jukes and Cecco
  4890	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tpreparing the fatal plank. But they tried to look brave when Wendy was
  4891	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbrought up.
  4892	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4893	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNo words of mine can tell you how Wendy despised those pirates. To the
  4894	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tboys there was at least some glamour in the pirate calling; but all that
  4895	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tshe saw was that the ship had not been tidied for years. There was not
  4896	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ta porthole on the grimy glass of which you might not have written with
  4897	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tyour finger “Dirty pig”; and she had already written it on several. But
  4898	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tas the boys gathered round her she had no thought, of course, save for
  4899	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthem.
  4900	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4901	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“So, my beauty,” said Hook, as if he spoke in syrup, “you are to see
  4902	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tyour children walk the plank.”
  4903	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4904	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tFine gentlemen though he was, the intensity of his communings had soiled
  4905	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\this ruff, and suddenly he knew that she was gazing at it. With a hasty
  4906	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tgesture he tried to hide it, but he was too late.
  4907	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4908	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Are they to die?” asked Wendy, with a look of such frightful contempt
  4909	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthat he nearly fainted.
  4910	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4911	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“They are,” he snarled. “Silence all,” he called gloatingly, “for a
  4912	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmother’s last words to her children.”
  4913	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4914	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAt this moment Wendy was grand. “These are my last words, dear boys,”
  4915	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t she said firmly. “I feel that I have a message to you from your real
  4916	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmothers, and it is this: ‘We hope our sons will die like English
  4917	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tgentlemen.’”
  4918	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4919	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tEven the pirates were awed, and Tootles cried out hysterically, “I am
  4920	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tgoing to do what my mother hopes. What are you to do, Nibs?”
  4921	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4922	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“What my mother hopes. What are you to do, Twin?”
  4923	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4924	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“What my mother hopes. John, what are--”
  4925	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4926	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tBut Hook had found his voice again.
  4927	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4928	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Tie her up!” he shouted.
  4929	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4930	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIt was Smee who tied her to the mast. “See here, honey,” he whispered,
  4931	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I’ll save you if you promise to be my mother.”
  4932	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4933	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tBut not even for Smee would she make such a promise. “I would almost
  4934	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\trather have no children at all,” she said disdainfully [scornfully].
  4935	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4936	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIt is sad to know that not a boy was looking at her as Smee tied her to
  4937	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe mast; the eyes of all were on the plank: that last little walk they
  4938	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twere about to take. They were no longer able to hope that they would
  4939	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twalk it manfully, for the capacity to think had gone from them; they
  4940	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcould stare and shiver only.
  4941	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4942	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHook smiled on them with his teeth closed, and took a step toward Wendy.
  4943	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHis intention was to turn her face so that she should see the boys
  4944	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twalking the plank one by one. But he never reached her, he never heard
  4945	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe cry of anguish he hoped to wring from her. He heard something else
  4946	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tinstead.
  4947	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4948	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIt was the terrible tick-tick of the crocodile.
  4949	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4950	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThey all heard it--pirates, boys, Wendy; and immediately every head was
  4951	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tblown in one direction; not to the water whence the sound proceeded, but
  4952	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttoward Hook. All knew that what was about to happen concerned him alone,
  4953	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand that from being actors they were suddenly become spectators.
  4954	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4955	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tVery frightful was it to see the change that came over him. It was as if
  4956	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\the had been clipped at every joint. He fell in a little heap.
  4957	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4958	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe sound came steadily nearer; and in advance of it came this ghastly
  4959	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthought, “The crocodile is about to board the ship!”
  4960	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4961	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tEven the iron claw hung inactive; as if knowing that it was no intrinsic
  4962	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tpart of what the attacking force wanted. Left so fearfully alone, any
  4963	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tother man would have lain with his eyes shut where he fell: but the
  4964	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tgigantic brain of Hook was still working, and under its guidance he
  4965	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcrawled on the knees along the deck as far from the sound as he could
  4966	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tgo. The pirates respectfully cleared a passage for him, and it was only
  4967	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twhen he brought up against the bulwarks that he spoke.
  4968	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4969	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Hide me!” he cried hoarsely.
  4970	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4971	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThey gathered round him, all eyes averted from the thing that was coming
  4972	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\taboard. They had no thought of fighting it. It was Fate.
  4973	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4974	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tOnly when Hook was hidden from them did curiosity loosen the limbs of
  4975	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe boys so that they could rush to the ship’s side to see the crocodile
  4976	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tclimbing it. Then they got the strangest surprise of the Night of
  4977	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNights; for it was no crocodile that was coming to their aid. It was
  4978	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPeter.
  4979	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4980	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe signed to them not to give vent to any cry of admiration that might
  4981	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\trouse suspicion. Then he went on ticking.
  4982	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4983	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t

  4985	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4986	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tChapter 15 “HOOK OR ME THIS TIME”
  4987	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4988	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tOdd things happen to all of us on our way through life without our
  4989	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnoticing for a time that they have happened. Thus, to take an instance,
  4990	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twe suddenly discover that we have been deaf in one ear for we don’t know
  4991	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thow long, but, say, half an hour. Now such an experience had come that
  4992	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnight to Peter. When last we saw him he was stealing across the island
  4993	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twith one finger to his lips and his dagger at the ready. He had seen the
  4994	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcrocodile pass by without noticing anything peculiar about it, but by
  4995	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand by he remembered that it had not been ticking. At first he thought
  4996	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthis eerie, but soon concluded rightly that the clock had run down.
  4997	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  4998	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWithout giving a thought to what might be the feelings of a
  4999	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfellow-creature thus abruptly deprived of its closest companion, Peter
  5000	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbegan to consider how he could turn the catastrophe to his own use;
  5001	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand he decided to tick, so that wild beasts should believe he was the
  5002	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcrocodile and let him pass unmolested. He ticked superbly, but with one
  5003	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tunforeseen result. The crocodile was among those who heard the sound,
  5004	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand it followed him, though whether with the purpose of regaining what
  5005	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tit had lost, or merely as a friend under the belief that it was again
  5006	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tticking itself, will never be certainly known, for, like slaves to a
  5007	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfixed idea, it was a stupid beast.
  5008	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5009	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPeter reached the shore without mishap, and went straight on, his legs
  5010	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tencountering the water as if quite unaware that they had entered a new
  5011	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\telement. Thus many animals pass from land to water, but no other human
  5012	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tof whom I know. As he swam he had but one thought: “Hook or me this
  5013	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttime.” He had ticked so long that he now went on ticking without knowing
  5014	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthat he was doing it. Had he known he would have stopped, for to board
  5015	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe brig by help of the tick, though an ingenious idea, had not occurred
  5016	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tto him.
  5017	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5018	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tOn the contrary, he thought he had scaled her side as noiseless as a
  5019	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmouse; and he was amazed to see the pirates cowering from him, with Hook
  5020	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tin their midst as abject as if he had heard the crocodile.
  5021	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5022	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe crocodile! No sooner did Peter remember it than he heard the
  5023	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tticking. At first he thought the sound did come from the crocodile,
  5024	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand he looked behind him swiftly. Then he realised that he was doing it
  5025	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thimself, and in a flash he understood the situation. “How clever of me!”
  5026	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t he thought at once, and signed to the boys not to burst into applause.
  5027	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5028	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIt was at this moment that Ed Teynte the quartermaster emerged from the
  5029	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tforecastle and came along the deck. Now, reader, time what happened by
  5030	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tyour watch. Peter struck true and deep. John clapped his hands on the
  5031	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\till-fated pirate’s mouth to stifle the dying groan. He fell forward.
  5032	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tFour boys caught him to prevent the thud. Peter gave the signal, and the
  5033	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcarrion was cast overboard. There was a splash, and then silence. How
  5034	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlong has it taken?
  5035	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5036	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“One!” (Slightly had begun to count.)
  5037	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5038	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNone too soon, Peter, every inch of him on tiptoe, vanished into the
  5039	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcabin; for more than one pirate was screwing up his courage to look
  5040	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tround. They could hear each other’s distressed breathing now, which
  5041	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tshowed them that the more terrible sound had passed.
  5042	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5043	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“It’s gone, captain,” Smee said, wiping off his spectacles. “All’s still
  5044	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tagain.”
  5045	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5046	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tSlowly Hook let his head emerge from his ruff, and listened so intently
  5047	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthat he could have caught the echo of the tick. There was not a sound,
  5048	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand he drew himself up firmly to his full height.
  5049	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5050	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Then here’s to Johnny Plank!” he cried brazenly, hating the boys more
  5051	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthan ever because they had seen him unbend. He broke into the villainous
  5052	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tditty:
  5053	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5054	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t     “Yo ho, yo ho, the frisky plank,
  5055	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t     You walks along it so,
  5056	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t     Till it goes down and you goes down
  5057	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t     To Davy Jones below!”
  5058	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5059	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tTo terrorize the prisoners the more, though with a certain loss of
  5060	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdignity, he danced along an imaginary plank, grimacing at them as he
  5061	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsang; and when he finished he cried, “Do you want a touch of the cat [o’
  5062	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnine tails] before you walk the plank?”
  5063	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5064	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAt that they fell on their knees. “No, no!” they cried so piteously that
  5065	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tevery pirate smiled.
  5066	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5067	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Fetch the cat, Jukes,” said Hook; “it’s in the cabin.”
  5068	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5069	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe cabin! Peter was in the cabin! The children gazed at each other.
  5070	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5071	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Ay, ay,” said Jukes blithely, and he strode into the cabin. They
  5072	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfollowed him with their eyes; they scarce knew that Hook had resumed his
  5073	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsong, his dogs joining in with him:
  5074	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5075	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t     “Yo ho, yo ho, the scratching cat,
  5076	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t     Its tails are nine, you know,
  5077	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t     And when they’re writ upon your back--”
  5078	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5079	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWhat was the last line will never be known, for of a sudden the song was
  5080	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tstayed by a dreadful screech from the cabin. It wailed through the ship,
  5081	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand died away. Then was heard a crowing sound which was well understood
  5082	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tby the boys, but to the pirates was almost more eerie than the screech.
  5083	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5084	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“What was that?” cried Hook.
  5085	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5086	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Two,” said Slightly solemnly.
  5087	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5088	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe Italian Cecco hesitated for a moment and then swung into the cabin.
  5089	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe tottered out, haggard.
  5090	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5091	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“What’s the matter with Bill Jukes, you dog?” hissed Hook, towering over
  5092	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thim.
  5093	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5094	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“The matter wi’ him is he’s dead, stabbed,” replied Cecco in a hollow
  5095	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tvoice.
  5096	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5097	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Bill Jukes dead!” cried the startled pirates.
  5098	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5099	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“The cabin’s as black as a pit,” Cecco said, almost gibbering, “but
  5100	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthere is something terrible in there: the thing you heard crowing.”
  5101	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5102	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe exultation of the boys, the lowering looks of the pirates, both were
  5103	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tseen by Hook.
  5104	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5105	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Cecco,” he said in his most steely voice, “go back and fetch me out
  5106	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthat doodle-doo.”
  5107	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5108	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tCecco, bravest of the brave, cowered before his captain, crying “No,
  5109	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tno”; but Hook was purring to his claw.
  5110	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5111	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Did you say you would go, Cecco?” he said musingly.
  5112	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5113	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tCecco went, first flinging his arms despairingly. There was no more
  5114	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsinging, all listened now; and again came a death-screech and again a
  5115	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcrow.
  5116	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5117	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNo one spoke except Slightly. “Three,” he said.
  5118	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5119	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHook rallied his dogs with a gesture. “‘S’death and odds fish,” he
  5120	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthundered, “who is to bring me that doodle-doo?”
  5121	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5122	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Wait till Cecco comes out,” growled Starkey, and the others took up the
  5123	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcry.
  5124	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5125	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I think I heard you volunteer, Starkey,” said Hook, purring again.
  5126	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5127	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“No, by thunder!” Starkey cried.
  5128	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5129	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“My hook thinks you did,” said Hook, crossing to him. “I wonder if it
  5130	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twould not be advisable, Starkey, to humour the hook?”
  5131	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5132	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I’ll swing before I go in there,” replied Starkey doggedly, and again
  5133	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\the had the support of the crew.
  5134	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5135	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Is this mutiny?” asked Hook more pleasantly than ever. “Starkey’s
  5136	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tringleader!”
  5137	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5138	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Captain, mercy!” Starkey whimpered, all of a tremble now.
  5139	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5140	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Shake hands, Starkey,” said Hook, proffering his claw.
  5141	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5142	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tStarkey looked round for help, but all deserted him. As he backed up
  5143	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHook advanced, and now the red spark was in his eye. With a despairing
  5144	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tscream the pirate leapt upon Long Tom and precipitated himself into the
  5145	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsea.
  5146	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5147	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Four,” said Slightly.
  5148	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5149	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“And now,” Hook said courteously, “did any other gentlemen say mutiny?”
  5150	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t Seizing a lantern and raising his claw with a menacing gesture, “I’ll
  5151	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbring out that doodle-doo myself,” he said, and sped into the cabin.
  5152	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5153	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Five.” How Slightly longed to say it. He wetted his lips to be ready,
  5154	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbut Hook came staggering out, without his lantern.
  5155	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5156	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Something blew out the light,” he said a little unsteadily.
  5157	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5158	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Something!” echoed Mullins.
  5159	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5160	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“What of Cecco?” demanded Noodler.
  5161	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5162	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“He’s as dead as Jukes,” said Hook shortly.
  5163	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5164	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHis reluctance to return to the cabin impressed them all unfavourably,
  5165	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand the mutinous sounds again broke forth. All pirates are
  5166	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsuperstitious, and Cookson cried, “They do say the surest sign a ship’s
  5167	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\taccurst is when there’s one on board more than can be accounted for.”
  5168	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5169	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I’ve heard,” muttered Mullins, “he always boards the pirate craft last.
  5170	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHad he a tail, captain?”
  5171	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5172	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“They say,” said another, looking viciously at Hook, “that when he comes
  5173	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tit’s in the likeness of the wickedest man aboard.”
  5174	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5175	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Had he a hook, captain?” asked Cookson insolently; and one after
  5176	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tanother took up the cry, “The ship’s doomed!” At this the children could
  5177	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnot resist raising a cheer. Hook had well-nigh forgotten his prisoners,
  5178	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbut as he swung round on them now his face lit up again.
  5179	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5180	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Lads,” he cried to his crew, “now here’s a notion. Open the cabin door
  5181	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand drive them in. Let them fight the doodle-doo for their lives. If
  5182	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthey kill him, we’re so much the better; if he kills them, we’re none
  5183	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe worse.”
  5184	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5185	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tFor the last time his dogs admired Hook, and devotedly they did his
  5186	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbidding. The boys, pretending to struggle, were pushed into the cabin
  5187	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand the door was closed on them.
  5188	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5189	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Now, listen!” cried Hook, and all listened. But not one dared to face
  5190	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe door. Yes, one, Wendy, who all this time had been bound to the mast.
  5191	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIt was for neither a scream nor a crow that she was watching, it was for
  5192	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe reappearance of Peter.
  5193	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5194	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tShe had not long to wait. In the cabin he had found the thing for which
  5195	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\the had gone in search: the key that would free the children of their
  5196	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmanacles, and now they all stole forth, armed with such weapons as they
  5197	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcould find. First signing them to hide, Peter cut Wendy’s bonds,
  5198	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand then nothing could have been easier than for them all to fly off
  5199	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttogether; but one thing barred the way, an oath, “Hook or me this time.”
  5200	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t So when he had freed Wendy, he whispered for her to conceal herself with
  5201	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe others, and himself took her place by the mast, her cloak around him
  5202	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tso that he should pass for her. Then he took a great breath and crowed.
  5203	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5204	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tTo the pirates it was a voice crying that all the boys lay slain in the
  5205	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcabin; and they were panic-stricken. Hook tried to hearten them; but
  5206	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlike the dogs he had made them they showed him their fangs, and he knew
  5207	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthat if he took his eyes off them now they would leap at him.
  5208	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5209	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Lads,” he said, ready to cajole or strike as need be, but never
  5210	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tquailing for an instant, “I’ve thought it out. There’s a Jonah aboard.”
  5211	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5212	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Ay,” they snarled, “a man wi’ a hook.”
  5213	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5214	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“No, lads, no, it’s the girl. Never was luck on a pirate ship wi’ a
  5215	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twoman on board. We’ll right the ship when she’s gone.”
  5216	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5217	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tSome of them remembered that this had been a saying of Flint’s. “It’s
  5218	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tworth trying,” they said doubtfully.
  5219	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5220	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Fling the girl overboard,” cried Hook; and they made a rush at the
  5221	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfigure in the cloak.
  5222	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5223	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“There’s none can save you now, missy,” Mullins hissed jeeringly.
  5224	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5225	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“There’s one,” replied the figure.
  5226	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5227	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Who’s that?”
  5228	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5229	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Peter Pan the avenger!” came the terrible answer; and as he spoke Peter
  5230	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tflung off his cloak. Then they all knew who ‘twas that had been undoing
  5231	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthem in the cabin, and twice Hook essayed to speak and twice he failed.
  5232	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIn that frightful moment I think his fierce heart broke.
  5233	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5234	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAt last he cried, “Cleave him to the brisket!” but without conviction.
  5235	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5236	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Down, boys, and at them!” Peter’s voice rang out; and in another moment
  5237	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe clash of arms was resounding through the ship. Had the pirates kept
  5238	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttogether it is certain that they would have won; but the onset came
  5239	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twhen they were still unstrung, and they ran hither and thither, striking
  5240	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twildly, each thinking himself the last survivor of the crew. Man to man
  5241	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthey were the stronger; but they fought on the defensive only, which
  5242	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tenabled the boys to hunt in pairs and choose their quarry. Some of the
  5243	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmiscreants leapt into the sea; others hid in dark recesses, where they
  5244	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twere found by Slightly, who did not fight, but ran about with a lantern
  5245	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twhich he flashed in their faces, so that they were half blinded and
  5246	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfell as an easy prey to the reeking swords of the other boys. There was
  5247	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlittle sound to be heard but the clang of weapons, an occasional
  5248	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tscreech or splash, and Slightly monotonously counting--five--six--seven
  5249	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\teight--nine--ten--eleven.
  5250	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5251	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tI think all were gone when a group of savage boys surrounded Hook, who
  5252	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tseemed to have a charmed life, as he kept them at bay in that circle
  5253	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tof fire. They had done for his dogs, but this man alone seemed to be a
  5254	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmatch for them all. Again and again they closed upon him, and again and
  5255	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tagain he hewed a clear space. He had lifted up one boy with his hook,
  5256	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand was using him as a buckler [shield], when another, who had just
  5257	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tpassed his sword through Mullins, sprang into the fray.
  5258	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5259	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Put up your swords, boys,” cried the newcomer, “this man is mine.”
  5260	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5261	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThus suddenly Hook found himself face to face with Peter. The others
  5262	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdrew back and formed a ring around them.
  5263	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5264	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tFor long the two enemies looked at one another, Hook shuddering
  5265	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tslightly, and Peter with the strange smile upon his face.
  5266	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5267	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“So, Pan,” said Hook at last, “this is all your doing.”
  5268	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5269	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Ay, James Hook,” came the stern answer, “it is all my doing.”
  5270	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5271	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Proud and insolent youth,” said Hook, “prepare to meet thy doom.”
  5272	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5273	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Dark and sinister man,” Peter answered, “have at thee.”
  5274	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5275	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWithout more words they fell to, and for a space there was no advantage
  5276	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tto either blade. Peter was a superb swordsman, and parried with dazzling
  5277	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\trapidity; ever and anon he followed up a feint with a lunge that got
  5278	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tpast his foe’s defence, but his shorter reach stood him in ill stead,
  5279	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand he could not drive the steel home. Hook, scarcely his inferior in
  5280	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbrilliancy, but not quite so nimble in wrist play, forced him back by
  5281	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe weight of his onset, hoping suddenly to end all with a favourite
  5282	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthrust, taught him long ago by Barbecue at Rio; but to his astonishment
  5283	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\the found this thrust turned aside again and again. Then he sought to
  5284	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tclose and give the quietus with his iron hook, which all this time had
  5285	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbeen pawing the air; but Peter doubled under it and, lunging fiercely,
  5286	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tpierced him in the ribs. At the sight of his own blood, whose peculiar
  5287	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcolour, you remember, was offensive to him, the sword fell from Hook’s
  5288	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thand, and he was at Peter’s mercy.
  5289	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5290	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Now!” cried all the boys, but with a magnificent gesture Peter invited
  5291	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\this opponent to pick up his sword. Hook did so instantly, but with a
  5292	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttragic feeling that Peter was showing good form.
  5293	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5294	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHitherto he had thought it was some fiend fighting him, but darker
  5295	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsuspicions assailed him now.
  5296	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5297	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Pan, who and what art thou?” he cried huskily.
  5298	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5299	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I’m youth, I’m joy,” Peter answered at a venture, “I’m a little bird
  5300	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthat has broken out of the egg.”
  5301	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5302	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThis, of course, was nonsense; but it was proof to the unhappy Hook that
  5303	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPeter did not know in the least who or what he was, which is the very
  5304	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tpinnacle of good form.
  5305	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5306	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“To’t again,” he cried despairingly.
  5307	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5308	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe fought now like a human flail, and every sweep of that terrible sword
  5309	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twould have severed in twain any man or boy who obstructed it; but Peter
  5310	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfluttered round him as if the very wind it made blew him out of the
  5311	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdanger zone. And again and again he darted in and pricked.
  5312	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5313	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHook was fighting now without hope. That passionate breast no longer
  5314	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tasked for life; but for one boon it craved: to see Peter show bad form
  5315	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbefore it was cold forever.
  5316	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5317	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAbandoning the fight he rushed into the powder magazine and fired it.
  5318	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5319	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“In two minutes,” he cried, “the ship will be blown to pieces.”
  5320	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5321	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNow, now, he thought, true form will show.
  5322	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5323	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tBut Peter issued from the powder magazine with the shell in his hands,
  5324	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand calmly flung it overboard.
  5325	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5326	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWhat sort of form was Hook himself showing? Misguided man though he was,
  5327	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twe may be glad, without sympathising with him, that in the end he was
  5328	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttrue to the traditions of his race. The other boys were flying around
  5329	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thim now, flouting, scornful; and he staggered about the deck striking up
  5330	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tat them impotently, his mind was no longer with them; it was slouching
  5331	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tin the playing fields of long ago, or being sent up [to the headmaster]
  5332	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfor good, or watching the wall-game from a famous wall. And his shoes
  5333	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twere right, and his waistcoat was right, and his tie was right, and his
  5334	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsocks were right.
  5335	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5336	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tJames Hook, thou not wholly unheroic figure, farewell.
  5337	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5338	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tFor we have come to his last moment.
  5339	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5340	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tSeeing Peter slowly advancing upon him through the air with dagger
  5341	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tpoised, he sprang upon the bulwarks to cast himself into the sea. He
  5342	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdid not know that the crocodile was waiting for him; for we purposely
  5343	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tstopped the clock that this knowledge might be spared him: a little mark
  5344	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tof respect from us at the end.
  5345	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5346	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe had one last triumph, which I think we need not grudge him. As he
  5347	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tstood on the bulwark looking over his shoulder at Peter gliding through
  5348	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe air, he invited him with a gesture to use his foot. It made Peter
  5349	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tkick instead of stab.
  5350	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5351	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAt last Hook had got the boon for which he craved.
  5352	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5353	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Bad form,” he cried jeeringly, and went content to the crocodile.
  5354	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5355	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThus perished James Hook.
  5356	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5357	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Seventeen,” Slightly sang out; but he was not quite correct in his
  5358	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfigures. Fifteen paid the penalty for their crimes that night; but two
  5359	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\treached the shore: Starkey to be captured by the redskins, who made him
  5360	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnurse for all their papooses, a melancholy come-down for a pirate; and
  5361	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tSmee, who henceforth wandered about the world in his spectacles, making
  5362	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ta precarious living by saying he was the only man that Jas. Hook had
  5363	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfeared.
  5364	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5365	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWendy, of course, had stood by taking no part in the fight, though
  5366	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twatching Peter with glistening eyes; but now that all was over she
  5367	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbecame prominent again. She praised them equally, and shuddered
  5368	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdelightfully when Michael showed her the place where he had killed one;
  5369	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand then she took them into Hook’s cabin and pointed to his watch which
  5370	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twas hanging on a nail. It said “half-past one!”
  5371	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5372	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe lateness of the hour was almost the biggest thing of all. She got
  5373	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthem to bed in the pirates’ bunks pretty quickly, you may be sure; all
  5374	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbut Peter, who strutted up and down on the deck, until at last he fell
  5375	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tasleep by the side of Long Tom. He had one of his dreams that night, and
  5376	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcried in his sleep for a long time, and Wendy held him tightly.
  5377	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t

  5381	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tChapter 16 THE RETURN HOME
  5382	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5383	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tBy three bells that morning they were all stirring their stumps [legs];
  5384	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfor there was a big sea running; and Tootles, the bo’sun, was among
  5385	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthem, with a rope’s end in his hand and chewing tobacco. They all donned
  5386	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tpirate clothes cut off at the knee, shaved smartly, and tumbled up, with
  5387	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe true nautical roll and hitching their trousers.
  5388	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5389	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIt need not be said who was the captain. Nibs and John were first and
  5390	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsecond mate. There was a woman aboard. The rest were tars [sailors]
  5391	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbefore the mast, and lived in the fo’c’sle. Peter had already lashed
  5392	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thimself to the wheel; but he piped all hands and delivered a short
  5393	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\taddress to them; said he hoped they would do their duty like gallant
  5394	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thearties, but that he knew they were the scum of Rio and the Gold Coast,
  5395	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand if they snapped at him he would tear them. The bluff strident words
  5396	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tstruck the note sailors understood, and they cheered him lustily. Then
  5397	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ta few sharp orders were given, and they turned the ship round, and nosed
  5398	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ther for the mainland.
  5399	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5400	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tCaptain Pan calculated, after consulting the ship’s chart, that if this
  5401	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tweather lasted they should strike the Azores about the 21st of June,
  5402	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tafter which it would save time to fly.
  5403	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5404	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tSome of them wanted it to be an honest ship and others were in favour
  5405	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tof keeping it a pirate; but the captain treated them as dogs, and they
  5406	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdared not express their wishes to him even in a round robin [one person
  5407	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tafter another, as they had to Cpt. Hook]. Instant obedience was the only
  5408	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsafe thing. Slightly got a dozen for looking perplexed when told to take
  5409	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsoundings. The general feeling was that Peter was honest just now to
  5410	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlull Wendy’s suspicions, but that there might be a change when the new
  5411	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsuit was ready, which, against her will, she was making for him out of
  5412	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsome of Hook’s wickedest garments. It was afterwards whispered among
  5413	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthem that on the first night he wore this suit he sat long in the cabin
  5414	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twith Hook’s cigar-holder in his mouth and one hand clenched, all but for
  5415	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe forefinger, which he bent and held threateningly aloft like a hook.
  5416	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5417	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tInstead of watching the ship, however, we must now return to that
  5418	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdesolate home from which three of our characters had taken heartless
  5419	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tflight so long ago. It seems a shame to have neglected No. 14 all this
  5420	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttime; and yet we may be sure that Mrs. Darling does not blame us. If we
  5421	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thad returned sooner to look with sorrowful sympathy at her, she would
  5422	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tprobably have cried, “Don’t be silly; what do I matter? Do go back and
  5423	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tkeep an eye on the children.” So long as mothers are like this their
  5424	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tchildren will take advantage of them; and they may lay to [bet on] that.
  5425	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5426	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tEven now we venture into that familiar nursery only because its lawful
  5427	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\toccupants are on their way home; we are merely hurrying on in advance
  5428	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tof them to see that their beds are properly aired and that Mr. and Mrs.
  5429	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tDarling do not go out for the evening. We are no more than servants. Why
  5430	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ton earth should their beds be properly aired, seeing that they left them
  5431	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tin such a thankless hurry? Would it not serve them jolly well right if
  5432	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthey came back and found that their parents were spending the week-end
  5433	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tin the country? It would be the moral lesson they have been in need
  5434	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tof ever since we met them; but if we contrived things in this way Mrs.
  5435	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tDarling would never forgive us.
  5436	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5437	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tOne thing I should like to do immensely, and that is to tell her, in the
  5438	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tway authors have, that the children are coming back, that indeed they
  5439	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twill be here on Thursday week. This would spoil so completely the
  5440	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsurprise to which Wendy and John and Michael are looking forward. They
  5441	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thave been planning it out on the ship: mother’s rapture, father’s shout
  5442	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tof joy, Nana’s leap through the air to embrace them first, when what
  5443	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthey ought to be prepared for is a good hiding. How delicious to spoil
  5444	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tit all by breaking the news in advance; so that when they enter grandly
  5445	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tMrs. Darling may not even offer Wendy her mouth, and Mr. Darling may
  5446	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\texclaim pettishly, “Dash it all, here are those boys again.” However,
  5447	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twe should get no thanks even for this. We are beginning to know Mrs.
  5448	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tDarling by this time, and may be sure that she would upbraid us for
  5449	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdepriving the children of their little pleasure.
  5450	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5451	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“But, my dear madam, it is ten days till Thursday week; so that by
  5452	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttelling you what’s what, we can save you ten days of unhappiness.”
  5453	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5454	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Yes, but at what a cost! By depriving the children of ten minutes of
  5455	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdelight.”
  5456	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5457	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Oh, if you look at it in that way!”
  5458	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5459	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“What other way is there in which to look at it?”
  5460	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5461	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tYou see, the woman had no proper spirit. I had meant to say
  5462	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\textraordinarily nice things about her; but I despise her, and not one of
  5463	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthem will I say now. She does not really need to be told to have things
  5464	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tready, for they are ready. All the beds are aired, and she never leaves
  5465	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe house, and observe, the window is open. For all the use we are to
  5466	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ther, we might well go back to the ship. However, as we are here we may
  5467	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tas well stay and look on. That is all we are, lookers-on. Nobody really
  5468	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twants us. So let us watch and say jaggy things, in the hope that some of
  5469	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthem will hurt.
  5470	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5471	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe only change to be seen in the night-nursery is that between nine
  5472	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand six the kennel is no longer there. When the children flew away, Mr.
  5473	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tDarling felt in his bones that all the blame was his for having chained
  5474	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNana up, and that from first to last she had been wiser than he. Of
  5475	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcourse, as we have seen, he was quite a simple man; indeed he might have
  5476	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tpassed for a boy again if he had been able to take his baldness off;
  5477	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbut he had also a noble sense of justice and a lion’s courage to do what
  5478	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tseemed right to him; and having thought the matter out with anxious care
  5479	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tafter the flight of the children, he went down on all fours and crawled
  5480	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tinto the kennel. To all Mrs. Darling’s dear invitations to him to come
  5481	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tout he replied sadly but firmly:
  5482	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5483	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“No, my own one, this is the place for me.”
  5484	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5485	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIn the bitterness of his remorse he swore that he would never leave
  5486	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe kennel until his children came back. Of course this was a pity; but
  5487	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twhatever Mr. Darling did he had to do in excess, otherwise he soon gave
  5488	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tup doing it. And there never was a more humble man than the once proud
  5489	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tGeorge Darling, as he sat in the kennel of an evening talking with his
  5490	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twife of their children and all their pretty ways.
  5491	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5492	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tVery touching was his deference to Nana. He would not let her come into
  5493	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe kennel, but on all other matters he followed her wishes implicitly.
  5494	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5495	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tEvery morning the kennel was carried with Mr. Darling in it to a cab,
  5496	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twhich conveyed him to his office, and he returned home in the same way
  5497	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tat six. Something of the strength of character of the man will be seen
  5498	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tif we remember how sensitive he was to the opinion of neighbours: this
  5499	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tman whose every movement now attracted surprised attention. Inwardly he
  5500	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmust have suffered torture; but he preserved a calm exterior even when
  5501	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe young criticised his little home, and he always lifted his hat
  5502	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcourteously to any lady who looked inside.
  5503	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5504	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIt may have been Quixotic, but it was magnificent. Soon the inward
  5505	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmeaning of it leaked out, and the great heart of the public was touched.
  5506	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tCrowds followed the cab, cheering it lustily; charming girls scaled it
  5507	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tto get his autograph; interviews appeared in the better class of papers,
  5508	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand society invited him to dinner and added, “Do come in the kennel.”
  5509	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5510	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tOn that eventful Thursday week, Mrs. Darling was in the night-nursery
  5511	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tawaiting George’s return home; a very sad-eyed woman. Now that we look
  5512	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tat her closely and remember the gaiety of her in the old days, all gone
  5513	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnow just because she has lost her babes, I find I won’t be able to say
  5514	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnasty things about her after all. If she was too fond of her rubbishy
  5515	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tchildren, she couldn’t help it. Look at her in her chair, where she has
  5516	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfallen asleep. The corner of her mouth, where one looks first, is almost
  5517	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twithered up. Her hand moves restlessly on her breast as if she had a
  5518	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tpain there. Some like Peter best, and some like Wendy best, but I like
  5519	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ther best. Suppose, to make her happy, we whisper to her in her sleep
  5520	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthat the brats are coming back. They are really within two miles of the
  5521	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twindow now, and flying strong, but all we need whisper is that they are
  5522	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ton the way. Let’s.
  5523	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5524	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIt is a pity we did it, for she has started up, calling their names; and
  5525	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthere is no one in the room but Nana.
  5526	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5527	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“O Nana, I dreamt my dear ones had come back.”
  5528	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5529	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNana had filmy eyes, but all she could do was put her paw gently on her
  5530	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmistress’s lap; and they were sitting together thus when the kennel was
  5531	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbrought back. As Mr. Darling puts his head out to kiss his wife, we see
  5532	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthat his face is more worn than of yore, but has a softer expression.
  5533	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5534	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe gave his hat to Liza, who took it scornfully; for she had no
  5535	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\timagination, and was quite incapable of understanding the motives of
  5536	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsuch a man. Outside, the crowd who had accompanied the cab home were
  5537	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tstill cheering, and he was naturally not unmoved.
  5538	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5539	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Listen to them,” he said; “it is very gratifying.”
  5540	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5541	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Lots of little boys,” sneered Liza.
  5542	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5543	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“There were several adults to-day,” he assured her with a faint flush;
  5544	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbut when she tossed her head he had not a word of reproof for her.
  5545	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tSocial success had not spoilt him; it had made him sweeter. For some
  5546	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttime he sat with his head out of the kennel, talking with Mrs. Darling
  5547	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tof this success, and pressing her hand reassuringly when she said she
  5548	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thoped his head would not be turned by it.
  5549	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5550	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“But if I had been a weak man,” he said. “Good heavens, if I had been a
  5551	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tweak man!”
  5552	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5553	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“And, George,” she said timidly, “you are as full of remorse as ever,
  5554	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\taren’t you?”
  5555	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5556	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Full of remorse as ever, dearest! See my punishment: living in a
  5557	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tkennel.”
  5558	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5559	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“But it is punishment, isn’t it, George? You are sure you are not
  5560	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tenjoying it?”
  5561	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5562	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“My love!”
  5563	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5564	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tYou may be sure she begged his pardon; and then, feeling drowsy, he
  5565	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcurled round in the kennel.
  5566	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5567	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Won’t you play me to sleep,” he asked, “on the nursery piano?” and as
  5568	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tshe was crossing to the day-nursery he added thoughtlessly, “And shut
  5569	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthat window. I feel a draught.”
  5570	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5571	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“O George, never ask me to do that. The window must always be left open
  5572	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfor them, always, always.”
  5573	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5574	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNow it was his turn to beg her pardon; and she went into the day-nursery
  5575	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand played, and soon he was asleep; and while he slept, Wendy and John
  5576	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand Michael flew into the room.
  5577	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5578	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tOh no. We have written it so, because that was the charming arrangement
  5579	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tplanned by them before we left the ship; but something must have
  5580	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thappened since then, for it is not they who have flown in, it is Peter
  5581	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand Tinker Bell.
  5582	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5583	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPeter’s first words tell all.
  5584	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5585	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Quick Tink,” he whispered, “close the window; bar it! That’s right. Now
  5586	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tyou and I must get away by the door; and when Wendy comes she will think
  5587	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ther mother has barred her out; and she will have to go back with me.”
  5588	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5589	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNow I understand what had hitherto puzzled me, why when Peter had
  5590	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\texterminated the pirates he did not return to the island and leave Tink
  5591	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tto escort the children to the mainland. This trick had been in his head
  5592	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tall the time.
  5593	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5594	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tInstead of feeling that he was behaving badly he danced with glee; then
  5595	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\the peeped into the day-nursery to see who was playing. He whispered to
  5596	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tTink, “It’s Wendy’s mother! She is a pretty lady, but not so pretty as
  5597	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmy mother. Her mouth is full of thimbles, but not so full as my mother’s
  5598	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twas.”
  5599	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5600	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tOf course he knew nothing whatever about his mother; but he sometimes
  5601	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbragged about her.
  5602	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5603	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe did not know the tune, which was “Home, Sweet Home,” but he knew it
  5604	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twas saying, “Come back, Wendy, Wendy, Wendy”; and he cried exultantly,
  5605	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“You will never see Wendy again, lady, for the window is barred!”
  5606	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5607	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe peeped in again to see why the music had stopped, and now he saw
  5608	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthat Mrs. Darling had laid her head on the box, and that two tears were
  5609	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsitting on her eyes.
  5610	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5611	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“She wants me to unbar the window,” thought Peter, “but I won’t, not I!”
  5612	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5613	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe peeped again, and the tears were still there, or another two had
  5614	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttaken their place.
  5615	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5616	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“She’s awfully fond of Wendy,” he said to himself. He was angry with her
  5617	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnow for not seeing why she could not have Wendy.
  5618	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5619	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe reason was so simple: “I’m fond of her too. We can’t both have her,
  5620	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlady.”
  5621	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5622	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tBut the lady would not make the best of it, and he was unhappy. He
  5623	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tceased to look at her, but even then she would not let go of him. He
  5624	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tskipped about and made funny faces, but when he stopped it was just as
  5625	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tif she were inside him, knocking.
  5626	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5627	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Oh, all right,” he said at last, and gulped. Then he unbarred the
  5628	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twindow. “Come on, Tink,” he cried, with a frightful sneer at the laws of
  5629	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnature; “we don’t want any silly mothers;” and he flew away.
  5630	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5631	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThus Wendy and John and Michael found the window open for them after
  5632	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tall, which of course was more than they deserved. They alighted on the
  5633	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfloor, quite unashamed of themselves, and the youngest one had already
  5634	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tforgotten his home.
  5635	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5636	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“John,” he said, looking around him doubtfully, “I think I have been
  5637	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\there before.”
  5638	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5639	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Of course you have, you silly. There is your old bed.”
  5640	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5641	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“So it is,” Michael said, but not with much conviction.
  5642	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5643	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I say,” cried John, “the kennel!” and he dashed across to look into it.
  5644	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5645	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Perhaps Nana is inside it,” Wendy said.
  5646	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5647	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tBut John whistled. “Hullo,” he said, “there’s a man inside it.”
  5648	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5649	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“It’s father!” exclaimed Wendy.
  5650	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5651	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Let me see father,” Michael begged eagerly, and he took a good look.
  5652	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“He is not so big as the pirate I killed,” he said with such frank
  5653	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdisappointment that I am glad Mr. Darling was asleep; it would have been
  5654	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsad if those had been the first words he heard his little Michael say.
  5655	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5656	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWendy and John had been taken aback somewhat at finding their father in
  5657	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe kennel.
  5658	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5659	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Surely,” said John, like one who had lost faith in his memory, “he used
  5660	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnot to sleep in the kennel?”
  5661	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5662	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“John,” Wendy said falteringly, “perhaps we don’t remember the old life
  5663	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tas well as we thought we did.”
  5664	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5665	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tA chill fell upon them; and serve them right.
  5666	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5667	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“It is very careless of mother,” said that young scoundrel John, “not to
  5668	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbe here when we come back.”
  5669	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5670	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIt was then that Mrs. Darling began playing again.
  5671	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5672	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“It’s mother!” cried Wendy, peeping.
  5673	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5674	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“So it is!” said John.
  5675	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5676	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Then are you not really our mother, Wendy?” asked Michael, who was
  5677	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsurely sleepy.
  5678	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5679	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Oh dear!” exclaimed Wendy, with her first real twinge of remorse [for
  5680	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thaving gone], “it was quite time we came back.”
  5681	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5682	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Let us creep in,” John suggested, “and put our hands over her eyes.”
  5683	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5684	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tBut Wendy, who saw that they must break the joyous news more gently, had
  5685	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ta better plan.
  5686	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5687	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Let us all slip into our beds, and be there when she comes in, just as
  5688	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tif we had never been away.”
  5689	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5690	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAnd so when Mrs. Darling went back to the night-nursery to see if her
  5691	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thusband was asleep, all the beds were occupied. The children waited
  5692	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfor her cry of joy, but it did not come. She saw them, but she did not
  5693	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbelieve they were there. You see, she saw them in their beds so often in
  5694	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ther dreams that she thought this was just the dream hanging around her
  5695	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tstill.
  5696	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5697	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tShe sat down in the chair by the fire, where in the old days she had
  5698	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnursed them.
  5699	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5700	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThey could not understand this, and a cold fear fell upon all the three
  5701	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tof them.
  5702	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5703	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Mother!” Wendy cried.
  5704	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5705	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“That’s Wendy,” she said, but still she was sure it was the dream.
  5706	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5707	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Mother!”
  5708	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5709	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“That’s John,” she said.
  5710	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5711	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Mother!” cried Michael. He knew her now.
  5712	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5713	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“That’s Michael,” she said, and she stretched out her arms for the three
  5714	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlittle selfish children they would never envelop again. Yes, they did,
  5715	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthey went round Wendy and John and Michael, who had slipped out of bed
  5716	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand run to her.
  5717	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5718	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“George, George!” she cried when she could speak; and Mr. Darling woke
  5719	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tto share her bliss, and Nana came rushing in. There could not have been
  5720	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ta lovelier sight; but there was none to see it except a little boy who
  5721	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twas staring in at the window. He had had ecstasies innumerable that
  5722	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tother children can never know; but he was looking through the window at
  5723	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe one joy from which he must be for ever barred.
  5724	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5725	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5726	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5727	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5728	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tChapter 17 WHEN WENDY GREW UP
  5729	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5730	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tI hope you want to know what became of the other boys. They were waiting
  5731	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbelow to give Wendy time to explain about them; and when they had
  5732	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcounted five hundred they went up. They went up by the stair, because
  5733	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthey thought this would make a better impression. They stood in a row
  5734	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tin front of Mrs. Darling, with their hats off, and wishing they were not
  5735	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twearing their pirate clothes. They said nothing, but their eyes asked
  5736	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ther to have them. They ought to have looked at Mr. Darling also, but
  5737	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthey forgot about him.
  5738	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5739	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tOf course Mrs. Darling said at once that she would have them; but Mr.
  5740	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tDarling was curiously depressed, and they saw that he considered six a
  5741	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\trather large number.
  5742	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5743	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I must say,” he said to Wendy, “that you don’t do things by halves,” a
  5744	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tgrudging remark which the twins thought was pointed at them.
  5745	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5746	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThe first twin was the proud one, and he asked, flushing, “Do you think
  5747	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twe should be too much of a handful, sir? Because, if so, we can go
  5748	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\taway.”
  5749	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5750	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Father!” Wendy cried, shocked; but still the cloud was on him. He knew
  5751	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\the was behaving unworthily, but he could not help it.
  5752	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5753	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“We could lie doubled up,” said Nibs.
  5754	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5755	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I always cut their hair myself,” said Wendy.
  5756	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5757	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“George!” Mrs. Darling exclaimed, pained to see her dear one showing
  5758	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thimself in such an unfavourable light.
  5759	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5760	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThen he burst into tears, and the truth came out. He was as glad to
  5761	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thave them as she was, he said, but he thought they should have asked his
  5762	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tconsent as well as hers, instead of treating him as a cypher [zero] in
  5763	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\this own house.
  5764	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5765	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I don’t think he is a cypher,” Tootles cried instantly. “Do you think
  5766	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\the is a cypher, Curly?”
  5767	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5768	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“No, I don’t. Do you think he is a cypher, Slightly?”
  5769	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5770	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Rather not. Twin, what do you think?”
  5771	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5772	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIt turned out that not one of them thought him a cypher; and he was
  5773	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tabsurdly gratified, and said he would find space for them all in the
  5774	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdrawing-room if they fitted in.
  5775	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5776	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“We’ll fit in, sir,” they assured him.
  5777	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5778	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Then follow the leader,” he cried gaily. “Mind you, I am not sure that
  5779	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twe have a drawing-room, but we pretend we have, and it’s all the same.
  5780	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHoop la!”
  5781	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5782	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe went off dancing through the house, and they all cried “Hoop la!” and
  5783	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdanced after him, searching for the drawing-room; and I forget whether
  5784	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthey found it, but at any rate they found corners, and they all fitted
  5785	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tin.
  5786	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5787	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAs for Peter, he saw Wendy once again before he flew away. He did not
  5788	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\texactly come to the window, but he brushed against it in passing so that
  5789	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tshe could open it if she liked and call to him. That is what she did.
  5790	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5791	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Hullo, Wendy, good-bye,” he said.
  5792	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5793	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Oh dear, are you going away?”
  5794	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5795	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Yes.”
  5796	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5797	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“You don’t feel, Peter,” she said falteringly, “that you would like to
  5798	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsay anything to my parents about a very sweet subject?”
  5799	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5800	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“No.”
  5801	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5802	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“About me, Peter?”
  5803	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5804	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“No.”
  5805	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5806	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tMrs. Darling came to the window, for at present she was keeping a sharp
  5807	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\teye on Wendy. She told Peter that she had adopted all the other boys,
  5808	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand would like to adopt him also.
  5809	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5810	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Would you send me to school?” he inquired craftily.
  5811	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5812	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Yes.”
  5813	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5814	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“And then to an office?”
  5815	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5816	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I suppose so.”
  5817	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5818	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Soon I would be a man?”
  5819	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5820	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Very soon.”
  5821	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5822	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I don’t want to go to school and learn solemn things,” he told her
  5823	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tpassionately. “I don’t want to be a man. O Wendy’s mother, if I was to
  5824	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twake up and feel there was a beard!”
  5825	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5826	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Peter,” said Wendy the comforter, “I should love you in a beard;” and
  5827	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tMrs. Darling stretched out her arms to him, but he repulsed her.
  5828	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5829	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Keep back, lady, no one is going to catch me and make me a man.”
  5830	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5831	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“But where are you going to live?”
  5832	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5833	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“With Tink in the house we built for Wendy. The fairies are to put it
  5834	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thigh up among the tree tops where they sleep at nights.”
  5835	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5836	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“How lovely,” cried Wendy so longingly that Mrs. Darling tightened her
  5837	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tgrip.
  5838	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5839	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I thought all the fairies were dead,” Mrs. Darling said.
  5840	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5841	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“There are always a lot of young ones,” explained Wendy, who was now
  5842	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tquite an authority, “because you see when a new baby laughs for the
  5843	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfirst time a new fairy is born, and as there are always new babies there
  5844	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tare always new fairies. They live in nests on the tops of trees; and the
  5845	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmauve ones are boys and the white ones are girls, and the blue ones are
  5846	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tjust little sillies who are not sure what they are.”
  5847	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5848	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I shall have such fun,” said Peter, with eye on Wendy.
  5849	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5850	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“It will be rather lonely in the evening,” she said, “sitting by the
  5851	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfire.”
  5852	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5853	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I shall have Tink.”
  5854	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5855	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Tink can’t go a twentieth part of the way round,” she reminded him a
  5856	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlittle tartly.
  5857	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5858	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Sneaky tell-tale!” Tink called out from somewhere round the corner.
  5859	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5860	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“It doesn’t matter,” Peter said.
  5861	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5862	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“O Peter, you know it matters.”
  5863	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5864	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Well, then, come with me to the little house.”
  5865	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5866	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“May I, mummy?”
  5867	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5868	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Certainly not. I have got you home again, and I mean to keep you.”
  5869	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5870	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“But he does so need a mother.”
  5871	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5872	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“So do you, my love.”
  5873	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5874	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Oh, all right,” Peter said, as if he had asked her from politeness
  5875	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmerely; but Mrs. Darling saw his mouth twitch, and she made this
  5876	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thandsome offer: to let Wendy go to him for a week every year to do
  5877	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\this spring cleaning. Wendy would have preferred a more permanent
  5878	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tarrangement; and it seemed to her that spring would be long in coming;
  5879	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbut this promise sent Peter away quite gay again. He had no sense of
  5880	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttime, and was so full of adventures that all I have told you about him
  5881	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tis only a halfpenny-worth of them. I suppose it was because Wendy knew
  5882	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthis that her last words to him were these rather plaintive ones:
  5883	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5884	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“You won’t forget me, Peter, will you, before spring cleaning time
  5885	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcomes?”
  5886	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5887	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tOf course Peter promised; and then he flew away. He took Mrs. Darling’s
  5888	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tkiss with him. The kiss that had been for no one else, Peter took quite
  5889	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\teasily. Funny. But she seemed satisfied.
  5890	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5891	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tOf course all the boys went to school; and most of them got into Class
  5892	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tIII, but Slightly was put first into Class IV and then into Class V.
  5893	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tClass I is the top class. Before they had attended school a week they
  5894	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsaw what goats they had been not to remain on the island; but it was too
  5895	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlate now, and soon they settled down to being as ordinary as you or me
  5896	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tor Jenkins minor [the younger Jenkins]. It is sad to have to say that
  5897	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe power to fly gradually left them. At first Nana tied their feet to
  5898	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe bed-posts so that they should not fly away in the night; and one of
  5899	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttheir diversions by day was to pretend to fall off buses [the English
  5900	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdouble-deckers]; but by and by they ceased to tug at their bonds in bed,
  5901	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand found that they hurt themselves when they let go of the bus. In time
  5902	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthey could not even fly after their hats. Want of practice, they called
  5903	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tit; but what it really meant was that they no longer believed.
  5904	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5905	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tMichael believed longer than the other boys, though they jeered at him;
  5906	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tso he was with Wendy when Peter came for her at the end of the first
  5907	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tyear. She flew away with Peter in the frock she had woven from leaves
  5908	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand berries in the Neverland, and her one fear was that he might notice
  5909	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thow short it had become; but he never noticed, he had so much to say
  5910	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tabout himself.
  5911	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5912	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tShe had looked forward to thrilling talks with him about old times, but
  5913	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tnew adventures had crowded the old ones from his mind.
  5914	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5915	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Who is Captain Hook?” he asked with interest when she spoke of the arch
  5916	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tenemy.
  5917	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5918	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Don’t you remember,” she asked, amazed, “how you killed him and saved
  5919	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tall our lives?”
  5920	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5921	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I forget them after I kill them,” he replied carelessly.
  5922	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5923	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWhen she expressed a doubtful hope that Tinker Bell would be glad to see
  5924	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ther he said, “Who is Tinker Bell?”
  5925	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5926	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“O Peter,” she said, shocked; but even when she explained he could not
  5927	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tremember.
  5928	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5929	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“There are such a lot of them,” he said. “I expect she is no more.”
  5930	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5931	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tI expect he was right, for fairies don’t live long, but they are so
  5932	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlittle that a short time seems a good while to them.
  5933	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5934	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWendy was pained too to find that the past year was but as yesterday
  5935	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tto Peter; it had seemed such a long year of waiting to her. But he was
  5936	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\texactly as fascinating as ever, and they had a lovely spring cleaning in
  5937	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe little house on the tree tops.
  5938	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5939	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNext year he did not come for her. She waited in a new frock because the
  5940	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\told one simply would not meet; but he never came.
  5941	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5942	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Perhaps he is ill,” Michael said.
  5943	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5944	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“You know he is never ill.”
  5945	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5946	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tMichael came close to her and whispered, with a shiver, “Perhaps there
  5947	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tis no such person, Wendy!” and then Wendy would have cried if Michael
  5948	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thad not been crying.
  5949	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5950	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPeter came next spring cleaning; and the strange thing was that he never
  5951	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tknew he had missed a year.
  5952	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5953	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThat was the last time the girl Wendy ever saw him. For a little longer
  5954	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tshe tried for his sake not to have growing pains; and she felt she was
  5955	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tuntrue to him when she got a prize for general knowledge. But the years
  5956	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcame and went without bringing the careless boy; and when they met again
  5957	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWendy was a married woman, and Peter was no more to her than a little
  5958	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdust in the box in which she had kept her toys. Wendy was grown up. You
  5959	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tneed not be sorry for her. She was one of the kind that likes to grow
  5960	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tup. In the end she grew up of her own free will a day quicker than other
  5961	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tgirls.
  5962	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5963	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAll the boys were grown up and done for by this time; so it is scarcely
  5964	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tworth while saying anything more about them. You may see the twins and
  5965	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNibs and Curly any day going to an office, each carrying a little bag
  5966	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand an umbrella. Michael is an engine-driver [train engineer]. Slightly
  5967	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmarried a lady of title, and so he became a lord. You see that judge in
  5968	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ta wig coming out at the iron door? That used to be Tootles. The bearded
  5969	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tman who doesn’t know any story to tell his children was once John.
  5970	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5971	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWendy was married in white with a pink sash. It is strange to think
  5972	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthat Peter did not alight in the church and forbid the banns [formal
  5973	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tannouncement of a marriage].
  5974	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5975	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tYears rolled on again, and Wendy had a daughter. This ought not to be
  5976	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twritten in ink but in a golden splash.
  5977	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5978	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tShe was called Jane, and always had an odd inquiring look, as if from
  5979	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe moment she arrived on the mainland she wanted to ask questions. When
  5980	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tshe was old enough to ask them they were mostly about Peter Pan. She
  5981	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tloved to hear of Peter, and Wendy told her all she could remember in the
  5982	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tvery nursery from which the famous flight had taken place. It was
  5983	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tJane’s nursery now, for her father had bought it at the three per cents
  5984	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t[mortgage rate] from Wendy’s father, who was no longer fond of stairs.
  5985	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tMrs. Darling was now dead and forgotten.
  5986	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5987	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThere were only two beds in the nursery now, Jane’s and her nurse’s; and
  5988	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthere was no kennel, for Nana also had passed away. She died of old age,
  5989	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand at the end she had been rather difficult to get on with; being very
  5990	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfirmly convinced that no one knew how to look after children except
  5991	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\therself.
  5992	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5993	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tOnce a week Jane’s nurse had her evening off; and then it was Wendy’s
  5994	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tpart to put Jane to bed. That was the time for stories. It was Jane’s
  5995	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tinvention to raise the sheet over her mother’s head and her own, thus
  5996	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tmaking a tent, and in the awful darkness to whisper:
  5997	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  5998	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“What do we see now?”
  5999	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6000	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I don’t think I see anything to-night,” says Wendy, with a feeling that
  6001	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tif Nana were here she would object to further conversation.
  6002	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6003	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Yes, you do,” says Jane, “you see when you were a little girl.”
  6004	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6005	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“That is a long time ago, sweetheart,” says Wendy. “Ah me, how time
  6006	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tflies!”
  6007	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6008	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Does it fly,” asks the artful child, “the way you flew when you were a
  6009	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlittle girl?”
  6010	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6011	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“The way I flew? Do you know, Jane, I sometimes wonder whether I ever
  6012	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdid really fly.”
  6013	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6014	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Yes, you did.”
  6015	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6016	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“The dear old days when I could fly!”
  6017	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6018	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Why can’t you fly now, mother?”
  6019	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6020	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Because I am grown up, dearest. When people grow up they forget the
  6021	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tway.”
  6022	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6023	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Why do they forget the way?”
  6024	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6025	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Because they are no longer gay and innocent and heartless. It is only
  6026	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe gay and innocent and heartless who can fly.”
  6027	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6028	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“What is gay and innocent and heartless? I do wish I were gay and
  6029	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tinnocent and heartless.”
  6030	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6031	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tOr perhaps Wendy admits she does see something.
  6032	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6033	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I do believe,” she says, “that it is this nursery.”
  6034	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6035	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I do believe it is,” says Jane. “Go on.”
  6036	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6037	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThey are now embarked on the great adventure of the night when Peter
  6038	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tflew in looking for his shadow.
  6039	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6040	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“The foolish fellow,” says Wendy, “tried to stick it on with soap, and
  6041	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twhen he could not he cried, and that woke me, and I sewed it on for
  6042	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thim.”
  6043	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6044	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“You have missed a bit,” interrupts Jane, who now knows the story better
  6045	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthan her mother. “When you saw him sitting on the floor crying, what did
  6046	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tyou say?”
  6047	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6048	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I sat up in bed and I said, ‘Boy, why are you crying?’”
  6049	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6050	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Yes, that was it,” says Jane, with a big breath.
  6051	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6052	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“And then he flew us all away to the Neverland and the fairies and the
  6053	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tpirates and the redskins and the mermaids’ lagoon, and the home under
  6054	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe ground, and the little house.”
  6055	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6056	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Yes! which did you like best of all?”
  6057	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6058	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I think I liked the home under the ground best of all.”
  6059	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6060	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Yes, so do I. What was the last thing Peter ever said to you?”
  6061	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6062	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“The last thing he ever said to me was, ‘Just always be waiting for me,
  6063	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand then some night you will hear me crowing.’”
  6064	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6065	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Yes.”
  6066	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6067	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“But, alas, he forgot all about me,” Wendy said it with a smile. She was
  6068	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tas grown up as that.
  6069	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6070	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“What did his crow sound like?” Jane asked one evening.
  6071	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6072	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“It was like this,” Wendy said, trying to imitate Peter’s crow.
  6073	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6074	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“No, it wasn’t,” Jane said gravely, “it was like this;” and she did it
  6075	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tever so much better than her mother.
  6076	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6077	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWendy was a little startled. “My darling, how can you know?”
  6078	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6079	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I often hear it when I am sleeping,” Jane said.
  6080	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6081	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Ah yes, many girls hear it when they are sleeping, but I was the only
  6082	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tone who heard it awake.”
  6083	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6084	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Lucky you,” said Jane.
  6085	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6086	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAnd then one night came the tragedy. It was the spring of the year, and
  6087	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe story had been told for the night, and Jane was now asleep in her
  6088	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tbed. Wendy was sitting on the floor, very close to the fire, so as to
  6089	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsee to darn, for there was no other light in the nursery; and while she
  6090	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tsat darning she heard a crow. Then the window blew open as of old, and
  6091	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPeter dropped in on the floor.
  6092	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6093	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe was exactly the same as ever, and Wendy saw at once that he still had
  6094	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tall his first teeth.
  6095	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6096	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tHe was a little boy, and she was grown up. She huddled by the fire not
  6097	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdaring to move, helpless and guilty, a big woman.
  6098	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6099	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Hullo, Wendy,” he said, not noticing any difference, for he was
  6100	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthinking chiefly of himself; and in the dim light her white dress might
  6101	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\thave been the nightgown in which he had seen her first.
  6102	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6103	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Hullo, Peter,” she replied faintly, squeezing herself as small as
  6104	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tpossible. Something inside her was crying “Woman, Woman, let go of me.”
  6105	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6106	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Hullo, where is John?” he asked, suddenly missing the third bed.
  6107	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6108	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“John is not here now,” she gasped.
  6109	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6110	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Is Michael asleep?” he asked, with a careless glance at Jane.
  6111	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6112	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Yes,” she answered; and now she felt that she was untrue to Jane as
  6113	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twell as to Peter.
  6114	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6115	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“That is not Michael,” she said quickly, lest a judgment should fall on
  6116	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ther.
  6117	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6118	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPeter looked. “Hullo, is it a new one?”
  6119	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6120	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Yes.”
  6121	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6122	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Boy or girl?”
  6123	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6124	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Girl.”
  6125	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6126	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNow surely he would understand; but not a bit of it.
  6127	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6128	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Peter,” she said, faltering, “are you expecting me to fly away with
  6129	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tyou?”
  6130	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6131	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Of course; that is why I have come.” He added a little sternly, “Have
  6132	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tyou forgotten that this is spring cleaning time?”
  6133	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6134	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tShe knew it was useless to say that he had let many spring cleaning
  6135	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttimes pass.
  6136	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6137	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I can’t come,” she said apologetically, “I have forgotten how to fly.”
  6138	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6139	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I’ll soon teach you again.”
  6140	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6141	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“O Peter, don’t waste the fairy dust on me.”
  6142	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6143	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tShe had risen; and now at last a fear assailed him. “What is it?” he
  6144	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcried, shrinking.
  6145	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6146	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I will turn up the light,” she said, “and then you can see for
  6147	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tyourself.”
  6148	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6149	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tFor almost the only time in his life that I know of, Peter was afraid.
  6150	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Don’t turn up the light,” he cried.
  6151	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6152	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tShe let her hands play in the hair of the tragic boy. She was not a
  6153	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tlittle girl heart-broken about him; she was a grown woman smiling at it
  6154	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tall, but they were wet-eyed smiles.
  6155	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6156	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tThen she turned up the light, and Peter saw. He gave a cry of pain; and
  6157	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twhen the tall beautiful creature stooped to lift him in her arms he drew
  6158	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tback sharply.
  6159	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6160	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“What is it?” he cried again.
  6161	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6162	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tShe had to tell him.
  6163	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6164	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I am old, Peter. I am ever so much more than twenty. I grew up long
  6165	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tago.”
  6166	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6167	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“You promised not to!”
  6168	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6169	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I couldn’t help it. I am a married woman, Peter.”
  6170	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6171	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“No, you’re not.”
  6172	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6173	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Yes, and the little girl in the bed is my baby.”
  6174	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6175	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“No, she’s not.”
  6176	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6177	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tBut he supposed she was; and he took a step towards the sleeping child
  6178	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\twith his dagger upraised. Of course he did not strike. He sat down on
  6179	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthe floor instead and sobbed; and Wendy did not know how to comfort him,
  6180	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tthough she could have done it so easily once. She was only a woman now,
  6181	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand she ran out of the room to try to think.
  6182	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6183	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPeter continued to cry, and soon his sobs woke Jane. She sat up in bed,
  6184	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tand was interested at once.
  6185	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6186	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Boy,” she said, “why are you crying?”
  6187	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6188	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tPeter rose and bowed to her, and she bowed to him from the bed.
  6189	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6190	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Hullo,” he said.
  6191	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6192	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Hullo,” said Jane.
  6193	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6194	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“My name is Peter Pan,” he told her.
  6195	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6196	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Yes, I know.”
  6197	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6198	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“I came back for my mother,” he explained, “to take her to the
  6199	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tNeverland.”
  6200	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6201	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Yes, I know,” Jane said, “I have been waiting for you.”
  6202	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6203	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWhen Wendy returned diffidently she found Peter sitting on the bed-post
  6204	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcrowing gloriously, while Jane in her nighty was flying round the room
  6205	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tin solemn ecstasy.
  6206	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6207	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“She is my mother,” Peter explained; and Jane descended and stood by his
  6208	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tside, with the look in her face that he liked to see on ladies when they
  6209	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tgazed at him.
  6210	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6211	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“He does so need a mother,” Jane said.
  6212	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6213	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Yes, I know,” Wendy admitted rather forlornly; “no one knows it so well
  6214	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tas I.”
  6215	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6216	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“Good-bye,” said Peter to Wendy; and he rose in the air, and the
  6217	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tshameless Jane rose with him; it was already her easiest way of moving
  6218	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tabout.
  6219	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6220	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tWendy rushed to the window.
  6221	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6222	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“No, no,” she cried.
  6223	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6224	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“It is just for spring cleaning time,” Jane said, “he wants me always to
  6225	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdo his spring cleaning.”
  6226	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6227	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“If only I could go with you,” Wendy sighed.
  6228	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6229	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t“You see you can’t fly,” said Jane.
  6230	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6231	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tOf course in the end Wendy let them fly away together. Our last glimpse
  6232	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tof her shows her at the window, watching them receding into the sky
  6233	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tuntil they were as small as stars.
  6234	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6235	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tAs you look at Wendy, you may see her hair becoming white, and her
  6236	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tfigure little again, for all this happened long ago. Jane is now a
  6237	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcommon grown-up, with a daughter called Margaret; and every spring
  6238	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tcleaning time, except when he forgets, Peter comes for Margaret and
  6239	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\ttakes her to the Neverland, where she tells him stories about himself,
  6240	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tto which he listens eagerly. When Margaret grows up she will have a
  6241	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tdaughter, who is to be Peter’s mother in turn; and thus it will go on,
  6242	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\tso long as children are gay and innocent and heartless.
  6243	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
  6244	PeterPanbyJMBarrie.txt\t
