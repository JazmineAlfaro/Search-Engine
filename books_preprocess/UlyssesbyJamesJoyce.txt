    53	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
    54	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStately, plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of
    55	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed. A yellow dressinggown,
    56	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air. He
    57	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\theld the bowl aloft and intoned:
    58	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
    59	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Introibo ad altare Dei.
    60	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
    61	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHalted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely:
    62	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
    63	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Come up, Kinch! Come up, you fearful jesuit!
    64	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
    65	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSolemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest. He faced about
    66	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the
    67	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tawaking mountains. Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent
    68	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttowards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat
    69	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand shaking his head. Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned
    70	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking
    71	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light
    72	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tuntonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak.
    73	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
    74	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBuck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the
    75	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbowl smartly.
    76	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
    77	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Back to barracks! he said sternly.
    78	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
    79	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe added in a preacher’s tone:
    80	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
    81	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—For this, O dearly beloved, is the genuine Christine: body and soul and
    82	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblood and ouns. Slow music, please. Shut your eyes, gents. One moment. A
    83	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlittle trouble about those white corpuscles. Silence, all.
    84	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
    85	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused
    86	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tawhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and there
    87	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith gold points. Chrysostomos. Two strong shrill whistles answered
    88	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthrough the calm.
    89	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
    90	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Thanks, old chap, he cried briskly. That will do nicely. Switch off the
    91	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcurrent, will you?
    92	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
    93	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher, gathering
    94	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabout his legs the loose folds of his gown. The plump shadowed face and
    95	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsullen oval jowl recalled a prelate, patron of arts in the middle ages.
    96	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips.
    97	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
    98	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The mockery of it! he said gaily. Your absurd name, an ancient Greek!
    99	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   100	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet,
   101	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlaughing to himself. Stephen Dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily
   102	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thalfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as
   103	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and
   104	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlathered cheeks and neck.
   105	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   106	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBuck Mulligan’s gay voice went on.
   107	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   108	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—My name is absurd too: Malachi Mulligan, two dactyls. But it has a
   109	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHellenic ring, hasn’t it? Tripping and sunny like the buck himself.
   110	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWe must go to Athens. Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out
   111	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttwenty quid?
   112	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   113	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried:
   114	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   115	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Will he come? The jejune jesuit!
   116	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   117	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCeasing, he began to shave with care.
   118	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   119	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Tell me, Mulligan, Stephen said quietly.
   120	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   121	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, my love?
   122	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   123	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—How long is Haines going to stay in this tower?
   124	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   125	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBuck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder.
   126	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   127	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—God, isn’t he dreadful? he said frankly. A ponderous Saxon. He thinks
   128	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou’re not a gentleman. God, these bloody English! Bursting with money
   129	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand indigestion. Because he comes from Oxford. You know, Dedalus, you
   130	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thave the real Oxford manner. He can’t make you out. O, my name for you
   131	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tis the best: Kinch, the knife-blade.
   132	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   133	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe shaved warily over his chin.
   134	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   135	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—He was raving all night about a black panther, Stephen said. Where is
   136	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this guncase?
   137	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   138	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—A woful lunatic! Mulligan said. Were you in a funk?
   139	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   140	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I was, Stephen said with energy and growing fear. Out here in the dark
   141	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith a man I don’t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a
   142	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblack panther. You saved men from drowning. I’m not a hero, however. If
   143	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the stays on here I am off.
   144	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   145	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBuck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade. He hopped down
   146	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily.
   147	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   148	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Scutter! he cried thickly.
   149	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   150	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into Stephen’s upper
   151	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpocket, said:
   152	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   153	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor.
   154	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   155	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a
   156	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdirty crumpled handkerchief. Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly.
   157	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThen, gazing over the handkerchief, he said:
   158	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   159	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The bard’s noserag! A new art colour for our Irish poets: snotgreen.
   160	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tYou can almost taste it, can’t you?
   161	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   162	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair
   163	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\toakpale hair stirring slightly.
   164	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   165	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—God! he said quietly. Isn’t the sea what Algy calls it: a great sweet
   166	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmother? The snotgreen sea. The scrotumtightening sea. Epi oinopa ponton.
   167	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAh, Dedalus, the Greeks! I must teach you. You must read them in the
   168	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\toriginal. Thalatta! Thalatta! She is our great sweet mother. Come and
   169	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlook.
   170	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   171	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen stood up and went over to the parapet. Leaning on it he looked
   172	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdown on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of
   173	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKingstown.
   174	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   175	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Our mighty mother! Buck Mulligan said.
   176	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   177	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen’s
   178	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tface.
   179	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   180	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said. That’s why she won’t
   181	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlet me have anything to do with you.
   182	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   183	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily.
   184	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   185	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother asked
   186	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou, Buck Mulligan said. I’m hyperborean as much as you. But to think of
   187	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyour mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for
   188	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther. And you refused. There is something sinister in you....
   189	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   190	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek. A tolerant
   191	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsmile curled his lips.
   192	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   193	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—But a lovely mummer! he murmured to himself. Kinch, the loveliest
   194	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmummer of them all!
   195	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   196	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe shaved evenly and with care, in silence, seriously.
   197	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   198	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen, an elbow rested on the jagged granite, leaned his palm against
   199	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat-sleeve.
   200	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPain, that was not yet the pain of love, fretted his heart. Silently, in
   201	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta dream she had come to him after her death, her wasted body within its
   202	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tloose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her
   203	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbreath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faint odour of
   204	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twetted ashes. Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a
   205	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgreat sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him. The ring of bay
   206	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand skyline held a dull green mass of liquid. A bowl of white china had
   207	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had
   208	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttorn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting.
   209	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   210	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBuck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade.
   211	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   212	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ah, poor dogsbody! he said in a kind voice. I must give you a shirt and
   213	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta few noserags. How are the secondhand breeks?
   214	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   215	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—They fit well enough, Stephen answered.
   216	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   217	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBuck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip.
   218	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   219	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The mockery of it, he said contentedly. Secondleg they should be. God
   220	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknows what poxy bowsy left them off. I have a lovely pair with a hair
   221	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstripe, grey. You’ll look spiffing in them. I’m not joking, Kinch. You
   222	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlook damn well when you’re dressed.
   223	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   224	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Thanks, Stephen said. I can’t wear them if they are grey.
   225	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   226	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—He can’t wear them, Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror.
   227	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEtiquette is etiquette. He kills his mother but he can’t wear grey
   228	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttrousers.
   229	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   230	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the
   231	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsmooth skin.
   232	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   233	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its
   234	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsmokeblue mobile eyes.
   235	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   236	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That fellow I was with in the Ship last night, said Buck Mulligan, says
   237	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou have g. p. i. He’s up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman. General
   238	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tparalysis of the insane!
   239	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   240	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad
   241	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin sunlight now radiant on the sea. His curling shaven lips laughed and
   242	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe edges of his white glittering teeth. Laughter seized all his strong
   243	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twellknit trunk.
   244	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   245	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard!
   246	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   247	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft by
   248	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta crooked crack. Hair on end. As he and others see me. Who chose this
   249	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tface for me? This dogsbody to rid of vermin. It asks me too.
   250	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   251	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I pinched it out of the skivvy’s room, Buck Mulligan said. It does her
   252	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall right. The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi. Lead
   253	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim not into temptation. And her name is Ursula.
   254	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   255	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLaughing again, he brought the mirror away from Stephen’s peering eyes.
   256	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   257	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said. If
   258	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWilde were only alive to see you!
   259	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   260	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDrawing back and pointing, Stephen said with bitterness:
   261	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   262	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—It is a symbol of Irish art. The cracked lookingglass of a servant.
   263	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   264	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBuck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen’s and walked with him
   265	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tround the tower, his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he
   266	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad thrust them.
   267	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   268	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—It’s not fair to tease you like that, Kinch, is it? he said kindly. God
   269	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknows you have more spirit than any of them.
   270	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   271	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tParried again. He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his. The
   272	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcold steel pen.
   273	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   274	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Cracked lookingglass of a servant! Tell that to the oxy chap downstairs
   275	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand touch him for a guinea. He’s stinking with money and thinks you’re
   276	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnot a gentleman. His old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to Zulus
   277	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tor some bloody swindle or other. God, Kinch, if you and I could only
   278	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twork together we might do something for the island. Hellenise it.
   279	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   280	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCranly’s arm. His arm.
   281	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   282	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And to think of your having to beg from these swine. I’m the only one
   283	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat knows what you are. Why don’t you trust me more? What have you
   284	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tup your nose against me? Is it Haines? If he makes any noise here I’ll
   285	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbring down Seymour and we’ll give him a ragging worse than they gave
   286	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tClive Kempthorpe.
   287	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   288	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tYoung shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe’s rooms. Palefaces:
   289	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey hold their ribs with laughter, one clasping another. O, I shall
   290	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\texpire! Break the news to her gently, Aubrey! I shall die! With slit
   291	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the
   292	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttable, with trousers down at heels, chased by Ades of Magdalen with the
   293	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttailor’s shears. A scared calf’s face gilded with marmalade. I don’t
   294	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twant to be debagged! Don’t you play the giddy ox with me!
   295	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   296	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShouts from the open window startling evening in the quadrangle. A deaf
   297	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgardener, aproned, masked with Matthew Arnold’s face, pushes his mower
   298	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms.
   299	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   300	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTo ourselves... new paganism... omphalos.
   301	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   302	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Let him stay, Stephen said. There’s nothing wrong with him except at
   303	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnight.
   304	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   305	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Then what is it? Buck Mulligan asked impatiently. Cough it up. I’m
   306	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tquite frank with you. What have you against me now?
   307	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   308	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey halted, looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on the
   309	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twater like the snout of a sleeping whale. Stephen freed his arm quietly.
   310	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   311	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Do you wish me to tell you? he asked.
   312	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   313	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, what is it? Buck Mulligan answered. I don’t remember anything.
   314	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   315	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe looked in Stephen’s face as he spoke. A light wind passed his brow,
   316	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of
   317	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanxiety in his eyes.
   318	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   319	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen, depressed by his own voice, said:
   320	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   321	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother’s
   322	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdeath?
   323	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   324	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBuck Mulligan frowned quickly and said:
   325	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   326	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What? Where? I can’t remember anything. I remember only ideas and
   327	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsensations. Why? What happened in the name of God?
   328	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   329	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You were making tea, Stephen said, and went across the landing to
   330	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tget more hot water. Your mother and some visitor came out of the
   331	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdrawingroom. She asked you who was in your room.
   332	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   333	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes? Buck Mulligan said. What did I say? I forget.
   334	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   335	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You said, Stephen answered, O, it’s only Dedalus whose mother is
   336	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeastly dead.
   337	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   338	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck
   339	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMulligan’s cheek.
   340	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   341	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Did I say that? he asked. Well? What harm is that?
   342	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   343	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe shook his constraint from him nervously.
   344	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   345	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And what is death, he asked, your mother’s or yours or my own? You
   346	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaw only your mother die. I see them pop off every day in the Mater and
   347	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRichmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom. It’s a beastly
   348	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthing and nothing else. It simply doesn’t matter. You wouldn’t kneel
   349	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdown to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you. Why?
   350	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBecause you have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only it’s injected the
   351	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twrong way. To me it’s all a mockery and beastly. Her cerebral lobes
   352	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tare not functioning. She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks
   353	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbuttercups off the quilt. Humour her till it’s over. You crossed her
   354	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlast wish in death and yet you sulk with me because I don’t whinge like
   355	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsome hired mute from Lalouette’s. Absurd! I suppose I did say it. I
   356	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdidn’t mean to offend the memory of your mother.
   357	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   358	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe had spoken himself into boldness. Stephen, shielding the gaping
   359	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twounds which the words had left in his heart, said very coldly:
   360	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   361	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I am not thinking of the offence to my mother.
   362	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   363	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Of what then? Buck Mulligan asked.
   364	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   365	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Of the offence to me, Stephen answered.
   366	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   367	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBuck Mulligan swung round on his heel.
   368	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   369	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O, an impossible person! he exclaimed.
   370	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   371	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe walked off quickly round the parapet. Stephen stood at his post,
   372	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgazing over the calm sea towards the headland. Sea and headland now grew
   373	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdim. Pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and he felt
   374	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe fever of his cheeks.
   375	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   376	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA voice within the tower called loudly:
   377	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   378	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Are you up there, Mulligan?
   379	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   380	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I’m coming, Buck Mulligan answered.
   381	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   382	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe turned towards Stephen and said:
   383	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   384	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Look at the sea. What does it care about offences? Chuck Loyola, Kinch,
   385	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand come on down. The Sassenach wants his morning rashers.
   386	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   387	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase, level
   388	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith the roof:
   389	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   390	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Don’t mope over it all day, he said. I’m inconsequent. Give up the
   391	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmoody brooding.
   392	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   393	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of
   394	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe stairhead:
   395	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   396	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     And no more turn aside and brood
   397	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     Upon love’s bitter mystery
   398	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     For Fergus rules the brazen cars.
   399	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   400	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWoodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the
   401	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstairhead seaward where he gazed. Inshore and farther out the mirror of
   402	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twater whitened, spurned by lightshod hurrying feet. White breast of
   403	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe dim sea. The twining stresses, two by two. A hand plucking the
   404	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tharpstrings, merging their twining chords. Wavewhite wedded words
   405	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshimmering on the dim tide.
   406	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   407	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly, shadowing the bay in
   408	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdeeper green. It lay beneath him, a bowl of bitter waters. Fergus’ song:
   409	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI sang it alone in the house, holding down the long dark chords. Her
   410	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdoor was open: she wanted to hear my music. Silent with awe and pity
   411	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI went to her bedside. She was crying in her wretched bed. For those
   412	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twords, Stephen: love’s bitter mystery.
   413	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   414	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhere now?
   415	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   416	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHer secrets: old featherfans, tasselled dancecards, powdered with musk,
   417	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer. A birdcage hung in the sunny
   418	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twindow of her house when she was a girl. She heard old Royce sing in the
   419	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpantomime of Turko the Terrible and laughed with others when he sang:
   420	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   421	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     I am the boy
   422	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     That can enjoy
   423	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     Invisibility.
   424	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   425	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPhantasmal mirth, folded away: muskperfumed.
   426	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   427	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd no more turn aside and brood.
   428	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   429	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFolded away in the memory of nature with her toys. Memories beset his
   430	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrooding brain. Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had
   431	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tapproached the sacrament. A cored apple, filled with brown sugar,
   432	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\troasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening. Her shapely
   433	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children’s
   434	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshirts.
   435	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   436	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIn a dream, silently, she had come to him, her wasted body within its
   437	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tloose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her breath,
   438	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbent over him with mute secret words, a faint odour of wetted ashes.
   439	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   440	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHer glazing eyes, staring out of death, to shake and bend my soul. On me
   441	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\talone. The ghostcandle to light her agony. Ghostly light on the tortured
   442	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tface. Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror, while all prayed on
   443	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir knees. Her eyes on me to strike me down. Liliata rutilantium te
   444	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconfessorum turma circumdet: iubilantium te virginum chorus excipiat.
   445	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   446	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGhoul! Chewer of corpses!
   447	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   448	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNo, mother! Let me be and let me live.
   449	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   450	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Kinch ahoy!
   451	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   452	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBuck Mulligan’s voice sang from within the tower. It came nearer up the
   453	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstaircase, calling again. Stephen, still trembling at his soul’s cry,
   454	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\theard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words.
   455	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   456	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Dedalus, come down, like a good mosey. Breakfast is ready. Haines is
   457	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tapologising for waking us last night. It’s all right.
   458	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   459	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I’m coming, Stephen said, turning.
   460	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   461	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Do, for Jesus’ sake, Buck Mulligan said. For my sake and for all our
   462	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsakes.
   463	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   464	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis head disappeared and reappeared.
   465	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   466	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I told him your symbol of Irish art. He says it’s very clever. Touch
   467	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim for a quid, will you? A guinea, I mean.
   468	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   469	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I get paid this morning, Stephen said.
   470	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   471	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The school kip? Buck Mulligan said. How much? Four quid? Lend us one.
   472	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   473	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—If you want it, Stephen said.
   474	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   475	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Four shining sovereigns, Buck Mulligan cried with delight. We’ll have
   476	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids. Four omnipotent
   477	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsovereigns.
   478	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   479	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out of
   480	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttune with a Cockney accent:
   481	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   482	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     O, won’t we have a merry time,
   483	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     Drinking whisky, beer and wine!
   484	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     On coronation,
   485	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     Coronation day!
   486	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     O, won’t we have a merry time
   487	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     On coronation day!
   488	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   489	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWarm sunshine merrying over the sea. The nickel shavingbowl shone,
   490	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tforgotten, on the parapet. Why should I bring it down? Or leave it there
   491	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall day, forgotten friendship?
   492	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   493	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness,
   494	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsmelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck.
   495	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSo I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes. I am another now and
   496	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyet the same. A servant too. A server of a servant.
   497	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   498	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIn the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan’s gowned form
   499	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmoved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its
   500	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyellow glow. Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor
   501	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of
   502	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcoalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning.
   503	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   504	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—We’ll be choked, Buck Mulligan said. Haines, open that door, will you?
   505	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   506	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker. A tall figure rose from the
   507	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pulled open
   508	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe inner doors.
   509	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   510	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Have you the key? a voice asked.
   511	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   512	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Dedalus has it, Buck Mulligan said. Janey Mack, I’m choked!
   513	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   514	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe howled, without looking up from the fire:
   515	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   516	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Kinch!
   517	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   518	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—It’s in the lock, Stephen said, coming forward.
   519	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   520	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been
   521	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tset ajar, welcome light and bright air entered. Haines stood at the
   522	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdoorway, looking out. Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and
   523	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsat down to wait. Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside
   524	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim. Then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set
   525	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem down heavily and sighed with relief.
   526	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   527	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I’m melting, he said, as the candle remarked when... But, hush! Not a
   528	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tword more on that subject! Kinch, wake up! Bread, butter, honey. Haines,
   529	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcome in. The grub is ready. Bless us, O Lord, and these thy gifts.
   530	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhere’s the sugar? O, jay, there’s no milk.
   531	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   532	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from
   533	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe locker. Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet.
   534	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   535	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What sort of a kip is this? he said. I told her to come after eight.
   536	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   537	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—We can drink it black, Stephen said thirstily. There’s a lemon in the
   538	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlocker.
   539	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   540	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O, damn you and your Paris fads! Buck Mulligan said. I want Sandycove
   541	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmilk.
   542	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   543	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHaines came in from the doorway and said quietly:
   544	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   545	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That woman is coming up with the milk.
   546	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   547	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The blessings of God on you! Buck Mulligan cried, jumping up from his
   548	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchair. Sit down. Pour out the tea there. The sugar is in the bag. Here,
   549	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI can’t go fumbling at the damned eggs.
   550	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   551	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three
   552	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplates, saying:
   553	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   554	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti.
   555	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   556	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHaines sat down to pour out the tea.
   557	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   558	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I’m giving you two lumps each, he said. But, I say, Mulligan, you do
   559	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmake strong tea, don’t you?
   560	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   561	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBuck Mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old woman’s
   562	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twheedling voice:
   563	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   564	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—When I makes tea I makes tea, as old mother Grogan said. And when I
   565	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmakes water I makes water.
   566	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   567	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—By Jove, it is tea, Haines said.
   568	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   569	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBuck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling:
   570	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   571	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—So I do, Mrs Cahill, says she. Begob, ma’am, says Mrs Cahill, God send
   572	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou don’t make them in the one pot.
   573	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   574	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled
   575	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton his knife.
   576	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   577	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That’s folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, Haines. Five
   578	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of
   579	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDundrum. Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind.
   580	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   581	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice, lifting his
   582	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrows:
   583	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   584	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan’s tea and water pot spoken of
   585	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads?
   586	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   587	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I doubt it, said Stephen gravely.
   588	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   589	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Do you now? Buck Mulligan said in the same tone. Your reasons, pray?
   590	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   591	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the
   592	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMabinogion. Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann.
   593	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   594	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBuck Mulligan’s face smiled with delight.
   595	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   596	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Charming! he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth and
   597	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblinking his eyes pleasantly. Do you think she was? Quite charming!
   598	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   599	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThen, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened
   600	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf:
   601	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   602	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     —For old Mary Ann
   603	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     She doesn’t care a damn.
   604	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     But, hising up her petticoats...
   605	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   606	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned.
   607	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   608	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe doorway was darkened by an entering form.
   609	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   610	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The milk, sir!
   611	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   612	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Come in, ma’am, Mulligan said. Kinch, get the jug.
   613	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   614	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAn old woman came forward and stood by Stephen’s elbow.
   615	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   616	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That’s a lovely morning, sir, she said. Glory be to God.
   617	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   618	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—To whom? Mulligan said, glancing at her. Ah, to be sure!
   619	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   620	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker.
   621	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   622	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The islanders, Mulligan said to Haines casually, speak frequently of
   623	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe collector of prepuces.
   624	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   625	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—How much, sir? asked the old woman.
   626	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   627	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—A quart, Stephen said.
   628	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   629	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white
   630	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmilk, not hers. Old shrunken paps. She poured again a measureful and
   631	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta tilly. Old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe
   632	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta messenger. She praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out.
   633	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCrouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on her
   634	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttoadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs. They lowed
   635	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabout her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle. Silk of the kine and poor old
   636	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twoman, names given her in old times. A wandering crone, lowly form of
   637	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tan immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their common
   638	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning. To serve or to upbraid,
   639	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour.
   640	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   641	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—It is indeed, ma’am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups.
   642	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   643	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Taste it, sir, she said.
   644	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   645	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe drank at her bidding.
   646	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   647	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat
   648	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tloudly, we wouldn’t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten
   649	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tguts. Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved with
   650	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdust, horsedung and consumptives’ spits.
   651	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   652	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Are you a medical student, sir? the old woman asked.
   653	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   654	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I am, ma’am, Buck Mulligan answered.
   655	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   656	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Look at that now, she said.
   657	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   658	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen listened in scornful silence. She bows her old head to a voice
   659	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me she
   660	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tslights. To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there
   661	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tis of her but her woman’s unclean loins, of man’s flesh made not in
   662	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGod’s likeness, the serpent’s prey. And to the loud voice that now bids
   663	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther be silent with wondering unsteady eyes.
   664	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   665	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Do you understand what he says? Stephen asked her.
   666	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   667	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Is it French you are talking, sir? the old woman said to Haines.
   668	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   669	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHaines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently.
   670	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   671	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Irish, Buck Mulligan said. Is there Gaelic on you?
   672	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   673	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it. Are you from the
   674	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twest, sir?
   675	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   676	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I am an Englishman, Haines answered.
   677	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   678	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—He’s English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak Irish
   679	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin Ireland.
   680	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   681	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I’m ashamed I don’t speak the
   682	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlanguage myself. I’m told it’s a grand language by them that knows.
   683	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   684	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan. Wonderful entirely. Fill
   685	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tus out some more tea, Kinch. Would you like a cup, ma’am?
   686	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   687	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the
   688	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmilkcan on her forearm and about to go.
   689	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   690	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHaines said to her:
   691	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   692	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Have you your bill? We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn’t we?
   693	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   694	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen filled again the three cups.
   695	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   696	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Bill, sir? she said, halting. Well, it’s seven mornings a pint at
   697	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttwopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three
   698	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling. That’s a
   699	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshilling and one and two is two and two, sir.
   700	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   701	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBuck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly
   702	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbuttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search his
   703	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttrouser pockets.
   704	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   705	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling.
   706	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   707	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the
   708	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthick rich milk. Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in
   709	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this fingers and cried:
   710	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   711	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—A miracle!
   712	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   713	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying:
   714	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   715	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ask nothing more of me, sweet. All I can give you I give.
   716	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   717	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen laid the coin in her uneager hand.
   718	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   719	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—We’ll owe twopence, he said.
   720	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   721	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin. Time enough. Good morning,
   722	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsir.
   723	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   724	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligan’s tender chant:
   725	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   726	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     —Heart of my heart, were it more,
   727	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     More would be laid at your feet.
   728	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   729	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe turned to Stephen and said:
   730	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   731	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Seriously, Dedalus. I’m stony. Hurry out to your school kip and bring
   732	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tus back some money. Today the bards must drink and junket. Ireland
   733	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\texpects that every man this day will do his duty.
   734	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   735	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit your
   736	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnational library today.
   737	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   738	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said.
   739	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   740	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe turned to Stephen and asked blandly:
   741	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   742	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch?
   743	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   744	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThen he said to Haines:
   745	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   746	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month.
   747	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   748	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honey
   749	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttrickle over a slice of the loaf.
   750	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   751	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHaines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the
   752	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tloose collar of his tennis shirt spoke:
   753	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   754	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me.
   755	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   756	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSpeaking to me. They wash and tub and scrub. Agenbite of inwit.
   757	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tConscience. Yet here’s a spot.
   758	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   759	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol
   760	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof Irish art is deuced good.
   761	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   762	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBuck Mulligan kicked Stephen’s foot under the table and said with warmth
   763	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof tone:
   764	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   765	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines.
   766	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   767	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen. I was just
   768	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthinking of it when that poor old creature came in.
   769	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   770	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Would I make any money by it? Stephen asked.
   771	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   772	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHaines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of
   773	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe hammock, said:
   774	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   775	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I don’t know, I’m sure.
   776	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   777	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe strolled out to the doorway. Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen and
   778	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaid with coarse vigour:
   779	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   780	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You put your hoof in it now. What did you say that for?
   781	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   782	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Well? Stephen said. The problem is to get money. From whom? From the
   783	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmilkwoman or from him. It’s a toss up, I think.
   784	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   785	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come along
   786	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes.
   787	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   788	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him.
   789	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   790	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBuck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen’s arm.
   791	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   792	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—From me, Kinch, he said.
   793	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   794	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIn a suddenly changed tone he added:
   795	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   796	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—To tell you the God’s truth I think you’re right. Damn all else they
   797	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tare good for. Why don’t you play them as I do? To hell with them all.
   798	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLet us get out of the kip.
   799	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   800	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying
   801	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tresignedly:
   802	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   803	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Mulligan is stripped of his garments.
   804	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   805	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe emptied his pockets on to the table.
   806	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   807	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—There’s your snotrag, he said.
   808	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   809	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them,
   810	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchiding them, and to his dangling watchchain. His hands plunged and
   811	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief. God,
   812	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twe’ll simply have to dress the character. I want puce gloves and
   813	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgreen boots. Contradiction. Do I contradict myself? Very well then, I
   814	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcontradict myself. Mercurial Malachi. A limp black missile flew out of
   815	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this talking hands.
   816	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   817	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And there’s your Latin quarter hat, he said.
   818	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   819	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen picked it up and put it on. Haines called to them from the
   820	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdoorway:
   821	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   822	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Are you coming, you fellows?
   823	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   824	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I’m ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door. Come out,
   825	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKinch. You have eaten all we left, I suppose. Resigned he passed out
   826	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow:
   827	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   828	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And going forth he met Butterly.
   829	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   830	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out
   831	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and
   832	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlocked it. He put the huge key in his inner pocket.
   833	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   834	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAt the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked:
   835	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   836	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Did you bring the key?
   837	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   838	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I have it, Stephen said, preceding them.
   839	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   840	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe walked on. Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy
   841	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses.
   842	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   843	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Down, sir! How dare you, sir!
   844	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   845	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHaines asked:
   846	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   847	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Do you pay rent for this tower?
   848	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   849	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Twelve quid, Buck Mulligan said.
   850	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   851	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder.
   852	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   853	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last:
   854	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   855	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say. Martello you call it?
   856	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   857	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were on
   858	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe sea. But ours is the omphalos.
   859	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   860	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What is your idea of Hamlet? Haines asked Stephen.
   861	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   862	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain. I’m not equal to Thomas Aquinas
   863	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up. Wait till I
   864	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thave a few pints in me first.
   865	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   866	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe turned to Stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his
   867	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprimrose waistcoat:
   868	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   869	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You couldn’t manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you?
   870	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   871	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—It has waited so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer.
   872	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   873	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably. Is it some paradox?
   874	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   875	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Pooh! Buck Mulligan said. We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes.
   876	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIt’s quite simple. He proves by algebra that Hamlet’s grandson is
   877	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShakespeare’s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own
   878	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfather.
   879	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   880	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What? Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen. He himself?
   881	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   882	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBuck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in
   883	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tloose laughter, said to Stephen’s ear:
   884	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   885	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O, shade of Kinch the elder! Japhet in search of a father!
   886	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   887	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—We’re always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines. And it is
   888	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trather long to tell.
   889	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   890	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBuck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands.
   891	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   892	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said.
   893	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   894	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this tower
   895	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore. That beetles o’er
   896	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this base into the sea, isn’t it?
   897	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   898	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBuck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did not
   899	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspeak. In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in cheap
   900	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdusty mourning between their gay attires.
   901	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   902	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—It’s a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again.
   903	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   904	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent.
   905	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe seas’ ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the
   906	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsmokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail
   907	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttacking by the Muglins.
   908	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   909	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused.
   910	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe Father and the Son idea. The Son striving to be atoned with the
   911	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFather.
   912	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   913	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBuck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face. He looked
   914	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had
   915	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety. He moved
   916	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta doll’s head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and
   917	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbegan to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice:
   918	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   919	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     —I’m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard.
   920	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     My mother’s a jew, my father’s a bird.
   921	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree.
   922	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     So here’s to disciples and Calvary.
   923	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   924	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe held up a forefinger of warning.
   925	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   926	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     —If anyone thinks that I amn’t divine
   927	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     He’ll get no free drinks when I’m making the wine
   928	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     But have to drink water and wish it were plain
   929	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     That I make when the wine becomes water again.
   930	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   931	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe tugged swiftly at Stephen’s ashplant in farewell and, running forward
   932	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or
   933	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted:
   934	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   935	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     —Goodbye, now, goodbye! Write down all I said
   936	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     And tell Tom, Dick and Harry I rose from the dead.
   937	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     What’s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly
   938	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     And Olivet’s breezy... Goodbye, now, goodbye!
   939	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   940	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole, fluttering his
   941	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twinglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercury’s hat quivering in the fresh
   942	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries.
   943	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   944	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHaines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephen and
   945	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaid:
   946	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   947	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—We oughtn’t to laugh, I suppose. He’s rather blasphemous. I’m not a
   948	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeliever myself, that is to say. Still his gaiety takes the harm out of
   949	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit somehow, doesn’t it? What did he call it? Joseph the Joiner?
   950	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   951	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered.
   952	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   953	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O, Haines said, you have heard it before?
   954	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   955	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily.
   956	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   957	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You’re not a believer, are you? Haines asked. I mean, a believer in
   958	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe narrow sense of the word. Creation from nothing and miracles and a
   959	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpersonal God.
   960	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   961	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—There’s only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said.
   962	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   963	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHaines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a
   964	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgreen stone. He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it.
   965	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   966	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette.
   967	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   968	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHaines helped himself and snapped the case to. He put it back in his
   969	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang
   970	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit open too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk
   971	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttowards Stephen in the shell of his hands.
   972	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   973	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again. Either you believe
   974	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tor you don’t, isn’t it? Personally I couldn’t stomach that idea of a
   975	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpersonal God. You don’t stand for that, I suppose?
   976	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   977	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible
   978	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\texample of free thought.
   979	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   980	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by his
   981	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tside. Its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels.
   982	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMy familiar, after me, calling, Steeeeeeeeeeeephen! A wavering line
   983	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\talong the path. They will walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark.
   984	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe wants that key. It is mine. I paid the rent. Now I eat his salt
   985	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbread. Give him the key too. All. He will ask for it. That was in his
   986	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\teyes.
   987	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   988	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—After all, Haines began...
   989	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   990	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not
   991	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall unkind.
   992	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   993	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—After all, I should think you are able to free yourself. You are your
   994	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\town master, it seems to me.
   995	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   996	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I am a servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an Italian.
   997	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
   998	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Italian? Haines said.
   999	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1000	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA crazy queen, old and jealous. Kneel down before me.
  1001	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1002	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs.
  1003	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1004	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Italian? Haines said again. What do you mean?
  1005	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1006	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The imperial British state, Stephen answered, his colour rising, and
  1007	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe holy Roman catholic and apostolic church.
  1008	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1009	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHaines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he
  1010	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspoke.
  1011	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1012	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I can quite understand that, he said calmly. An Irishman must think
  1013	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlike that, I daresay. We feel in England that we have treated you rather
  1014	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunfairly. It seems history is to blame.
  1015	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1016	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe proud potent titles clanged over Stephen’s memory the triumph of
  1017	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir brazen bells: et unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam:
  1018	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts,
  1019	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta chemistry of stars. Symbol of the apostles in the mass for pope
  1020	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMarcellus, the voices blended, singing alone loud in affirmation: and
  1021	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbehind their chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed
  1022	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand menaced her heresiarchs. A horde of heresies fleeing with mitres
  1023	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tawry: Photius and the brood of mockers of whom Mulligan was one, and
  1024	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tArius, warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the Son
  1025	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith the Father, and Valentine, spurning Christ’s terrene body, and the
  1026	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsubtle African heresiarch Sabellius who held that the Father was Himself
  1027	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis own Son. Words Mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the
  1028	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstranger. Idle mockery. The void awaits surely all them that weave the
  1029	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twind: a menace, a disarming and a worsting from those embattled angels
  1030	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the church, Michael’s host, who defend her ever in the hour of
  1031	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconflict with their lances and their shields.
  1032	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1033	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHear, hear! Prolonged applause. Zut! Nom de Dieu!
  1034	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1035	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Of course I’m a Britisher, Haines’s voice said, and I feel as one. I
  1036	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdon’t want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either.
  1037	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThat’s our national problem, I’m afraid, just now.
  1038	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1039	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTwo men stood at the verge of the cliff, watching: businessman, boatman.
  1040	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1041	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—She’s making for Bullock harbour.
  1042	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1043	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain.
  1044	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1045	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—There’s five fathoms out there, he said. It’ll be swept up that way
  1046	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhen the tide comes in about one. It’s nine days today.
  1047	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1048	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe man that was drowned. A sail veering about the blank bay waiting
  1049	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor a swollen bundle to bob up, roll over to the sun a puffy face,
  1050	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaltwhite. Here I am.
  1051	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1052	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey followed the winding path down to the creek. Buck Mulligan stood on
  1053	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder.
  1054	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowly frogwise
  1055	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this green legs in the deep jelly of the water.
  1056	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1057	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Is the brother with you, Malachi?
  1058	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1059	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Down in Westmeath. With the Bannons.
  1060	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1061	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Still there? I got a card from Bannon. Says he found a sweet young
  1062	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthing down there. Photo girl he calls her.
  1063	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1064	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Snapshot, eh? Brief exposure.
  1065	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1066	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBuck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots. An elderly man shot up near
  1067	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe spur of rock a blowing red face. He scrambled up by the stones,
  1068	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twater glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair, water
  1069	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black
  1070	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsagging loincloth.
  1071	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1072	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBuck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at Haines
  1073	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand Stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips
  1074	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand breastbone.
  1075	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1076	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Seymour’s back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of
  1077	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trock. Chucked medicine and going in for the army.
  1078	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1079	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ah, go to God! Buck Mulligan said.
  1080	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1081	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Going over next week to stew. You know that red Carlisle girl, Lily?
  1082	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1083	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes.
  1084	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1085	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Spooning with him last night on the pier. The father is rotto with
  1086	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmoney.
  1087	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1088	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Is she up the pole?
  1089	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1090	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Better ask Seymour that.
  1091	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1092	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Seymour a bleeding officer! Buck Mulligan said.
  1093	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1094	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying
  1095	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttritely:
  1096	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1097	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Redheaded women buck like goats.
  1098	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1099	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt.
  1100	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1101	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—My twelfth rib is gone, he cried. I’m the Übermensch. Toothless Kinch
  1102	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand I, the supermen.
  1103	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1104	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his
  1105	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tclothes lay.
  1106	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1107	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Are you going in here, Malachi?
  1108	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1109	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes. Make room in the bed.
  1110	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1111	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached
  1112	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe middle of the creek in two long clean strokes. Haines sat down on a
  1113	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstone, smoking.
  1114	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1115	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Are you not coming in? Buck Mulligan asked.
  1116	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1117	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Later on, Haines said. Not on my breakfast.
  1118	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1119	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen turned away.
  1120	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1121	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I’m going, Mulligan, he said.
  1122	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1123	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Give us that key, Kinch, Buck Mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat.
  1124	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1125	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen handed him the key. Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped
  1126	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tclothes.
  1127	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1128	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And twopence, he said, for a pint. Throw it there.
  1129	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1130	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen threw two pennies on the soft heap. Dressing, undressing. Buck
  1131	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly:
  1132	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1133	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord. Thus spake
  1134	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tZarathustra.
  1135	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1136	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis plump body plunged.
  1137	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1138	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—We’ll see you again, Haines said, turning as Stephen walked up the path
  1139	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand smiling at wild Irish.
  1140	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1141	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHorn of a bull, hoof of a horse, smile of a Saxon.
  1142	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1143	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The Ship, Buck Mulligan cried. Half twelve.
  1144	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1145	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Good, Stephen said.
  1146	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1147	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe walked along the upwardcurving path.
  1148	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1149	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     Liliata rutilantium.
  1150	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     Turma circumdet.
  1151	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     Iubilantium te virginum.
  1152	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1153	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe priest’s grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly. I will
  1154	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnot sleep here tonight. Home also I cannot go.
  1155	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1156	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA voice, sweettoned and sustained, called to him from the sea. Turning
  1157	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe curve he waved his hand. It called again. A sleek brown head, a
  1158	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseal’s, far out on the water, round.
  1159	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1160	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tUsurper.
  1161	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1162	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1163	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1164	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1165	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1166	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t[ 2 ]
  1167	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1168	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You, Cochrane, what city sent for him?
  1169	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1170	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Tarentum, sir.
  1171	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1172	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Very good. Well?
  1173	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1174	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—There was a battle, sir.
  1175	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1176	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Very good. Where?
  1177	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1178	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe boy’s blank face asked the blank window.
  1179	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1180	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFabled by the daughters of memory. And yet it was in some way if not as
  1181	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmemory fabled it. A phrase, then, of impatience, thud of Blake’s wings
  1182	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof excess. I hear the ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling
  1183	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmasonry, and time one livid final flame. What’s left us then?
  1184	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1185	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I forget the place, sir. 279 B. C.
  1186	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1187	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Asculum, Stephen said, glancing at the name and date in the gorescarred
  1188	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbook.
  1189	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1190	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, sir. And he said: Another victory like that and we are done for.
  1191	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1192	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThat phrase the world had remembered. A dull ease of the mind. From
  1193	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta hill above a corpsestrewn plain a general speaking to his officers,
  1194	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tleaned upon his spear. Any general to any officers. They lend ear.
  1195	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1196	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You, Armstrong, Stephen said. What was the end of Pyrrhus?
  1197	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1198	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—End of Pyrrhus, sir?
  1199	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1200	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I know, sir. Ask me, sir, Comyn said.
  1201	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1202	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Wait. You, Armstrong. Do you know anything about Pyrrhus?
  1203	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1204	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrong’s satchel. He curled them
  1205	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbetween his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly. Crumbs adhered to
  1206	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe tissue of his lips. A sweetened boy’s breath. Welloff people, proud
  1207	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat their eldest son was in the navy. Vico road, Dalkey.
  1208	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1209	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Pyrrhus, sir? Pyrrhus, a pier.
  1210	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1211	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAll laughed. Mirthless high malicious laughter. Armstrong looked round
  1212	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat his classmates, silly glee in profile. In a moment they will laugh
  1213	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmore loudly, aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay.
  1214	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1215	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Tell me now, Stephen said, poking the boy’s shoulder with the book,
  1216	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhat is a pier.
  1217	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1218	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—A pier, sir, Armstrong said. A thing out in the water. A kind of a
  1219	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbridge. Kingstown pier, sir.
  1220	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1221	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSome laughed again: mirthless but with meaning. Two in the back bench
  1222	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhispered. Yes. They knew: had never learned nor ever been innocent.
  1223	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAll. With envy he watched their faces: Edith, Ethel, Gerty, Lily. Their
  1224	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlikes: their breaths, too, sweetened with tea and jam, their bracelets
  1225	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttittering in the struggle.
  1226	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1227	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Kingstown pier, Stephen said. Yes, a disappointed bridge.
  1228	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1229	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe words troubled their gaze.
  1230	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1231	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—How, sir? Comyn asked. A bridge is across a river.
  1232	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1233	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFor Haines’s chapbook. No-one here to hear. Tonight deftly amid wild
  1234	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdrink and talk, to pierce the polished mail of his mind. What then? A
  1235	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjester at the court of his master, indulged and disesteemed, winning a
  1236	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tclement master’s praise. Why had they chosen all that part? Not wholly
  1237	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor the smooth caress. For them too history was a tale like any other
  1238	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttoo often heard, their land a pawnshop.
  1239	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1240	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHad Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam’s hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not
  1241	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeen knifed to death. They are not to be thought away. Time has
  1242	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbranded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite
  1243	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpossibilities they have ousted. But can those have been possible seeing
  1244	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat they never were? Or was that only possible which came to pass?
  1245	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWeave, weaver of the wind.
  1246	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1247	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Tell us a story, sir.
  1248	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1249	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O, do, sir. A ghoststory.
  1250	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1251	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Where do you begin in this? Stephen asked, opening another book.
  1252	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1253	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Weep no more, Comyn said.
  1254	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1255	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Go on then, Talbot.
  1256	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1257	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And the story, sir?
  1258	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1259	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—After, Stephen said. Go on, Talbot.
  1260	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1261	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork
  1262	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof his satchel. He recited jerks of verse with odd glances at the text:
  1263	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1264	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     —Weep no more, woful shepherds, weep no more
  1265	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead,
  1266	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor...
  1267	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1268	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIt must be a movement then, an actuality of the possible as possible.
  1269	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAristotle’s phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated
  1270	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout into the studious silence of the library of Saint Genevieve where he
  1271	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad read, sheltered from the sin of Paris, night by night. By his elbow
  1272	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta delicate Siamese conned a handbook of strategy. Fed and feeding brains
  1273	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabout me: under glowlamps, impaled, with faintly beating feelers: and
  1274	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin my mind’s darkness a sloth of the underworld, reluctant, shy of
  1275	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrightness, shifting her dragon scaly folds. Thought is the thought of
  1276	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthought. Tranquil brightness. The soul is in a manner all that is: the
  1277	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsoul is the form of forms. Tranquility sudden, vast, candescent: form of
  1278	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tforms.
  1279	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1280	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTalbot repeated:
  1281	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1282	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     —Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves,
  1283	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     Through the dear might...
  1284	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1285	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Turn over, Stephen said quietly. I don’t see anything.
  1286	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1287	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What, sir? Talbot asked simply, bending forward.
  1288	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1289	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis hand turned the page over. He leaned back and went on again, having
  1290	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjust remembered. Of him that walked the waves. Here also over these
  1291	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcraven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer’s heart and lips and
  1292	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton mine. It lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the
  1293	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttribute. To Caesar what is Caesar’s, to God what is God’s. A long
  1294	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlook from dark eyes, a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the
  1295	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchurch’s looms. Ay.
  1296	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1297	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     Riddle me, riddle me, randy ro.
  1298	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     My father gave me seeds to sow.
  1299	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1300	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTalbot slid his closed book into his satchel.
  1301	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1302	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Have I heard all? Stephen asked.
  1303	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1304	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, sir. Hockey at ten, sir.
  1305	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1306	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Half day, sir. Thursday.
  1307	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1308	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Who can answer a riddle? Stephen asked.
  1309	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1310	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey bundled their books away, pencils clacking, pages rustling.
  1311	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCrowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels, all gabbling
  1312	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgaily:
  1313	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1314	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—A riddle, sir? Ask me, sir.
  1315	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1316	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O, ask me, sir.
  1317	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1318	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—A hard one, sir.
  1319	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1320	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—This is the riddle, Stephen said:
  1321	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1322	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     The cock crew,
  1323	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     The sky was blue:
  1324	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     The bells in heaven
  1325	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     Were striking eleven.
  1326	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     ‘Tis time for this poor soul
  1327	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     To go to heaven.
  1328	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1329	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhat is that?
  1330	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1331	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What, sir?
  1332	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1333	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Again, sir. We didn’t hear.
  1334	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1335	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTheir eyes grew bigger as the lines were repeated. After a silence
  1336	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCochrane said:
  1337	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1338	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What is it, sir? We give it up.
  1339	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1340	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen, his throat itching, answered:
  1341	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1342	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush.
  1343	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1344	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries
  1345	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\techoed dismay.
  1346	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1347	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA stick struck the door and a voice in the corridor called:
  1348	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1349	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Hockey!
  1350	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1351	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey broke asunder, sidling out of their benches, leaping them. Quickly
  1352	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and
  1353	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tclamour of their boots and tongues.
  1354	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1355	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly, showing an open
  1356	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcopybook. His tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness
  1357	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading. On his
  1358	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcheek, dull and bloodless, a soft stain of ink lay, dateshaped, recent
  1359	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand damp as a snail’s bed.
  1360	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1361	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe held out his copybook. The word Sums was written on the headline.
  1362	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBeneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with
  1363	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblind loops and a blot. Cyril Sargent: his name and seal.
  1364	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1365	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again, he said, and show them to
  1366	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou, sir.
  1367	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1368	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen touched the edges of the book. Futility.
  1369	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1370	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Do you understand how to do them now? he asked.
  1371	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1372	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Numbers eleven to fifteen, Sargent answered. Mr Deasy said I was to
  1373	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcopy them off the board, sir.
  1374	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1375	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Can you do them yourself? Stephen asked.
  1376	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1377	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—No, sir.
  1378	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1379	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tUgly and futile: lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink, a
  1380	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsnail’s bed. Yet someone had loved him, borne him in her arms and in
  1381	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther heart. But for her the race of the world would have trampled him
  1382	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunderfoot, a squashed boneless snail. She had loved his weak watery
  1383	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblood drained from her own. Was that then real? The only true thing
  1384	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin life? His mother’s prostrate body the fiery Columbanus in holy zeal
  1385	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbestrode. She was no more: the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in
  1386	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe fire, an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes. She had saved him from
  1387	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeing trampled underfoot and had gone, scarcely having been. A poor soul
  1388	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgone to heaven: and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox, red reek
  1389	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof rapine in his fur, with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth,
  1390	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlistened, scraped up the earth, listened, scraped and scraped.
  1391	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1392	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem. He proves by algebra
  1393	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat Shakespeare’s ghost is Hamlet’s grandfather. Sargent peered askance
  1394	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthrough his slanted glasses. Hockeysticks rattled in the lumberroom: the
  1395	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thollow knock of a ball and calls from the field.
  1396	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1397	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAcross the page the symbols moved in grave morrice, in the mummery of
  1398	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir letters, wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes. Give hands,
  1399	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttraverse, bow to partner: so: imps of fancy of the Moors. Gone too from
  1400	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe world, Averroes and Moses Maimonides, dark men in mien and movement,
  1401	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tflashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the world, a
  1402	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdarkness shining in brightness which brightness could not comprehend.
  1403	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1404	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Do you understand now? Can you work the second for yourself?
  1405	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1406	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, sir.
  1407	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1408	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIn long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data. Waiting always for a word
  1409	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols, a faint hue
  1410	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof shame flickering behind his dull skin. Amor matris: subjective and
  1411	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tobjective genitive. With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed
  1412	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands.
  1413	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1414	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLike him was I, these sloping shoulders, this gracelessness. My
  1415	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchildhood bends beside me. Too far for me to lay a hand there once or
  1416	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlightly. Mine is far and his secret as our eyes. Secrets, silent, stony
  1417	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsit in the dark palaces of both our hearts: secrets weary of their
  1418	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttyranny: tyrants, willing to be dethroned.
  1419	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1420	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe sum was done.
  1421	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1422	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—It is very simple, Stephen said as he stood up.
  1423	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1424	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, sir. Thanks, Sargent answered.
  1425	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1426	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his
  1427	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcopybook back to his bench.
  1428	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1429	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You had better get your stick and go out to the others, Stephen said as
  1430	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the followed towards the door the boy’s graceless form.
  1431	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1432	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, sir.
  1433	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1434	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIn the corridor his name was heard, called from the playfield.
  1435	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1436	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Sargent!
  1437	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1438	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Run on, Stephen said. Mr Deasy is calling you.
  1439	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1440	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy
  1441	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfield where sharp voices were in strife. They were sorted in teams and
  1442	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet. When
  1443	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to him. He
  1444	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tturned his angry white moustache.
  1445	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1446	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What is it now? he cried continually without listening.
  1447	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1448	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side, sir, Stephen said.
  1449	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1450	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Will you wait in my study for a moment, Mr Deasy said, till I restore
  1451	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\torder here.
  1452	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1453	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man’s voice
  1454	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcried sternly:
  1455	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1456	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What is the matter? What is it now?
  1457	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1458	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTheir sharp voices cried about him on all sides: their many forms closed
  1459	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tround him, the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed head.
  1460	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1461	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather
  1462	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof its chairs. As on the first day he bargained with me here. As it was
  1463	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the beginning, is now. On the sideboard the tray of Stuart coins,
  1464	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbase treasure of a bog: and ever shall be. And snug in their spooncase
  1465	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof purple plush, faded, the twelve apostles having preached to all the
  1466	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgentiles: world without end.
  1467	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1468	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor. Blowing out his
  1469	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trare moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table.
  1470	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1471	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—First, our little financial settlement, he said.
  1472	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1473	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong. It
  1474	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tslapped open and he took from it two notes, one of joined halves, and
  1475	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlaid them carefully on the table.
  1476	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1477	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Two, he said, strapping and stowing his pocketbook away.
  1478	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1479	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd now his strongroom for the gold. Stephen’s embarrassed hand moved
  1480	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tover the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar: whelks and money
  1481	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcowries and leopard shells: and this, whorled as an emir’s turban, and
  1482	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthis, the scallop of saint James. An old pilgrim’s hoard, dead treasure,
  1483	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thollow shells.
  1484	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1485	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA sovereign fell, bright and new, on the soft pile of the tablecloth.
  1486	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1487	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Three, Mr Deasy said, turning his little savingsbox about in his hand.
  1488	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThese are handy things to have. See. This is for sovereigns. This is for
  1489	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshillings. Sixpences, halfcrowns. And here crowns. See.
  1490	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1491	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe shot from it two crowns and two shillings.
  1492	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1493	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Three twelve, he said. I think you’ll find that’s right.
  1494	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1495	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Thank you, sir, Stephen said, gathering the money together with shy
  1496	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thaste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers.
  1497	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1498	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—No thanks at all, Mr Deasy said. You have earned it.
  1499	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1500	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen’s hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells. Symbols too
  1501	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof beauty and of power. A lump in my pocket: symbols soiled by greed and
  1502	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmisery.
  1503	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1504	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Don’t carry it like that, Mr Deasy said. You’ll pull it out somewhere
  1505	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand lose it. You just buy one of these machines. You’ll find them very
  1506	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thandy.
  1507	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1508	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnswer something.
  1509	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1510	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Mine would be often empty, Stephen said.
  1511	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1512	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe same room and hour, the same wisdom: and I the same. Three times
  1513	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnow. Three nooses round me here. Well? I can break them in this instant
  1514	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tif I will.
  1515	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1516	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Because you don’t save, Mr Deasy said, pointing his finger. You don’t
  1517	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknow yet what money is. Money is power. When you have lived as long as I
  1518	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thave. I know, I know. If youth but knew. But what does Shakespeare say?
  1519	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPut but money in thy purse.
  1520	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1521	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Iago, Stephen murmured.
  1522	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1523	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man’s stare.
  1524	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1525	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—He knew what money was, Mr Deasy said. He made money. A poet, yes, but
  1526	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tan Englishman too. Do you know what is the pride of the English? Do you
  1527	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknow what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an Englishman’s
  1528	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmouth?
  1529	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1530	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe seas’ ruler. His seacold eyes looked on the empty bay: it seems
  1531	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thistory is to blame: on me and on my words, unhating.
  1532	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1533	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That on his empire, Stephen said, the sun never sets.
  1534	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1535	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ba! Mr Deasy cried. That’s not English. A French Celt said that. He
  1536	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail.
  1537	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1538	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I will tell you, he said solemnly, what is his proudest boast. I paid
  1539	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmy way.
  1540	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1541	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGood man, good man.
  1542	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1543	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I paid my way. I never borrowed a shilling in my life. Can you feel
  1544	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat? I owe nothing. Can you?
  1545	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1546	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMulligan, nine pounds, three pairs of socks, one pair brogues, ties.
  1547	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCurran, ten guineas. McCann, one guinea. Fred Ryan, two shillings.
  1548	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTemple, two lunches. Russell, one guinea, Cousins, ten shillings, Bob
  1549	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tReynolds, half a guinea, Koehler, three guineas, Mrs MacKernan, five
  1550	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tweeks’ board. The lump I have is useless.
  1551	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1552	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—For the moment, no, Stephen answered.
  1553	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1554	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Deasy laughed with rich delight, putting back his savingsbox.
  1555	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1556	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I knew you couldn’t, he said joyously. But one day you must feel it. We
  1557	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tare a generous people but we must also be just.
  1558	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1559	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I fear those big words, Stephen said, which make us so unhappy.
  1560	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1561	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the
  1562	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshapely bulk of a man in tartan fillibegs: Albert Edward, prince of
  1563	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWales.
  1564	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1565	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You think me an old fogey and an old tory, his thoughtful voice said.
  1566	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI saw three generations since O’Connell’s time. I remember the famine in
  1567	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t‘46. Do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the
  1568	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunion twenty years before O’Connell did or before the prelates of your
  1569	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcommunion denounced him as a demagogue? You fenians forget some things.
  1570	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1571	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGlorious, pious and immortal memory. The lodge of Diamond in Armagh the
  1572	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsplendid behung with corpses of papishes. Hoarse, masked and armed, the
  1573	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplanters’ covenant. The black north and true blue bible. Croppies lie
  1574	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdown.
  1575	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1576	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen sketched a brief gesture.
  1577	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1578	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I have rebel blood in me too, Mr Deasy said. On the spindle side. But I
  1579	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tam descended from sir John Blackwood who voted for the union. We are all
  1580	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIrish, all kings’ sons.
  1581	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1582	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Alas, Stephen said.
  1583	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1584	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Per vias rectas, Mr Deasy said firmly, was his motto. He voted for it
  1585	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand put on his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of Down to do
  1586	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tso.

  1592	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSoft day, your honour!... Day!... Day!... Two topboots jog dangling on
  1593	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto Dublin. Lal the ral the ra. Lal the ral the raddy.
  1594	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1595	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That reminds me, Mr Deasy said. You can do me a favour, Mr Dedalus,
  1596	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith some of your literary friends. I have a letter here for the press.
  1597	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSit down a moment. I have just to copy the end.
  1598	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1599	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe went to the desk near the window, pulled in his chair twice and read
  1600	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\toff some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter.
  1601	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1602	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Sit down. Excuse me, he said over his shoulder, the dictates of common
  1603	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsense. Just a moment.
  1604	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1605	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow
  1606	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand, muttering, began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly,
  1607	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error.
  1608	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1609	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence. Framed
  1610	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\taround the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage, their meek
  1611	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\theads poised in air: lord Hastings’ Repulse, the duke of Westminster’s
  1612	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShotover, the duke of Beaufort’s Ceylon, prix de Paris, 1866. Elfin
  1613	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\triders sat them, watchful of a sign. He saw their speeds, backing king’s
  1614	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcolours, and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds.
  1615	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1616	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Full stop, Mr Deasy bade his keys. But prompt ventilation of this
  1617	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tallimportant question...
  1618	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1619	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhere Cranly led me to get rich quick, hunting his winners among the
  1620	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmudsplashed brakes, amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek
  1621	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the canteen, over the motley slush. Even money Fair Rebel. Ten to one
  1622	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe field. Dicers and thimbleriggers we hurried by after the hoofs, the
  1623	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvying caps and jackets and past the meatfaced woman, a butcher’s dame,
  1624	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnuzzling thirstily her clove of orange.
  1625	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1626	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShouts rang shrill from the boys’ playfield and a whirring whistle.
  1627	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1628	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAgain: a goal. I am among them, among their battling bodies in a medley,
  1629	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe joust of life. You mean that knockkneed mother’s darling who seems
  1630	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto be slightly crawsick? Jousts. Time shocked rebounds, shock by shock.
  1631	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJousts, slush and uproar of battles, the frozen deathspew of the slain,
  1632	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta shout of spearspikes baited with men’s bloodied guts.
  1633	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1634	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Now then, Mr Deasy said, rising.
  1635	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1636	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe came to the table, pinning together his sheets. Stephen stood up.
  1637	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1638	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I have put the matter into a nutshell, Mr Deasy said. It’s about
  1639	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe foot and mouth disease. Just look through it. There can be no two
  1640	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\topinions on the matter.
  1641	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1642	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMay I trespass on your valuable space. That doctrine of laissez faire
  1643	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhich so often in our history. Our cattle trade. The way of all our old
  1644	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tindustries. Liverpool ring which jockeyed the Galway harbour scheme.
  1645	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEuropean conflagration. Grain supplies through the narrow waters of
  1646	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe channel. The pluterperfect imperturbability of the department of
  1647	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tagriculture. Pardoned a classical allusion. Cassandra. By a woman who
  1648	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas no better than she should be. To come to the point at issue.
  1649	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1650	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I don’t mince words, do I? Mr Deasy asked as Stephen read on.
  1651	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1652	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFoot and mouth disease. Known as Koch’s preparation. Serum and virus.

  1657	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thospitality of your columns.
  1658	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1659	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I want that to be printed and read, Mr Deasy said. You will see at the
  1660	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnext outbreak they will put an embargo on Irish cattle. And it can
  1661	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbe cured. It is cured. My cousin, Blackwood Price, writes to me it is
  1662	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tregularly treated and cured in Austria by cattledoctors there. They
  1663	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\toffer to come over here. I am trying to work up influence with
  1664	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe department. Now I’m going to try publicity. I am surrounded by
  1665	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdifficulties, by... intrigues by... backstairs influence by...
  1666	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1667	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke.
  1668	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1669	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Mark my words, Mr Dedalus, he said. England is in the hands of the
  1670	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjews. In all the highest places: her finance, her press. And they are
  1671	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe signs of a nation’s decay. Wherever they gather they eat up the
  1672	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnation’s vital strength. I have seen it coming these years. As sure
  1673	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of
  1674	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdestruction. Old England is dying.
  1675	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1676	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe stepped swiftly off, his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a
  1677	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbroad sunbeam. He faced about and back again.
  1678	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1679	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Dying, he said again, if not dead by now.
  1680	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1681	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     The harlot’s cry from street to street
  1682	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     Shall weave old England’s windingsheet.
  1683	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1684	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which
  1685	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the halted.
  1686	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1687	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—A merchant, Stephen said, is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew or
  1688	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgentile, is he not?
  1689	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1690	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—They sinned against the light, Mr Deasy said gravely. And you can see
  1691	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe darkness in their eyes. And that is why they are wanderers on the
  1692	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tearth to this day.
  1693	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1694	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOn the steps of the Paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting
  1695	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprices on their gemmed fingers. Gabble of geese. They swarmed loud,
  1696	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tuncouth about the temple, their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk
  1697	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thats. Not theirs: these clothes, this speech, these gestures. Their full
  1698	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tslow eyes belied the words, the gestures eager and unoffending, but
  1699	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknew the rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain. Vain
  1700	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpatience to heap and hoard. Time surely would scatter all. A hoard
  1701	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\theaped by the roadside: plundered and passing on. Their eyes knew their
  1702	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyears of wandering and, patient, knew the dishonours of their flesh.
  1703	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1704	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Who has not? Stephen said.
  1705	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1706	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What do you mean? Mr Deasy asked.
  1707	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1708	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe came forward a pace and stood by the table. His underjaw fell
  1709	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsideways open uncertainly. Is this old wisdom? He waits to hear from me.
  1710	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1711	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake.
  1712	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1713	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFrom the playfield the boys raised a shout. A whirring whistle: goal.
  1714	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhat if that nightmare gave you a back kick?
  1715	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1716	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The ways of the Creator are not our ways, Mr Deasy said. All human
  1717	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thistory moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God.
  1718	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1719	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen jerked his thumb towards the window, saying:
  1720	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1721	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That is God.
  1722	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1723	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHooray! Ay! Whrrwhee!
  1724	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1725	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What? Mr Deasy asked.
  1726	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1727	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—A shout in the street, Stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders.
  1728	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1729	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked
  1730	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbetween his fingers. Looking up again he set them free.
  1731	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1732	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I am happier than you are, he said. We have committed many errors and
  1733	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmany sins. A woman brought sin into the world. For a woman who was no
  1734	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbetter than she should be, Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten
  1735	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyears the Greeks made war on Troy. A faithless wife first brought the
  1736	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstrangers to our shore here, MacMurrough’s wife and her leman, O’Rourke,
  1737	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprince of Breffni. A woman too brought Parnell low. Many errors, many
  1738	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfailures but not the one sin. I am a struggler now at the end of my
  1739	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdays. But I will fight for the right till the end.
  1740	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1741	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     For Ulster will fight
  1742	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     And Ulster will be right.
  1743	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1744	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen raised the sheets in his hand.
  1745	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1746	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Well, sir, he began.
  1747	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1748	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I foresee, Mr Deasy said, that you will not remain here very long at
  1749	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthis work. You were not born to be a teacher, I think. Perhaps I am
  1750	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twrong.
  1751	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1752	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—A learner rather, Stephen said.
  1753	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1754	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd here what will you learn more?
  1755	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1756	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Deasy shook his head.
  1757	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1758	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Who knows? he said. To learn one must be humble. But life is the great
  1759	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tteacher.
  1760	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1761	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen rustled the sheets again.
  1762	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1763	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—As regards these, he began.
  1764	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1765	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, Mr Deasy said. You have two copies there. If you can have them
  1766	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpublished at once.
  1767	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1768	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTelegraph. Irish Homestead.
  1769	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1770	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I will try, Stephen said, and let you know tomorrow. I know two editors
  1771	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tslightly.
  1772	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1773	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That will do, Mr Deasy said briskly. I wrote last night to Mr Field,
  1774	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tM.P. There is a meeting of the cattletraders’ association today at the
  1775	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCity Arms hotel. I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting. You
  1776	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsee if you can get it into your two papers. What are they?
  1777	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1778	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The Evening Telegraph...
  1779	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1780	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That will do, Mr Deasy said. There is no time to lose. Now I have to
  1781	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanswer that letter from my cousin.

  1783	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Good morning, sir, Stephen said, putting the sheets in his pocket.
  1784	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThank you.
  1785	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1786	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Not at all, Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk. I like
  1787	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto break a lance with you, old as I am.
  1788	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1789	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Good morning, sir, Stephen said again, bowing to his bent back.
  1790	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1791	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees,

  1793	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate:

  1796	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1797	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Mr Dedalus!
  1798	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1799	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRunning after me. No more letters, I hope.
  1800	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1801	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Just one moment.
  1802	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1803	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, sir, Stephen said, turning back at the gate.
  1804	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1805	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Deasy halted, breathing hard and swallowing his breath.
  1806	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1807	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I just wanted to say, he said. Ireland, they say, has the honour of
  1808	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeing the only country which never persecuted the jews. Do you know
  1809	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat? No. And do you know why?
  1810	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1811	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe frowned sternly on the bright air.
  1812	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1813	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Why, sir? Stephen asked, beginning to smile.
  1814	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1815	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Because she never let them in, Mr Deasy said solemnly.
  1816	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1817	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a
  1818	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trattling chain of phlegm. He turned back quickly, coughing, laughing,
  1819	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this lifted arms waving to the air.
  1820	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1821	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—She never let them in, he cried again through his laughter as he
  1822	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path. That’s why.
  1823	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  1824	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOn his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung

  2463	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls.
  2464	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart,
  2465	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tliverslices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods’ roes. Most of all
  2466	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of
  2467	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfaintly scented urine.
  2468	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2469	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly, righting
  2470	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther breakfast things on the humpy tray. Gelid light and air were in the
  2471	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tkitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere. Made him feel

  2473	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2474	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe coals were reddening.
  2475	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2476	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnother slice of bread and butter: three, four: right. She didn’t like
  2477	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther plate full. Right. He turned from the tray, lifted the kettle off
  2478	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe hob and set it sideways on the fire. It sat there, dull and squat,
  2479	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tits spout stuck out. Cup of tea soon. Good. Mouth dry. The cat walked
  2480	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstiffly round a leg of the table with tail on high.
  2481	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2482	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Mkgnao!
  2483	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2484	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O, there you are, Mr Bloom said, turning from the fire.
  2485	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2486	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the
  2487	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttable, mewing. Just how she stalks over my writingtable. Prr. Scratch my

  2489	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2490	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom watched curiously, kindly the lithe black form. Clean to see:
  2491	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe gloss of her sleek hide, the white button under the butt of her
  2492	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttail, the green flashing eyes. He bent down to her, his hands on his
  2493	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknees.
  2494	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2495	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Milk for the pussens, he said.

  2498	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2499	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey call them stupid. They understand what we say better than we

  2501	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCruel. Her nature. Curious mice never squeal. Seem to like it. Wonder
  2502	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhat I look like to her. Height of a tower? No, she can jump me.
  2503	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2504	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Afraid of the chickens she is, he said mockingly. Afraid of the

  2510	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand long, showing him her milkwhite teeth. He watched the dark eyeslits
  2511	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnarrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones. Then he went to
  2512	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe dresser, took the jug Hanlon’s milkman had just filled for him,
  2513	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpoured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor.
  2514	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2515	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Gurrhr! she cried, running to lap.
  2516	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2517	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped
  2518	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthree times and licked lightly. Wonder is it true if you clip them they
  2519	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcan’t mouse after. Why? They shine in the dark, perhaps, the tips. Or
  2520	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tkind of feelers in the dark, perhaps.
  2521	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2522	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe listened to her licking lap. Ham and eggs, no. No good eggs with this
  2523	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdrouth. Want pure fresh water. Thursday: not a good day either for a
  2524	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmutton kidney at Buckley’s. Fried with butter, a shake of pepper. Better
  2525	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta pork kidney at Dlugacz’s. While the kettle is boiling. She lapped
  2526	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tslower, then licking the saucer clean. Why are their tongues so rough?
  2527	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTo lap better, all porous holes. Nothing she can eat? He glanced round
  2528	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim. No.
  2529	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2530	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOn quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall, paused by
  2531	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe bedroom door. She might like something tasty. Thin bread and butter
  2532	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe likes in the morning. Still perhaps: once in a way.
  2533	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2534	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe said softly in the bare hall:
  2535	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2536	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I’m going round the corner. Be back in a minute.
  2537	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2538	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd when he had heard his voice say it he added:
  2539	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2540	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You don’t want anything for breakfast?
  2541	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2542	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA sleepy soft grunt answered:
  2543	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2544	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Mn.
  2545	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2546	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNo. She didn’t want anything. He heard then a warm heavy sigh, softer,
  2547	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled.
  2548	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMust get those settled really. Pity. All the way from Gibraltar.
  2549	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tForgotten any little Spanish she knew. Wonder what her father gave for

  2551	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGot a short knock. Hard as nails at a bargain, old Tweedy. Yes, sir. At
  2552	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPlevna that was. I rose from the ranks, sir, and I’m proud of it.
  2553	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStill he had brains enough to make that corner in stamps. Now that was
  2554	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfarseeing.

  2556	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat

  2559	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely: Plasto’s

  2566	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe halldoor to after him very quietly, more, till the footleaf dropped
  2567	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgently over the threshold, a limp lid. Looked shut. All right till I

  2570	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe crossed to the bright side, avoiding the loose cellarflap of number
  2571	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseventyfive. The sun was nearing the steeple of George’s church. Be a
  2572	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twarm day I fancy. Specially in these black clothes feel it more. Black
  2573	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconducts, reflects, (refracts is it?), the heat. But I couldn’t go in
  2574	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat light suit. Make a picnic of it. His eyelids sank quietly often as
  2575	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the walked in happy warmth. Boland’s breadvan delivering with trays our
  2576	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdaily but she prefers yesterday’s loaves turnovers crisp crowns hot.
  2577	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMakes you feel young. Somewhere in the east: early morning: set off at
  2578	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdawn. Travel round in front of the sun, steal a day’s march on him. Keep
  2579	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit up for ever never grow a day older technically. Walk along a strand,
  2580	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstrange land, come to a city gate, sentry there, old ranker too, old
  2581	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTweedy’s big moustaches, leaning on a long kind of a spear. Wander
  2582	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthrough awned streets. Turbaned faces going by. Dark caves of carpet
  2583	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshops, big man, Turko the terrible, seated crosslegged, smoking a coiled
  2584	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpipe. Cries of sellers in the streets. Drink water scented with fennel,
  2585	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsherbet. Dander along all day. Might meet a robber or two. Well,
  2586	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmeet him. Getting on to sundown. The shadows of the mosques among the
  2587	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpillars: priest with a scroll rolled up. A shiver of the trees, signal,
  2588	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe evening wind. I pass on. Fading gold sky. A mother watches me from
  2589	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther doorway. She calls her children home in their dark language. High
  2590	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twall: beyond strings twanged. Night sky, moon, violet, colour of Molly’s
  2591	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnew garters. Strings. Listen. A girl playing one of those instruments
  2592	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhat do you call them: dulcimers. I pass.
  2593	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2594	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tProbably not a bit like it really. Kind of stuff you read: in the track
  2595	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the sun. Sunburst on the titlepage. He smiled, pleasing himself.
  2596	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhat Arthur Griffith said about the headpiece over the Freeman leader: a
  2597	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thomerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway behind the bank
  2598	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof Ireland. He prolonged his pleased smile. Ikey touch that: homerule
  2599	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsun rising up in the northwest.
  2600	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2601	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe approached Larry O’Rourke’s. From the cellar grating floated up the
  2602	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tflabby gush of porter. Through the open doorway the bar squirted out
  2603	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhiffs of ginger, teadust, biscuitmush. Good house, however: just the
  2604	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tend of the city traffic. For instance M’Auley’s down there: n. g. as
  2605	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tposition. Of course if they ran a tramline along the North Circular from
  2606	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe cattlemarket to the quays value would go up like a shot.
  2607	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2608	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBaldhead over the blind. Cute old codger. No use canvassing him for an
  2609	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tad. Still he knows his own business best. There he is, sure enough, my
  2610	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbold Larry, leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching
  2611	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe aproned curate swab up with mop and bucket. Simon Dedalus takes him
  2612	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\toff to a tee with his eyes screwed up. Do you know what I’m going to
  2613	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttell you? What’s that, Mr O’Rourke? Do you know what? The Russians,
  2614	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey’d only be an eight o’clock breakfast for the Japanese.
  2615	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2616	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStop and say a word: about the funeral perhaps. Sad thing about poor
  2617	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDignam, Mr O’Rourke.
  2618	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2619	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTurning into Dorset street he said freshly in greeting through the
  2620	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdoorway:
  2621	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2622	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Good day, Mr O’Rourke.
  2623	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2624	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Good day to you.
  2625	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2626	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Lovely weather, sir.
  2627	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2628	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—‘Tis all that.
  2629	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2630	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhere do they get the money? Coming up redheaded curates from the county
  2631	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLeitrim, rinsing empties and old man in the cellar. Then, lo and behold,
  2632	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey blossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons. Then think of the
  2633	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcompetition. General thirst. Good puzzle would be cross Dublin without
  2634	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpassing a pub. Save it they can’t. Off the drunks perhaps. Put down
  2635	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthree and carry five. What is that, a bob here and there, dribs and
  2636	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdrabs. On the wholesale orders perhaps. Doing a double shuffle with the
  2637	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttown travellers. Square it you with the boss and we’ll split the job,
  2638	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsee?
  2639	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2640	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHow much would that tot to off the porter in the month? Say ten barrels
  2641	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof stuff. Say he got ten per cent off. O more. Fifteen. He passed Saint
  2642	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJoseph’s National school. Brats’ clamour. Windows open. Fresh air
  2643	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thelps memory. Or a lilt. Ahbeesee defeegee kelomen opeecue rustyouvee

  2646	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2647	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe halted before Dlugacz’s window, staring at the hanks of sausages,
  2648	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpolonies, black and white. Fifteen multiplied by. The figures whitened
  2649	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin his mind, unsolved: displeased, he let them fade. The shiny links,
  2650	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpacked with forcemeat, fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the
  2651	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlukewarm breath of cooked spicy pigs’ blood.
  2652	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2653	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish: the last. He
  2654	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstood by the nextdoor girl at the counter. Would she buy it too, calling
  2655	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe items from a slip in her hand? Chapped: washingsoda. And a pound and
  2656	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta half of Denny’s sausages. His eyes rested on her vigorous hips.
  2657	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWoods his name is. Wonder what he does. Wife is oldish. New blood.
  2658	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNo followers allowed. Strong pair of arms. Whacking a carpet on the
  2659	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tclothesline. She does whack it, by George. The way her crooked skirt
  2660	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tswings at each whack.
  2661	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2662	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with
  2663	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblotchy fingers, sausagepink. Sound meat there: like a stallfed heifer.
  2664	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2665	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe took a page up from the pile of cut sheets: the model farm at
  2666	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKinnereth on the lakeshore of Tiberias. Can become ideal winter
  2667	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsanatorium. Moses Montefiore. I thought he was. Farmhouse, wall round
  2668	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit, blurred cattle cropping. He held the page from him: interesting:
  2669	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tread it nearer, the title, the blurred cropping cattle, the page
  2670	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trustling. A young white heifer. Those mornings in the cattlemarket, the
  2671	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeasts lowing in their pens, branded sheep, flop and fall of dung, the
  2672	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbreeders in hobnailed boots trudging through the litter, slapping a palm
  2673	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton a ripemeated hindquarter, there’s a prime one, unpeeled switches in
  2674	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir hands. He held the page aslant patiently, bending his senses and
  2675	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this will, his soft subject gaze at rest. The crooked skirt swinging,
  2676	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhack by whack by whack.
  2677	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2678	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile, wrapped up her prime
  2679	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsausages and made a red grimace.
  2680	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2681	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Now, my miss, he said.
  2682	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2683	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe tendered a coin, smiling boldly, holding her thick wrist out.
  2684	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2685	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Thank you, my miss. And one shilling threepence change. For you,
  2686	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplease?
  2687	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2688	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom pointed quickly. To catch up and walk behind her if she went
  2689	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tslowly, behind her moving hams. Pleasant to see first thing in the
  2690	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmorning. Hurry up, damn it. Make hay while the sun shines. She stood
  2691	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\toutside the shop in sunlight and sauntered lazily to the right. He
  2692	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsighed down his nose: they never understand. Sodachapped hands. Crusted
  2693	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttoenails too. Brown scapulars in tatters, defending her both ways.
  2694	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe sting of disregard glowed to weak pleasure within his breast. For
  2695	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanother: a constable off duty cuddling her in Eccles’ Lane. They like
  2696	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem sizeable. Prime sausage. O please, Mr Policeman, I’m lost in the
  2697	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twood.
  2698	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2699	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Threepence, please.
  2700	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2701	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis hand accepted the moist tender gland and slid it into a sidepocket.
  2702	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThen it fetched up three coins from his trousers’ pocket and laid them
  2703	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton the rubber prickles. They lay, were read quickly and quickly slid,
  2704	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdisc by disc, into the till.
  2705	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2706	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Thank you, sir. Another time.
  2707	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2708	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him. He withdrew his gaze
  2709	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tafter an instant. No: better not: another time.
  2710	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2711	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Good morning, he said, moving away.
  2712	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2713	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Good morning, sir.
  2714	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2715	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNo sign. Gone. What matter?
  2716	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2717	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe walked back along Dorset street, reading gravely. Agendath Netaim:
  2718	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplanters’ company. To purchase waste sandy tracts from Turkish
  2719	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgovernment and plant with eucalyptus trees. Excellent for shade, fuel
  2720	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand construction. Orangegroves and immense melonfields north of Jaffa.
  2721	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tYou pay eighty marks and they plant a dunam of land for you with olives,
  2722	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\toranges, almonds or citrons. Olives cheaper: oranges need artificial
  2723	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tirrigation. Every year you get a sending of the crop. Your name entered
  2724	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor life as owner in the book of the union. Can pay ten down and the
  2725	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbalance in yearly instalments. Bleibtreustrasse 34, Berlin, W. 15.
  2726	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2727	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNothing doing. Still an idea behind it.
  2728	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2729	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe looked at the cattle, blurred in silver heat. Silverpowdered
  2730	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tolivetrees. Quiet long days: pruning, ripening. Olives are packed in
  2731	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjars, eh? I have a few left from Andrews. Molly spitting them out. Knows
  2732	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe taste of them now. Oranges in tissue paper packed in crates. Citrons
  2733	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttoo. Wonder is poor Citron still in Saint Kevin’s parade. And Mastiansky
  2734	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith the old cither. Pleasant evenings we had then. Molly in Citron’s
  2735	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbasketchair. Nice to hold, cool waxen fruit, hold in the hand, lift it
  2736	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto the nostrils and smell the perfume. Like that, heavy, sweet, wild
  2737	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tperfume. Always the same, year after year. They fetched high prices too,
  2738	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMoisel told me. Arbutus place: Pleasants street: pleasant old times.
  2739	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMust be without a flaw, he said. Coming all that way: Spain, Gibraltar,
  2740	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMediterranean, the Levant. Crates lined up on the quayside at Jaffa,
  2741	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchap ticking them off in a book, navvies handling them barefoot in
  2742	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsoiled dungarees. There’s whatdoyoucallhim out of. How do you? Doesn’t
  2743	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsee. Chap you know just to salute bit of a bore. His back is like that
  2744	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNorwegian captain’s. Wonder if I’ll meet him today. Watering cart. To
  2745	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprovoke the rain. On earth as it is in heaven.
  2746	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2747	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA cloud began to cover the sun slowly, wholly. Grey. Far.
  2748	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2749	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNo, not like that. A barren land, bare waste. Vulcanic lake, the dead
  2750	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsea: no fish, weedless, sunk deep in the earth. No wind could lift those
  2751	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twaves, grey metal, poisonous foggy waters. Brimstone they called it
  2752	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\training down: the cities of the plain: Sodom, Gomorrah, Edom. All dead
  2753	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnames. A dead sea in a dead land, grey and old. Old now. It bore the
  2754	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\toldest, the first race. A bent hag crossed from Cassidy’s, clutching a
  2755	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnaggin bottle by the neck. The oldest people. Wandered far away over
  2756	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall the earth, captivity to captivity, multiplying, dying, being born
  2757	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\teverywhere. It lay there now. Now it could bear no more. Dead: an old
  2758	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twoman’s: the grey sunken cunt of the world.
  2759	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2760	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDesolation.
  2761	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2762	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGrey horror seared his flesh. Folding the page into his pocket he turned
  2763	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinto Eccles street, hurrying homeward. Cold oils slid along his veins,
  2764	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchilling his blood: age crusting him with a salt cloak. Well, I am here
  2765	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnow. Yes, I am here now. Morning mouth bad images. Got up wrong side of
  2766	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe bed. Must begin again those Sandow’s exercises. On the hands down.
  2767	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBlotchy brown brick houses. Number eighty still unlet. Why is that?
  2768	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tValuation is only twentyeight. Towers, Battersby, North, MacArthur:
  2769	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tparlour windows plastered with bills. Plasters on a sore eye. To smell
  2770	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe gentle smoke of tea, fume of the pan, sizzling butter. Be near her
  2771	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tample bedwarmed flesh. Yes, yes.
  2772	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2773	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tQuick warm sunlight came running from Berkeley road, swiftly, in slim
  2774	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsandals, along the brightening footpath. Runs, she runs to meet me, a
  2775	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgirl with gold hair on the wind.
  2776	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2777	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTwo letters and a card lay on the hallfloor. He stooped and gathered
  2778	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem. Mrs Marion Bloom. His quickened heart slowed at once. Bold hand.
  2779	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMrs Marion.
  2780	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2781	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Poldy!
  2782	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2783	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEntering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm
  2784	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyellow twilight towards her tousled head.
  2785	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2786	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Who are the letters for?
  2787	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2788	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe looked at them. Mullingar. Milly.
  2789	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2790	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—A letter for me from Milly, he said carefully, and a card to you. And a
  2791	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tletter for you.
  2792	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2793	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of her
  2794	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknees.
  2795	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2796	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Do you want the blind up?
  2797	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2798	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLetting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her
  2799	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow.
  2800	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2801	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That do? he asked, turning.
  2802	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2803	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe was reading the card, propped on her elbow.
  2804	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2805	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—She got the things, she said.
  2806	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2807	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back
  2808	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tslowly with a snug sigh.
  2809	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2810	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Hurry up with that tea, she said. I’m parched.
  2811	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2812	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The kettle is boiling, he said.
  2813	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2814	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut he delayed to clear the chair: her striped petticoat, tossed soiled
  2815	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlinen: and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed.
  2816	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2817	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAs he went down the kitchen stairs she called:
  2818	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2819	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Poldy!
  2820	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2821	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What?
  2822	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2823	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Scald the teapot.
  2824	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2825	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOn the boil sure enough: a plume of steam from the spout. He scalded and
  2826	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea, tilting the
  2827	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tkettle then to let the water flow in. Having set it to draw he took off
  2828	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe kettle, crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the lump
  2829	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof butter slide and melt. While he unwrapped the kidney the cat mewed
  2830	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thungrily against him. Give her too much meat she won’t mouse. Say they
  2831	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twon’t eat pork. Kosher. Here. He let the bloodsmeared paper fall to
  2832	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther and dropped the kidney amid the sizzling butter sauce. Pepper. He
  2833	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsprinkled it through his fingers ringwise from the chipped eggcup.
  2834	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2835	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThen he slit open his letter, glancing down the page and over. Thanks:
  2836	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnew tam: Mr Coghlan: lough Owel picnic: young student: Blazes Boylan’s
  2837	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseaside girls.
  2838	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2839	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe tea was drawn. He filled his own moustachecup, sham crown Derby,
  2840	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsmiling. Silly Milly’s birthday gift. Only five she was then. No, wait:
  2841	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfour. I gave her the amberoid necklace she broke. Putting pieces of
  2842	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfolded brown paper in the letterbox for her. He smiled, pouring.
  2843	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2844	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     O, Milly Bloom, you are my darling.
  2845	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     You are my lookingglass from night to morning.
  2846	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     I’d rather have you without a farthing
  2847	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     Than Katey Keogh with her ass and garden.
  2848	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2849	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPoor old professor Goodwin. Dreadful old case. Still he was a courteous
  2850	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\told chap. Oldfashioned way he used to bow Molly off the platform. And
  2851	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe little mirror in his silk hat. The night Milly brought it into
  2852	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe parlour. O, look what I found in professor Goodwin’s hat! All we
  2853	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlaughed. Sex breaking out even then. Pert little piece she was.
  2854	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2855	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over: then fitted the
  2856	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tteapot on the tray. Its hump bumped as he took it up. Everything on
  2857	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit? Bread and butter, four, sugar, spoon, her cream. Yes. He carried it
  2858	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tupstairs, his thumb hooked in the teapot handle.
  2859	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2860	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it on
  2861	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe chair by the bedhead.
  2862	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2863	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What a time you were! she said.
  2864	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2865	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly, an elbow on
  2866	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe pillow. He looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large soft
  2867	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbubs, sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat’s udder. The warmth
  2868	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof her couched body rose on the air, mingling with the fragrance of the
  2869	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttea she poured.
  2870	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2871	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow. In the
  2872	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tact of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread.
  2873	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2874	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Who was the letter from? he asked.
  2875	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2876	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBold hand. Marion.
  2877	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2878	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O, Boylan, she said. He’s bringing the programme.
  2879	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2880	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What are you singing?
  2881	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2882	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Là ci darem with J. C. Doyle, she said, and Love’s Old Sweet Song.
  2883	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2884	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHer full lips, drinking, smiled. Rather stale smell that incense leaves
  2885	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnext day. Like foul flowerwater.
  2886	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2887	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Would you like the window open a little?
  2888	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2889	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe doubled a slice of bread into her mouth, asking:
  2890	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2891	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What time is the funeral?
  2892	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2893	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Eleven, I think, he answered. I didn’t see the paper.
  2894	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2895	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFollowing the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled
  2896	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdrawers from the bed. No? Then, a twisted grey garter looped round a
  2897	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstocking: rumpled, shiny sole.
  2898	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2899	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—No: that book.
  2900	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2901	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOther stocking. Her petticoat.
  2902	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2903	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—It must have fell down, she said.
  2904	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2905	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe felt here and there. Voglio e non vorrei. Wonder if she pronounces
  2906	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat right: voglio. Not in the bed. Must have slid down. He stooped and
  2907	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlifted the valance. The book, fallen, sprawled against the bulge of the
  2908	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\torangekeyed chamberpot.
  2909	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2910	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Show here, she said. I put a mark in it. There’s a word I wanted to ask
  2911	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou.
  2912	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2913	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe swallowed a draught of tea from her cup held by nothandle and,
  2914	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thaving wiped her fingertips smartly on the blanket, began to search the
  2915	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttext with the hairpin till she reached the word.
  2916	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2917	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Met him what? he asked.
  2918	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2919	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Here, she said. What does that mean?
  2920	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2921	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail.
  2922	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2923	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Metempsychosis?
  2924	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2925	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes. Who’s he when he’s at home?
  2926	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2927	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Metempsychosis, he said, frowning. It’s Greek: from the Greek. That
  2928	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmeans the transmigration of souls.
  2929	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2930	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O, rocks! she said. Tell us in plain words.
  2931	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2932	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe smiled, glancing askance at her mocking eyes. The same young eyes.
  2933	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe first night after the charades. Dolphin’s Barn. He turned over the
  2934	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsmudged pages. Ruby: the Pride of the Ring. Hello. Illustration. Fierce
  2935	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tItalian with carriagewhip. Must be Ruby pride of the on the floor naked.
  2936	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSheet kindly lent. The monster Maffei desisted and flung his victim
  2937	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom him with an oath. Cruelty behind it all. Doped animals. Trapeze at
  2938	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHengler’s. Had to look the other way. Mob gaping. Break your neck
  2939	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand we’ll break our sides. Families of them. Bone them young so they
  2940	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmetamspychosis. That we live after death. Our souls. That a man’s soul
  2941	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tafter he dies. Dignam’s soul...
  2942	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2943	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Did you finish it? he asked.
  2944	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2945	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, she said. There’s nothing smutty in it. Is she in love with the
  2946	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfirst fellow all the time?
  2947	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2948	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Never read it. Do you want another?
  2949	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2950	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes. Get another of Paul de Kock’s. Nice name he has.
  2951	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2952	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe poured more tea into her cup, watching it flow sideways.
  2953	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2954	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMust get that Capel street library book renewed or they’ll write to
  2955	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKearney, my guarantor. Reincarnation: that’s the word.
  2956	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2957	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Some people believe, he said, that we go on living in another body
  2958	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tafter death, that we lived before. They call it reincarnation. That
  2959	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twe all lived before on the earth thousands of years ago or some other
  2960	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplanet. They say we have forgotten it. Some say they remember their past
  2961	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlives.
  2962	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2963	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe sluggish cream wound curdling spirals through her tea. Better remind
  2964	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther of the word: metempsychosis. An example would be better. An example?
  2965	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2966	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe Bath of the Nymph over the bed. Given away with the Easter number of
  2967	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPhoto Bits: Splendid masterpiece in art colours. Tea before you put milk
  2968	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin. Not unlike her with her hair down: slimmer. Three and six I gave
  2969	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor the frame. She said it would look nice over the bed. Naked nymphs:
  2970	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGreece: and for instance all the people that lived then.
  2971	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2972	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe turned the pages back.
  2973	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2974	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Metempsychosis, he said, is what the ancient Greeks called it. They
  2975	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tused to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree, for
  2976	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinstance. What they called nymphs, for example.
  2977	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2978	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHer spoon ceased to stir up the sugar. She gazed straight before her,
  2979	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinhaling through her arched nostrils.
  2980	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2981	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—There’s a smell of burn, she said. Did you leave anything on the fire?
  2982	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2983	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The kidney! he cried suddenly.
  2984	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2985	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and, stubbing his toes
  2986	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tagainst the broken commode, hurried out towards the smell, stepping
  2987	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thastily down the stairs with a flurried stork’s legs. Pungent smoke shot
  2988	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tup in an angry jet from a side of the pan. By prodding a prong of the
  2989	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfork under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its back.
  2990	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOnly a little burnt. He tossed it off the pan on to a plate and let the
  2991	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tscanty brown gravy trickle over it.
  2992	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  2993	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCup of tea now. He sat down, cut and buttered a slice of the loaf.
  2994	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe shore away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat. Then he put a
  2995	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tforkful into his mouth, chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant
  2996	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmeat. Done to a turn. A mouthful of tea. Then he cut away dies of bread,
  2997	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsopped one in the gravy and put it in his mouth. What was that about
  2998	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsome young student and a picnic? He creased out the letter at his side,
  2999	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\treading it slowly as he chewed, sopping another die of bread in the
  3000	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgravy and raising it to his mouth.
  3001	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3002	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDearest Papli
  3003	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3004	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThanks ever so much for the lovely birthday present. It suits me
  3005	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsplendid. Everyone says I am quite the belle in my new tam. I got
  3006	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmummy’s lovely box of creams and am writing. They are lovely. I am
  3007	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgetting on swimming in the photo business now. Mr Coghlan took one of me
  3008	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand Mrs. Will send when developed. We did great biz yesterday. Fair day
  3009	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand all the beef to the heels were in. We are going to lough Owel on
  3010	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMonday with a few friends to make a scrap picnic. Give my love to
  3011	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmummy and to yourself a big kiss and thanks. I hear them at the piano
  3012	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdownstairs. There is to be a concert in the Greville Arms on Saturday.
  3013	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThere is a young student comes here some evenings named Bannon his
  3014	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcousins or something are big swells and he sings Boylan’s (I was on the
  3015	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpop of writing Blazes Boylan’s) song about those seaside girls. Tell him
  3016	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsilly Milly sends my best respects. I must now close with fondest love
  3017	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3018	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tYour fond daughter
  3019	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3020	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMilly
  3021	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3022	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tP. S. Excuse bad writing am in hurry. Byby.
  3023	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3024	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tM.
  3025	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3026	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFifteen yesterday. Curious, fifteenth of the month too. Her first
  3027	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbirthday away from home. Separation. Remember the summer morning she
  3028	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas born, running to knock up Mrs Thornton in Denzille street. Jolly old
  3029	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twoman. Lot of babies she must have helped into the world. She knew from
  3030	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe first poor little Rudy wouldn’t live. Well, God is good, sir. She
  3031	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknew at once. He would be eleven now if he had lived.
  3032	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3033	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis vacant face stared pityingly at the postscript. Excuse bad writing.
  3034	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHurry. Piano downstairs. Coming out of her shell. Row with her in the
  3035	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tXL Café about the bracelet. Wouldn’t eat her cakes or speak or look.
  3036	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSaucebox. He sopped other dies of bread in the gravy and ate piece after
  3037	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpiece of kidney. Twelve and six a week. Not much. Still, she might do
  3038	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tworse. Music hall stage. Young student. He drank a draught of cooler tea
  3039	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto wash down his meal. Then he read the letter again: twice.
  3040	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3041	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tO, well: she knows how to mind herself. But if not? No, nothing has
  3042	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thappened. Of course it might. Wait in any case till it does. A wild
  3043	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpiece of goods. Her slim legs running up the staircase. Destiny.
  3044	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRipening now. Vain: very.
  3045	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3046	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe smiled with troubled affection at the kitchen window. Day I caught
  3047	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther in the street pinching her cheeks to make them red. Anemic a little.
  3048	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWas given milk too long. On the Erin’s King that day round the Kish.
  3049	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDamned old tub pitching about. Not a bit funky. Her pale blue scarf
  3050	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tloose in the wind with her hair.
  3051	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3052	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     All dimpled cheeks and curls,
  3053	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     Your head it simply swirls.
  3054	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3055	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3056	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSeaside girls. Torn envelope. Hands stuck in his trousers’ pockets,
  3057	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjarvey off for the day, singing. Friend of the family. Swurls, he says.
  3058	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPier with lamps, summer evening, band.
  3059	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3060	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     Those girls, those girls,
  3061	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     Those lovely seaside girls.
  3062	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3063	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMilly too. Young kisses: the first. Far away now past. Mrs Marion.
  3064	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tReading, lying back now, counting the strands of her hair, smiling,
  3065	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbraiding.
  3066	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3067	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA soft qualm, regret, flowed down his backbone, increasing. Will happen,
  3068	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyes. Prevent. Useless: can’t move. Girl’s sweet light lips. Will happen
  3069	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttoo. He felt the flowing qualm spread over him. Useless to move now.
  3070	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLips kissed, kissing, kissed. Full gluey woman’s lips.
  3071	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3072	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBetter where she is down there: away. Occupy her. Wanted a dog to pass
  3073	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe time. Might take a trip down there. August bank holiday, only two
  3074	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand six return. Six weeks off, however. Might work a press pass. Or
  3075	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthrough M’Coy.
  3076	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3077	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe cat, having cleaned all her fur, returned to the meatstained paper,
  3078	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnosed at it and stalked to the door. She looked back at him, mewing.
  3079	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWants to go out. Wait before a door sometime it will open. Let her wait.
  3080	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHas the fidgets. Electric. Thunder in the air. Was washing at her ear
  3081	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith her back to the fire too.
  3082	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3083	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe felt heavy, full: then a gentle loosening of his bowels. He stood up,
  3084	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tundoing the waistband of his trousers. The cat mewed to him.
  3085	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3086	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Miaow! he said in answer. Wait till I’m ready.
  3087	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3088	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHeaviness: hot day coming. Too much trouble to fag up the stairs to the
  3089	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlanding.
  3090	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3091	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA paper. He liked to read at stool. Hope no ape comes knocking just as
  3092	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI’m.
  3093	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3094	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIn the tabledrawer he found an old number of Titbits. He folded it under
  3095	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this armpit, went to the door and opened it. The cat went up in soft
  3096	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbounds. Ah, wanted to go upstairs, curl up in a ball on the bed.
  3097	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3098	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tListening, he heard her voice:
  3099	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3100	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Come, come, pussy. Come.
  3101	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3102	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe went out through the backdoor into the garden: stood to listen
  3103	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttowards the next garden. No sound. Perhaps hanging clothes out to dry.
  3104	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe maid was in the garden. Fine morning.
  3105	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3106	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe bent down to regard a lean file of spearmint growing by the wall.
  3107	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMake a summerhouse here. Scarlet runners. Virginia creepers. Want to
  3108	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmanure the whole place over, scabby soil. A coat of liver of sulphur.
  3109	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAll soil like that without dung. Household slops. Loam, what is this
  3110	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat is? The hens in the next garden: their droppings are very good top
  3111	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdressing. Best of all though are the cattle, especially when they are
  3112	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfed on those oilcakes. Mulch of dung. Best thing to clean ladies’ kid
  3113	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgloves. Dirty cleans. Ashes too. Reclaim the whole place. Grow peas in
  3114	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat corner there. Lettuce. Always have fresh greens then. Still gardens
  3115	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thave their drawbacks. That bee or bluebottle here Whitmonday.
  3116	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3117	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe walked on. Where is my hat, by the way? Must have put it back on the
  3118	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpeg. Or hanging up on the floor. Funny I don’t remember that. Hallstand
  3119	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttoo full. Four umbrellas, her raincloak. Picking up the letters.
  3120	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDrago’s shopbell ringing. Queer I was just thinking that moment. Brown

  3128	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe kicked open the crazy door of the jakes. Better be careful not to get
  3129	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthese trousers dirty for the funeral. He went in, bowing his head
  3130	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunder the low lintel. Leaving the door ajar, amid the stench of mouldy
  3131	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlimewash and stale cobwebs he undid his braces. Before sitting down he
  3132	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpeered through a chink up at the nextdoor windows. The king was in his
  3133	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcountinghouse. Nobody.
  3134	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3135	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAsquat on the cuckstool he folded out his paper, turning its pages over
  3136	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton his bared knees. Something new and easy. No great hurry. Keep it
  3137	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta bit. Our prize titbit: Matcham’s Masterstroke. Written by Mr Philip
  3138	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBeaufoy, Playgoers’ Club, London. Payment at the rate of one guinea
  3139	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta column has been made to the writer. Three and a half. Three pounds
  3140	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthree. Three pounds, thirteen and six.
  3141	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3142	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tQuietly he read, restraining himself, the first column and, yielding but
  3143	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tresisting, began the second. Midway, his last resistance yielding, he
  3144	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tallowed his bowels to ease themselves quietly as he read, reading still
  3145	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpatiently that slight constipation of yesterday quite gone. Hope it’s
  3146	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnot too big bring on piles again. No, just right. So. Ah! Costive. One
  3147	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttabloid of cascara sagrada. Life might be so. It did not move or touch
  3148	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim but it was something quick and neat. Print anything now. Silly
  3149	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseason. He read on, seated calm above his own rising smell. Neat
  3150	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcertainly. Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke by which he won the
  3151	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlaughing witch who now. Begins and ends morally. Hand in hand. Smart. He
  3152	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglanced back through what he had read and, while feeling his water flow
  3153	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tquietly, he envied kindly Mr Beaufoy who had written it and received
  3154	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpayment of three pounds, thirteen and six.

  3156	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMight manage a sketch. By Mr and Mrs L. M. Bloom. Invent a story for

  3158	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaid dressing. Dislike dressing together. Nicked myself shaving. Biting
  3159	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther nether lip, hooking the placket of her skirt. Timing her. 9.15.
  3160	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDid Roberts pay you yet? 9.20. What had Gretta Conroy on? 9.23. What
  3161	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpossessed me to buy this comb? 9.24. I’m swelled after that cabbage. A

  3166	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thours. Explain that: morning hours, noon, then evening coming on, then
  3167	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnight hours. Washing her teeth. That was the first night. Her head
  3168	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdancing. Her fansticks clicking. Is that Boylan well off? He has money.
  3169	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhy? I noticed he had a good rich smell off his breath dancing. No use
  3170	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thumming then. Allude to it. Strange kind of music that last night. The
  3171	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmirror was in shadow. She rubbed her handglass briskly on her woollen
  3172	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvest against her full wagging bub. Peering into it. Lines in her eyes.
  3173	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIt wouldn’t pan out somehow.
  3174	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3175	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEvening hours, girls in grey gauze. Night hours then: black with daggers

  3177	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStill, true to life also. Day: then the night.
  3178	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3179	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe tore away half the prize story sharply and wiped himself with it.
  3180	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThen he girded up his trousers, braced and buttoned himself. He pulled
  3181	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tback the jerky shaky door of the jakes and came forth from the gloom
  3182	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinto the air.
  3183	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3184	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIn the bright light, lightened and cooled in limb, he eyed carefully his
  3185	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblack trousers: the ends, the knees, the houghs of the knees. What time
  3186	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tis the funeral? Better find out in the paper.

  3188	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA creak and a dark whirr in the air high up. The bells of George’s

  3190	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3191	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     Heigho! Heigho!

  3196	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthird.
  3197	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3198	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPoor Dignam!

  3206	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBy lorries along sir John Rogerson’s quay Mr Bloom walked soberly, past
  3207	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWindmill lane, Leask’s the linseed crusher, the postal telegraph office.
  3208	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCould have given that address too. And past the sailors’ home. He turned
  3209	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom the morning noises of the quayside and walked through Lime street.
  3210	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBy Brady’s cottages a boy for the skins lolled, his bucket of offal
  3211	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlinked, smoking a chewed fagbutt. A smaller girl with scars of eczema
  3212	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton her forehead eyed him, listlessly holding her battered caskhoop. Tell
  3213	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim if he smokes he won’t grow. O let him! His life isn’t such a bed of
  3214	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\troses. Waiting outside pubs to bring da home. Come home to ma, da.
  3215	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSlack hour: won’t be many there. He crossed Townsend street, passed
  3216	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe frowning face of Bethel. El, yes: house of: Aleph, Beth. And past
  3217	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNichols’ the undertaker. At eleven it is. Time enough. Daresay Corny
  3218	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKelleher bagged the job for O’Neill’s. Singing with his eyes shut.
  3219	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCorny. Met her once in the park. In the dark. What a lark. Police tout.
  3220	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHer name and address she then told with my tooraloom tooraloom tay.
  3221	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tO, surely he bagged it. Bury him cheap in a whatyoumaycall. With my
  3222	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom, tooraloom.
  3223	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3224	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIn Westland row he halted before the window of the Belfast and Oriental
  3225	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTea Company and read the legends of leadpapered packets: choice blend,
  3226	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfinest quality, family tea. Rather warm. Tea. Must get some from Tom
  3227	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKernan. Couldn’t ask him at a funeral, though. While his eyes still read
  3228	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblandly he took off his hat quietly inhaling his hairoil and sent his
  3229	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tright hand with slow grace over his brow and hair. Very warm morning.
  3230	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tUnder their dropped lids his eyes found the tiny bow of the leather
  3231	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\theadband inside his high grade ha. Just there. His right hand came down
  3232	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinto the bowl of his hat. His fingers found quickly a card behind the
  3233	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\theadband and transferred it to his waistcoat pocket.
  3234	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3235	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSo warm. His right hand once more more slowly went over his brow and
  3236	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thair. Then he put on his hat again, relieved: and read again: choice
  3237	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblend, made of the finest Ceylon brands. The far east. Lovely spot it
  3238	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmust be: the garden of the world, big lazy leaves to float about on,
  3239	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcactuses, flowery meads, snaky lianas they call them. Wonder is it like
  3240	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat. Those Cinghalese lobbing about in the sun in dolce far niente, not
  3241	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdoing a hand’s turn all day. Sleep six months out of twelve. Too hot to
  3242	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tquarrel. Influence of the climate. Lethargy. Flowers of idleness. The
  3243	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tair feeds most. Azotes. Hothouse in Botanic gardens. Sensitive plants.
  3244	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWaterlilies. Petals too tired to. Sleeping sickness in the air. Walk on
  3245	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\troseleaves. Imagine trying to eat tripe and cowheel. Where was the chap
  3246	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI saw in that picture somewhere? Ah yes, in the dead sea floating on his
  3247	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tback, reading a book with a parasol open. Couldn’t sink if you tried: so
  3248	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthick with salt. Because the weight of the water, no, the weight of
  3249	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe body in the water is equal to the weight of the what? Or is it the
  3250	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvolume is equal to the weight? It’s a law something like that. Vance in
  3251	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHigh school cracking his fingerjoints, teaching. The college curriculum.
  3252	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCracking curriculum. What is weight really when you say the weight?
  3253	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThirtytwo feet per second per second. Law of falling bodies: per second
  3254	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tper second. They all fall to the ground. The earth. It’s the force of
  3255	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgravity of the earth is the weight.
  3256	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3257	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe turned away and sauntered across the road. How did she walk with her
  3258	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsausages? Like that something. As he walked he took the folded Freeman
  3259	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom his sidepocket, unfolded it, rolled it lengthwise in a baton and
  3260	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttapped it at each sauntering step against his trouserleg. Careless air:
  3261	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjust drop in to see. Per second per second. Per second for every second
  3262	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit means. From the curbstone he darted a keen glance through the door of
  3263	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe postoffice. Too late box. Post here. No-one. In.
  3264	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3265	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe handed the card through the brass grill.
  3266	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3267	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Are there any letters for me? he asked.
  3268	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3269	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhile the postmistress searched a pigeonhole he gazed at the recruiting
  3270	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tposter with soldiers of all arms on parade: and held the tip of his
  3271	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbaton against his nostrils, smelling freshprinted rag paper. No answer
  3272	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprobably. Went too far last time.
  3273	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3274	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe postmistress handed him back through the grill his card with a
  3275	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tletter. He thanked her and glanced rapidly at the typed envelope.
  3276	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3277	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t      Henry Flower Esq,
  3278	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t         c/o P. O. Westland Row,

  3280	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3281	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnswered anyhow. He slipped card and letter into his sidepocket,
  3282	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\treviewing again the soldiers on parade. Where’s old Tweedy’s regiment?
  3283	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCastoff soldier. There: bearskin cap and hackle plume. No, he’s a
  3284	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgrenadier. Pointed cuffs. There he is: royal Dublin fusiliers. Redcoats.
  3285	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tToo showy. That must be why the women go after them. Uniform. Easier to
  3286	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tenlist and drill. Maud Gonne’s letter about taking them off O’Connell
  3287	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstreet at night: disgrace to our Irish capital. Griffith’s paper is on
  3288	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe same tack now: an army rotten with venereal disease: overseas or
  3289	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thalfseasover empire. Half baked they look: hypnotised like. Eyes front.
  3290	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMark time. Table: able. Bed: ed. The King’s own. Never see him dressed
  3291	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tup as a fireman or a bobby. A mason, yes.
  3292	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3293	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe strolled out of the postoffice and turned to the right. Talk: as if
  3294	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat would mend matters. His hand went into his pocket and a forefinger
  3295	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfelt its way under the flap of the envelope, ripping it open in jerks.
  3296	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWomen will pay a lot of heed, I don’t think. His fingers drew forth the
  3297	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tletter the letter and crumpled the envelope in his pocket. Something
  3298	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpinned on: photo perhaps. Hair? No.
  3299	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3300	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tM’Coy. Get rid of him quickly. Take me out of my way. Hate company when
  3301	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou.
  3302	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3303	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Hello, Bloom. Where are you off to?
  3304	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3305	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Hello, M’Coy. Nowhere in particular.
  3306	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3307	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—How’s the body?
  3308	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3309	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Fine. How are you?
  3310	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3311	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Just keeping alive, M’Coy said.
  3312	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3313	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis eyes on the black tie and clothes he asked with low respect:
  3314	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3315	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Is there any... no trouble I hope? I see you’re...
  3316	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3317	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O, no, Mr Bloom said. Poor Dignam, you know. The funeral is today.
  3318	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3319	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—To be sure, poor fellow. So it is. What time?
  3320	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3321	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA photo it isn’t. A badge maybe.
  3322	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3323	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—E...eleven, Mr Bloom answered.
  3324	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3325	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I must try to get out there, M’Coy said. Eleven, is it? I only heard it
  3326	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlast night. Who was telling me? Holohan. You know Hoppy?
  3327	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3328	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I know.
  3329	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3330	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom gazed across the road at the outsider drawn up before the door
  3331	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the Grosvenor. The porter hoisted the valise up on the well. She
  3332	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstood still, waiting, while the man, husband, brother, like her,
  3333	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsearched his pockets for change. Stylish kind of coat with that roll
  3334	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcollar, warm for a day like this, looks like blanketcloth. Careless
  3335	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstand of her with her hands in those patch pockets. Like that haughty
  3336	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcreature at the polo match. Women all for caste till you touch the spot.

  3340	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3341	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I was with Bob Doran, he’s on one of his periodical bends, and what do
  3342	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou call him Bantam Lyons. Just down there in Conway’s we were.
  3343	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3344	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDoran Lyons in Conway’s. She raised a gloved hand to her hair. In came
  3345	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHoppy. Having a wet. Drawing back his head and gazing far from beneath
  3346	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this vailed eyelids he saw the bright fawn skin shine in the glare, the
  3347	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbraided drums. Clearly I can see today. Moisture about gives long sight
  3348	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tperhaps. Talking of one thing or another. Lady’s hand. Which side will
  3349	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe get up?
  3350	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3351	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And he said: Sad thing about our poor friend Paddy! What Paddy? I said.
  3352	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPoor little Paddy Dignam, he said.
  3353	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3354	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOff to the country: Broadstone probably. High brown boots with laces
  3355	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdangling. Wellturned foot. What is he foostering over that change for?
  3356	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSees me looking. Eye out for other fellow always. Good fallback. Two
  3357	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstrings to her bow.
  3358	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3359	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Why? I said. What’s wrong with him? I said.
  3360	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3361	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tProud: rich: silk stockings.
  3362	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3363	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, Mr Bloom said.
  3364	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3365	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe moved a little to the side of M’Coy’s talking head. Getting up in a
  3366	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tminute.
  3367	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3368	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What’s wrong with him? He said. He’s dead, he said. And, faith, he
  3369	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfilled up. Is it Paddy Dignam? I said. I couldn’t believe it when I
  3370	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\theard it. I was with him no later than Friday last or Thursday was it in
  3371	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe Arch. Yes, he said. He’s gone. He died on Monday, poor fellow.
  3372	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3373	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWatch! Watch! Silk flash rich stockings white. Watch!

  3376	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3377	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLost it. Curse your noisy pugnose. Feels locked out of it. Paradise and

  3381	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3382	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, yes, Mr Bloom said after a dull sigh. Another gone.
  3383	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3384	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—One of the best, M’Coy said.
  3385	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3386	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe tram passed. They drove off towards the Loop Line bridge, her rich
  3387	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgloved hand on the steel grip. Flicker, flicker: the laceflare of her
  3388	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\that in the sun: flicker, flick.

  3392	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O, yes, Mr Bloom said. Tiptop, thanks.
  3393	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3394	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe unrolled the newspaper baton idly and read idly:
  3395	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3396	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     What is home without
  3397	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     Plumtree’s Potted Meat?
  3398	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     Incomplete.
  3399	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     With it an abode of bliss.
  3400	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3401	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3402	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—My missus has just got an engagement. At least it’s not settled yet.
  3403	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3404	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tValise tack again. By the way no harm. I’m off that, thanks.
  3405	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3406	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom turned his largelidded eyes with unhasty friendliness.
  3407	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3408	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—My wife too, he said. She’s going to sing at a swagger affair in the
  3409	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tUlster Hall, Belfast, on the twentyfifth.
  3410	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3411	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That so? M’Coy said. Glad to hear that, old man. Who’s getting it up?
  3412	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3413	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMrs Marion Bloom. Not up yet. Queen was in her bedroom eating bread and.
  3414	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNo book. Blackened court cards laid along her thigh by sevens. Dark lady
  3415	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand fair man. Letter. Cat furry black ball. Torn strip of envelope.
  3416	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3417	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     Love’s
  3418	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     Old
  3419	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     Sweet
  3420	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     Song
  3421	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     Comes lo-ove’s old...
  3422	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3423	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—It’s a kind of a tour, don’t you see, Mr Bloom said thoughtfully.
  3424	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSweeeet song. There’s a committee formed. Part shares and part profits.
  3425	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3426	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tM’Coy nodded, picking at his moustache stubble.
  3427	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3428	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O, well, he said. That’s good news.
  3429	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3430	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe moved to go.
  3431	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3432	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Well, glad to see you looking fit, he said. Meet you knocking around.
  3433	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3434	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, Mr Bloom said.
  3435	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3436	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Tell you what, M’Coy said. You might put down my name at the funeral,
  3437	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twill you? I’d like to go but I mightn’t be able, you see. There’s a
  3438	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdrowning case at Sandycove may turn up and then the coroner and myself
  3439	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould have to go down if the body is found. You just shove in my name if
  3440	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI’m not there, will you?
  3441	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3442	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I’ll do that, Mr Bloom said, moving to get off. That’ll be all right.
  3443	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3444	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Right, M’Coy said brightly. Thanks, old man. I’d go if I possibly
  3445	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcould. Well, tolloll. Just C. P. M’Coy will do.
  3446	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3447	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That will be done, Mr Bloom answered firmly.
  3448	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3449	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDidn’t catch me napping that wheeze. The quick touch. Soft mark. I’d
  3450	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlike my job. Valise I have a particular fancy for. Leather. Capped
  3451	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcorners, rivetted edges, double action lever lock. Bob Cowley lent him
  3452	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this for the Wicklow regatta concert last year and never heard tidings of
  3453	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit from that good day to this.
  3454	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3455	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom, strolling towards Brunswick street, smiled. My missus has just
  3456	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgot an. Reedy freckled soprano. Cheeseparing nose. Nice enough in its
  3457	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tway: for a little ballad. No guts in it. You and me, don’t you know:
  3458	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the same boat. Softsoaping. Give you the needle that would. Can’t
  3459	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the hear the difference? Think he’s that way inclined a bit. Against
  3460	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmy grain somehow. Thought that Belfast would fetch him. I hope that
  3461	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsmallpox up there doesn’t get worse. Suppose she wouldn’t let herself be
  3462	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvaccinated again. Your wife and my wife.
  3463	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3464	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWonder is he pimping after me?
  3465	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3466	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom stood at the corner, his eyes wandering over the multicoloured
  3467	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thoardings. Cantrell and Cochrane’s Ginger Ale (Aromatic). Clery’s Summer
  3468	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSale. No, he’s going on straight. Hello. Leah tonight. Mrs Bandmann
  3469	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPalmer. Like to see her again in that. Hamlet she played last night.
  3470	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMale impersonator. Perhaps he was a woman. Why Ophelia committed
  3471	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuicide. Poor papa! How he used to talk of Kate Bateman in that. Outside
  3472	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe Adelphi in London waited all the afternoon to get in. Year before
  3473	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI was born that was: sixtyfive. And Ristori in Vienna. What is this the
  3474	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tright name is? By Mosenthal it is. Rachel, is it? No. The scene he was
  3475	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\talways talking about where the old blind Abraham recognises the voice
  3476	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand puts his fingers on his face.
  3477	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3478	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNathan’s voice! His son’s voice! I hear the voice of Nathan who left his
  3479	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfather to die of grief and misery in my arms, who left the house of his
  3480	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfather and left the God of his father.
  3481	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3482	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEvery word is so deep, Leopold.
  3483	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3484	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPoor papa! Poor man! I’m glad I didn’t go into the room to look at his
  3485	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tface. That day! O, dear! O, dear! Ffoo! Well, perhaps it was best for
  3486	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim.
  3487	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3488	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom went round the corner and passed the drooping nags of the
  3489	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thazard. No use thinking of it any more. Nosebag time. Wish I hadn’t met
  3490	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat M’Coy fellow.
  3491	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3492	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe came nearer and heard a crunching of gilded oats, the gently champing
  3493	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tteeth. Their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by, amid the sweet
  3494	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\toaten reek of horsepiss. Their Eldorado. Poor jugginses! Damn all they
  3495	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknow or care about anything with their long noses stuck in nosebags.
  3496	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tToo full for words. Still they get their feed all right and their doss.
  3497	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGelded too: a stump of black guttapercha wagging limp between their
  3498	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thaunches. Might be happy all the same that way. Good poor brutes they
  3499	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlook. Still their neigh can be very irritating.
  3500	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3501	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe drew the letter from his pocket and folded it into the newspaper he
  3502	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcarried. Might just walk into her here. The lane is safer.
  3503	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3504	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe passed the cabman’s shelter. Curious the life of drifting cabbies.
  3505	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAll weathers, all places, time or setdown, no will of their own. Voglio
  3506	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\te non. Like to give them an odd cigarette. Sociable. Shout a few flying
  3507	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsyllables as they pass. He hummed:
  3508	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3509	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     Là ci darem la mano
  3510	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     La la lala la la.
  3511	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3512	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe turned into Cumberland street and, going on some paces, halted in the
  3513	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlee of the station wall. No-one. Meade’s timberyard. Piled balks. Ruins
  3514	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand tenements. With careful tread he passed over a hopscotch court with
  3515	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tits forgotten pickeystone. Not a sinner. Near the timberyard a squatted
  3516	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchild at marbles, alone, shooting the taw with a cunnythumb. A wise
  3517	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttabby, a blinking sphinx, watched from her warm sill. Pity to disturb
  3518	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem. Mohammed cut a piece out of his mantle not to wake her. Open it.
  3519	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd once I played marbles when I went to that old dame’s school. She
  3520	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tliked mignonette. Mrs Ellis’s. And Mr? He opened the letter within the

  3530	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tawfully angry with you. I do wish I could punish you for that. I called
  3531	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou naughty boy because I do not like that other world. Please tell me
  3532	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhat is the real meaning of that word? Are you not happy in your home
  3533	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou poor little naughty boy? I do wish I could do something for you.
  3534	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPlease tell me what you think of poor me. I often think of the beautiful

  3536	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou have no idea. I have never felt myself so much drawn to a man as
  3537	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou. I feel so bad about. Please write me a long letter and tell me
  3538	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmore. Remember if you do not I will punish you. So now you know what I
  3539	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twill do to you, you naughty boy, if you do not wrote. O how I long to
  3540	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmeet you. Henry dear, do not deny my request before my patience are
  3541	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\texhausted. Then I will tell you all. Goodbye now, naughty darling, I

  3549	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe tore the flower gravely from its pinhold smelt its almost no smell
  3550	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand placed it in his heart pocket. Language of flowers. They like it
  3551	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbecause no-one can hear. Or a poison bouquet to strike him down. Then
  3552	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twalking slowly forward he read the letter again, murmuring here and
  3553	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthere a word. Angry tulips with you darling manflower punish your cactus

  3558	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3559	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWeak joy opened his lips. Changed since the first letter. Wonder did she
  3560	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twrote it herself. Doing the indignant: a girl of good family like me,
  3561	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trespectable character. Could meet one Sunday after the rosary. Thank
  3562	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou: not having any. Usual love scrimmage. Then running round corners.
  3563	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBad as a row with Molly. Cigar has a cooling effect. Narcotic. Go

  3565	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBrutal, why not? Try it anyhow. A bit at a time.
  3566	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3567	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFingering still the letter in his pocket he drew the pin out of it.
  3568	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCommon pin, eh? He threw it on the road. Out of her clothes somewhere:
  3569	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpinned together. Queer the number of pins they always have. No roses
  3570	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twithout thorns.
  3571	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3572	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFlat Dublin voices bawled in his head. Those two sluts that night in the

  3592	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNice kind of evening feeling. No more wandering about. Just loll there:

  3595	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfruit, olives, lovely cool water out of a well, stonecold like the hole
  3596	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the wall at Ashtown. Must carry a paper goblet next time I go to the

  3600	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGoing under the railway arch he took out the envelope, tore it swiftly

  3662	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe stood aside watching their blind masks pass down the aisle, one by

  3664	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tits corner, nursing his hat and newspaper. These pots we have to wear.
  3665	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWe ought to have hats modelled on our heads. They were about him here
  3666	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand there, with heads still bowed in their crimson halters, waiting for
  3667	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit to melt in their stomachs. Something like those mazzoth: it’s that
  3668	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsort of bread: unleavened shewbread. Look at them. Now I bet it makes
  3669	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem feel happy. Lollipop. It does. Yes, bread of angels it’s called.

  3673	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat. Not so lonely. In our confraternity. Then come out a bit spreeish.
  3674	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLet off steam. Thing is if you really believe in it. Lourdes cure,
  3675	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twaters of oblivion, and the Knock apparition, statues bleeding. Old

  3681	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinstant before it, showing a large grey bootsole from under the lace
  3682	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\taffair he had on. Suppose he lost the pin of his. He wouldn’t know what

  3684	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMolly told me one time I asked her. I have sinned: or no: I have

  3687	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMeet one Sunday after the rosary. Do not deny my request. Turn up with

  3689	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith a ribbon round her neck and do the other thing all the same on the
  3690	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsly. Their character. That fellow that turned queen’s evidence on the
  3691	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinvincibles he used to receive the, Carey was his name, the communion
  3692	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tevery morning. This very church. Peter Carey, yes. No, Peter Claver I am
  3693	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthinking of. Denis Carey. And just imagine that. Wife and six children
  3694	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat home. And plotting that murder all the time. Those crawthumpers,
  3695	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnow that’s a good name for them, there’s always something shiftylooking
  3696	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabout them. They’re not straight men of business either. O, no, she’s
  3697	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnot here: the flower: no, no. By the way, did I tear up that envelope?
  3698	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tYes: under the bridge.
  3699	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3700	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe priest was rinsing out the chalice: then he tossed off the dregs
  3701	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsmartly. Wine. Makes it more aristocratic than for example if he drank
  3702	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhat they are used to Guinness’s porter or some temperance beverage
  3703	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWheatley’s Dublin hop bitters or Cantrell and Cochrane’s ginger ale
  3704	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t(aromatic). Doesn’t give them any of it: shew wine: only the other.

  3706	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbooser worse than another coming along, cadging for a drink. Queer the

  3708	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3709	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom looked back towards the choir. Not going to be any music. Pity.
  3710	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWho has the organ here I wonder? Old Glynn he knew how to make that
  3711	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinstrument talk, the vibrato: fifty pounds a year they say he had in
  3712	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGardiner street. Molly was in fine voice that day, the Stabat Mater
  3713	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof Rossini. Father Bernard Vaughan’s sermon first. Christ or Pilate?
  3714	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tChrist, but don’t keep us all night over it. Music they wanted.
  3715	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFootdrill stopped. Could hear a pin drop. I told her to pitch her voice
  3716	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tagainst that corner. I could feel the thrill in the air, the full, the
  3717	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpeople looking up:
  3718	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3719	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tQuis est homo.
  3720	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3721	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSome of that old sacred music splendid. Mercadante: seven last words.
  3722	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMozart’s twelfth mass: Gloria in that. Those old popes keen on music, on
  3723	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tart and statues and pictures of all kinds. Palestrina for example too.
  3724	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey had a gay old time while it lasted. Healthy too, chanting, regular
  3725	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thours, then brew liqueurs. Benedictine. Green Chartreuse. Still, having
  3726	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\teunuchs in their choir that was coming it a bit thick. What kind of
  3727	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvoice is it? Must be curious to hear after their own strong basses.
  3728	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tConnoisseurs. Suppose they wouldn’t feel anything after. Kind of a
  3729	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplacid. No worry. Fall into flesh, don’t they? Gluttons, tall, long
  3730	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlegs. Who knows? Eunuch. One way out of it.
  3731	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3732	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe saw the priest bend down and kiss the altar and then face about and
  3733	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbless all the people. All crossed themselves and stood up. Mr Bloom
  3734	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglanced about him and then stood up, looking over the risen hats. Stand
  3735	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tup at the gospel of course. Then all settled down on their knees again
  3736	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand he sat back quietly in his bench. The priest came down from the
  3737	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\taltar, holding the thing out from him, and he and the massboy answered
  3738	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\teach other in Latin. Then the priest knelt down and began to read off a
  3739	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcard:
  3740	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3741	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O God, our refuge and our strength...
  3742	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3743	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom put his face forward to catch the words. English. Throw them
  3744	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe bone. I remember slightly. How long since your last mass? Glorious
  3745	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand immaculate virgin. Joseph, her spouse. Peter and Paul. More
  3746	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinteresting if you understood what it was all about. Wonderful

  3748	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto. Then I will tell you all. Penance. Punish me, please. Great weapon
  3749	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin their hands. More than doctor or solicitor. Woman dying to. And I
  3750	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tschschschschschsch. And did you chachachachacha? And why did you? Look

  3752	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHusband learn to his surprise. God’s little joke. Then out she comes.
  3753	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRepentance skindeep. Lovely shame. Pray at an altar. Hail Mary and Holy

  3759	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMasses for the repose of my soul to be said publicly with open doors.
  3760	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMonasteries and convents. The priest in that Fermanagh will case in the

  3762	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLiberty and exaltation of our holy mother the church. The doctors of the

  3764	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3765	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe priest prayed:
  3766	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t

  3773	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe priest and the massboy stood up and walked off. All over. The women
  3774	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tremained behind: thanksgiving.

  3776	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBetter be shoving along. Brother Buzz. Come around with the plate
  3777	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tperhaps. Pay your Easter duty.
  3778	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3779	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe stood up. Hello. Were those two buttons of my waistcoat open all the
  3780	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttime? Women enjoy it. Never tell you. But we. Excuse, miss, there’s a
  3781	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t(whh!) just a (whh!) fluff. Or their skirt behind, placket unhooked.
  3782	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGlimpses of the moon. Annoyed if you don’t. Why didn’t you tell me
  3783	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbefore. Still like you better untidy. Good job it wasn’t farther south.
  3784	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe passed, discreetly buttoning, down the aisle and out through the main
  3785	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdoor into the light. He stood a moment unseeing by the cold black marble
  3786	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbowl while before him and behind two worshippers dipped furtive hands in
  3787	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe low tide of holy water. Trams: a car of Prescott’s dyeworks: a widow

  3789	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHow goes the time? Quarter past. Time enough yet. Better get that lotion
  3790	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmade up. Where is this? Ah yes, the last time. Sweny’s in Lincoln place.
  3791	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tChemists rarely move. Their green and gold beaconjars too heavy to stir.

  3797	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tO well, poor fellow, it’s not his fault. When was it I got it made up
  3798	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlast? Wait. I changed a sovereign I remember. First of the month it must

  3800	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3801	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe chemist turned back page after page. Sandy shrivelled smell he seems

  3809	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat picked an herb to cure himself had a bit of pluck. Simples. Want to
  3810	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbe careful. Enough stuff here to chloroform you. Test: turns blue
  3811	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlitmus paper red. Chloroform. Overdose of laudanum. Sleeping draughts.
  3812	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLovephiltres. Paragoric poppysyrup bad for cough. Clogs the pores or the

  3818	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, Mr Bloom said.
  3819	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3820	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe waited by the counter, inhaling slowly the keen reek of drugs, the
  3821	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdusty dry smell of sponges and loofahs. Lot of time taken up telling
  3822	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyour aches and pains.
  3823	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3824	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Sweet almond oil and tincture of benzoin, Mr Bloom said, and then
  3825	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\torangeflower water...
  3826	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3827	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIt certainly did make her skin so delicate white like wax.
  3828	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3829	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And white wax also, he said.
  3830	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3831	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBrings out the darkness of her eyes. Looking at me, the sheet up to
  3832	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther eyes, Spanish, smelling herself, when I was fixing the links in my
  3833	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcuffs. Those homely recipes are often the best: strawberries for the
  3834	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tteeth: nettles and rainwater: oatmeal they say steeped in buttermilk.
  3835	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSkinfood. One of the old queen’s sons, duke of Albany was it? had only
  3836	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tone skin. Leopold, yes. Three we have. Warts, bunions and pimples to
  3837	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmake it worse. But you want a perfume too. What perfume does your? Peau
  3838	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\td’Espagne. That orangeflower water is so fresh. Nice smell these soaps
  3839	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thave. Pure curd soap. Time to get a bath round the corner. Hammam.
  3840	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTurkish. Massage. Dirt gets rolled up in your navel. Nicer if a nice
  3841	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgirl did it. Also I think I. Yes I. Do it in the bath. Curious longing
  3842	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI. Water to water. Combine business with pleasure. Pity no time for
  3843	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmassage. Feel fresh then all the day. Funeral be rather glum.
  3844	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3845	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, sir, the chemist said. That was two and nine. Have you brought a
  3846	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbottle?
  3847	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3848	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—No, Mr Bloom said. Make it up, please. I’ll call later in the day and
  3849	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI’ll take one of these soaps. How much are they?
  3850	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3851	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Fourpence, sir.
  3852	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3853	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom raised a cake to his nostrils. Sweet lemony wax.
  3854	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3855	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I’ll take this one, he said. That makes three and a penny.
  3856	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3857	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, sir, the chemist said. You can pay all together, sir, when you
  3858	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcome back.
  3859	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3860	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Good, Mr Bloom said.
  3861	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3862	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe strolled out of the shop, the newspaper baton under his armpit, the
  3863	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcoolwrappered soap in his left hand.
  3864	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3865	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAt his armpit Bantam Lyons’ voice and hand said:
  3866	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3867	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Hello, Bloom. What’s the best news? Is that today’s? Show us a minute.
  3868	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3869	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShaved off his moustache again, by Jove! Long cold upper lip. To look
  3870	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyounger. He does look balmy. Younger than I am.
  3871	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3872	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBantam Lyons’s yellow blacknailed fingers unrolled the baton. Wants a
  3873	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twash too. Take off the rough dirt. Good morning, have you used Pears’
  3874	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsoap? Dandruff on his shoulders. Scalp wants oiling.
  3875	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3876	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I want to see about that French horse that’s running today, Bantam
  3877	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLyons said. Where the bugger is it?
  3878	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3879	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe rustled the pleated pages, jerking his chin on his high collar.
  3880	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBarber’s itch. Tight collar he’ll lose his hair. Better leave him the
  3881	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpaper and get shut of him.
  3882	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3883	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You can keep it, Mr Bloom said.
  3884	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3885	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ascot. Gold cup. Wait, Bantam Lyons muttered. Half a mo. Maximum the
  3886	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsecond.
  3887	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3888	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I was just going to throw it away, Mr Bloom said.
  3889	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3890	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBantam Lyons raised his eyes suddenly and leered weakly.
  3891	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3892	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What’s that? his sharp voice said.
  3893	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3894	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I say you can keep it, Mr Bloom answered. I was going to throw it away
  3895	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat moment.
  3896	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3897	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBantam Lyons doubted an instant, leering: then thrust the outspread
  3898	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsheets back on Mr Bloom’s arms.
  3899	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3900	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I’ll risk it, he said. Here, thanks.
  3901	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3902	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe sped off towards Conway’s corner. God speed scut.
  3903	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3904	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom folded the sheets again to a neat square and lodged the soap
  3905	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin it, smiling. Silly lips of that chap. Betting. Regular hotbed of it
  3906	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlately. Messenger boys stealing to put on sixpence. Raffle for large
  3907	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttender turkey. Your Christmas dinner for threepence. Jack Fleming

  3910	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3911	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe walked cheerfully towards the mosque of the baths. Remind you of a
  3912	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmosque, redbaked bricks, the minarets. College sports today I see. He
  3913	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\teyed the horseshoe poster over the gate of college park: cyclist doubled
  3914	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tup like a cod in a pot. Damn bad ad. Now if they had made it round
  3915	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlike a wheel. Then the spokes: sports, sports, sports: and the hub big:
  3916	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcollege. Something to catch the eye.
  3917	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3918	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThere’s Hornblower standing at the porter’s lodge. Keep him on hands:

  3922	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHeavenly weather really. If life was always like that. Cricket weather.
  3923	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSit around under sunshades. Over after over. Out. They can’t play it
  3924	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\there. Duck for six wickets. Still Captain Culler broke a window in the
  3925	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKildare street club with a slog to square leg. Donnybrook fair more
  3926	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin their line. And the skulls we were acracking when M’Carthy took the
  3927	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfloor. Heatwave. Won’t last. Always passing, the stream of life, which
  3928	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the stream of life we trace is dearer than them all.
  3929	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3930	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEnjoy a bath now: clean trough of water, cool enamel, the gentle tepid
  3931	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstream. This is my body.
  3932	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3933	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full, naked, in a womb of
  3934	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twarmth, oiled by scented melting soap, softly laved. He saw his
  3935	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttrunk and limbs riprippled over and sustained, buoyed lightly upward,
  3936	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlemonyellow: his navel, bud of flesh: and saw the dark tangled curls of
  3937	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this bush floating, floating hair of the stream around the limp father of
  3938	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthousands, a languid floating flower.
  3939	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3940	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3941	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3942	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3943	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3944	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t[ 6 ]
  3945	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3946	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMartin Cunningham, first, poked his silkhatted head into the creaking
  3947	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcarriage and, entering deftly, seated himself. Mr Power stepped in after
  3948	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim, curving his height with care.
  3949	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3950	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Come on, Simon.
  3951	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3952	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—After you, Mr Bloom said.
  3953	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3954	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Dedalus covered himself quickly and got in, saying:
  3955	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3956	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tYes, yes.
  3957	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3958	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Are we all here now? Martin Cunningham asked. Come along, Bloom.
  3959	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3960	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom entered and sat in the vacant place. He pulled the door to
  3961	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tafter him and slammed it twice till it shut tight. He passed an arm
  3962	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthrough the armstrap and looked seriously from the open carriagewindow
  3963	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat the lowered blinds of the avenue. One dragged aside: an old woman
  3964	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpeeping. Nose whiteflattened against the pane. Thanking her stars she
  3965	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas passed over. Extraordinary the interest they take in a corpse. Glad
  3966	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto see us go we give them such trouble coming. Job seems to suit them.
  3967	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHuggermugger in corners. Slop about in slipperslappers for fear he’d
  3968	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twake. Then getting it ready. Laying it out. Molly and Mrs Fleming making
  3969	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe bed. Pull it more to your side. Our windingsheet. Never know who
  3970	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twill touch you dead. Wash and shampoo. I believe they clip the nails and
  3971	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe hair. Keep a bit in an envelope. Grows all the same after. Unclean
  3972	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjob.
  3973	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3974	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAll waited. Nothing was said. Stowing in the wreaths probably. I am
  3975	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsitting on something hard. Ah, that soap: in my hip pocket. Better shift
  3976	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit out of that. Wait for an opportunity.
  3977	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3978	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAll waited. Then wheels were heard from in front, turning: then nearer:
  3979	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthen horses’ hoofs. A jolt. Their carriage began to move, creaking and
  3980	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tswaying. Other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind. The blinds of
  3981	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe avenue passed and number nine with its craped knocker, door ajar. At
  3982	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twalking pace.
  3983	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3984	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey waited still, their knees jogging, till they had turned and were
  3985	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpassing along the tramtracks. Tritonville road. Quicker. The wheels
  3986	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trattled rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook
  3987	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trattling in the doorframes.
  3988	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3989	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What way is he taking us? Mr Power asked through both windows.
  3990	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3991	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Irishtown, Martin Cunningham said. Ringsend. Brunswick street.
  3992	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3993	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Dedalus nodded, looking out.
  3994	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3995	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That’s a fine old custom, he said. I am glad to see it has not died
  3996	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout.
  3997	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  3998	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAll watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by
  3999	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpassers. Respect. The carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the
  4000	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsmoother road past Watery lane. Mr Bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man,
  4001	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tclad in mourning, a wide hat.
  4002	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4003	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—There’s a friend of yours gone by, Dedalus, he said.
  4004	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4005	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Who is that?
  4006	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4007	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Your son and heir.
  4008	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4009	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Where is he? Mr Dedalus said, stretching over across.
  4010	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4011	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe carriage, passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway
  4012	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbefore the tenement houses, lurched round the corner and, swerving back
  4013	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto the tramtrack, rolled on noisily with chattering wheels. Mr Dedalus
  4014	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfell back, saying:
  4015	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4016	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Was that Mulligan cad with him? His fidus Achates!
  4017	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4018	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—No, Mr Bloom said. He was alone.
  4019	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4020	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Down with his aunt Sally, I suppose, Mr Dedalus said, the Goulding
  4021	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfaction, the drunken little costdrawer and Crissie, papa’s little lump
  4022	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof dung, the wise child that knows her own father.
  4023	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4024	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom smiled joylessly on Ringsend road. Wallace Bros: the
  4025	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbottleworks: Dodder bridge.
  4026	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4027	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRichie Goulding and the legal bag. Goulding, Collis and Ward he calls
  4028	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe firm. His jokes are getting a bit damp. Great card he was. Waltzing
  4029	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin Stamer street with Ignatius Gallaher on a Sunday morning, the
  4030	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlandlady’s two hats pinned on his head. Out on the rampage all night.
  4031	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBeginning to tell on him now: that backache of his, I fear. Wife ironing
  4032	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this back. Thinks he’ll cure it with pills. All breadcrumbs they are.
  4033	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAbout six hundred per cent profit.
  4034	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4035	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—He’s in with a lowdown crowd, Mr Dedalus snarled. That Mulligan is a
  4036	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcontaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts. His name stinks
  4037	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall over Dublin. But with the help of God and His blessed mother I’ll
  4038	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmake it my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother
  4039	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tor his aunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a gate.
  4040	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI’ll tickle his catastrophe, believe you me.
  4041	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4042	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe cried above the clatter of the wheels:
  4043	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4044	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I won’t have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son. A counterjumper’s
  4045	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tson. Selling tapes in my cousin, Peter Paul M’Swiney’s. Not likely.
  4046	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4047	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe ceased. Mr Bloom glanced from his angry moustache to Mr Power’s mild
  4048	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tface and Martin Cunningham’s eyes and beard, gravely shaking. Noisy
  4049	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tselfwilled man. Full of his son. He is right. Something to hand on. If
  4050	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlittle Rudy had lived. See him grow up. Hear his voice in the house.
  4051	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWalking beside Molly in an Eton suit. My son. Me in his eyes. Strange
  4052	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfeeling it would be. From me. Just a chance. Must have been that morning
  4053	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin Raymond terrace she was at the window watching the two dogs at it by
  4054	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe wall of the cease to do evil. And the sergeant grinning up. She had
  4055	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat cream gown on with the rip she never stitched. Give us a touch,
  4056	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPoldy. God, I’m dying for it. How life begins.
  4057	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4058	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGot big then. Had to refuse the Greystones concert. My son inside her.
  4059	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI could have helped him on in life. I could. Make him independent. Learn
  4060	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGerman too.
  4061	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4062	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Are we late? Mr Power asked.
  4063	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4064	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ten minutes, Martin Cunningham said, looking at his watch.
  4065	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4066	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMolly. Milly. Same thing watered down. Her tomboy oaths. O jumping
  4067	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJupiter! Ye gods and little fishes! Still, she’s a dear girl. Soon be a
  4068	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twoman. Mullingar. Dearest Papli. Young student. Yes, yes: a woman too.
  4069	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLife, life.
  4070	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4071	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe carriage heeled over and back, their four trunks swaying.
  4072	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4073	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke, Mr Power said.
  4074	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4075	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—He might, Mr Dedalus said, if he hadn’t that squint troubling him. Do
  4076	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou follow me?
  4077	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4078	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe closed his left eye. Martin Cunningham began to brush away
  4079	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcrustcrumbs from under his thighs.
  4080	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4081	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What is this, he said, in the name of God? Crumbs?
  4082	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4083	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately, Mr Power
  4084	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaid.
  4085	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4086	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAll raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless
  4087	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tleather of the seats. Mr Dedalus, twisting his nose, frowned downward
  4088	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand said:
  4089	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4090	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Unless I’m greatly mistaken. What do you think, Martin?
  4091	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4092	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—It struck me too, Martin Cunningham said.
  4093	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4094	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom set his thigh down. Glad I took that bath. Feel my feet quite
  4095	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tclean. But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better.
  4096	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4097	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Dedalus sighed resignedly.
  4098	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4099	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—After all, he said, it’s the most natural thing in the world.
  4100	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4101	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Did Tom Kernan turn up? Martin Cunningham asked, twirling the peak of
  4102	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this beard gently.
  4103	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4104	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, Mr Bloom answered. He’s behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes.
  4105	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4106	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And Corny Kelleher himself? Mr Power asked.
  4107	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4108	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—At the cemetery, Martin Cunningham said.
  4109	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4110	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I met M’Coy this morning, Mr Bloom said. He said he’d try to come.
  4111	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4112	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe carriage halted short.
  4113	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4114	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What’s wrong?
  4115	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4116	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—We’re stopped.
  4117	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4118	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Where are we?
  4119	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4120	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom put his head out of the window.
  4121	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4122	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The grand canal, he said.
  4123	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4124	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGasworks. Whooping cough they say it cures. Good job Milly never got
  4125	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit. Poor children! Doubles them up black and blue in convulsions. Shame
  4126	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\treally. Got off lightly with illnesses compared. Only measles. Flaxseed
  4127	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttea. Scarlatina, influenza epidemics. Canvassing for death. Don’t miss
  4128	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthis chance. Dogs’ home over there. Poor old Athos! Be good to Athos,
  4129	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLeopold, is my last wish. Thy will be done. We obey them in the grave.
  4130	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA dying scrawl. He took it to heart, pined away. Quiet brute. Old men’s
  4131	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdogs usually are.
  4132	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4133	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA raindrop spat on his hat. He drew back and saw an instant of shower
  4134	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspray dots over the grey flags. Apart. Curious. Like through a colander.
  4135	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI thought it would. My boots were creaking I remember now.
  4136	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4137	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The weather is changing, he said quietly.
  4138	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4139	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—A pity it did not keep up fine, Martin Cunningham said.
  4140	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4141	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Wanted for the country, Mr Power said. There’s the sun again coming
  4142	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout.
  4143	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4144	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun, hurled a
  4145	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmute curse at the sky.
  4146	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4147	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—It’s as uncertain as a child’s bottom, he said.
  4148	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4149	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—We’re off again.
  4150	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4151	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed
  4152	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgently. Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard.
  4153	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4154	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Tom Kernan was immense last night, he said. And Paddy Leonard taking
  4155	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim off to his face.
  4156	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4157	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O, draw him out, Martin, Mr Power said eagerly. Wait till you hear him,
  4158	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSimon, on Ben Dollard’s singing of The Croppy Boy.
  4159	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4160	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Immense, Martin Cunningham said pompously. His singing of that simple
  4161	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tballad, Martin, is the most trenchant rendering I ever heard in the
  4162	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhole course of my experience.
  4163	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4164	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Trenchant, Mr Power said laughing. He’s dead nuts on that. And the
  4165	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tretrospective arrangement.
  4166	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4167	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Did you read Dan Dawson’s speech? Martin Cunningham asked.
  4168	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4169	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I did not then, Mr Dedalus said. Where is it?
  4170	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4171	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—In the paper this morning.
  4172	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4173	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket. That book I must change
  4174	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor her.
  4175	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4176	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—No, no, Mr Dedalus said quickly. Later on please.
  4177	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4178	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom’s glance travelled down the edge of the paper, scanning the
  4179	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdeaths: Callan, Coleman, Dignam, Fawcett, Lowry, Naumann, Peake, what
  4180	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPeake is that? is it the chap was in Crosbie and Alleyne’s? no, Sexton,
  4181	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tUrbright. Inked characters fast fading on the frayed breaking paper.
  4182	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThanks to the Little Flower. Sadly missed. To the inexpressible grief of
  4183	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this. Aged 88 after a long and tedious illness. Month’s mind: Quinlan. On
  4184	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhose soul Sweet Jesus have mercy.
  4185	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4186	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t      It is now a month since dear Henry fled
  4187	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t      To his home up above in the sky
  4188	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t      While his family weeps and mourns his loss
  4189	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t      Hoping some day to meet him on high.
  4190	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4191	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI tore up the envelope? Yes. Where did I put her letter after I read it
  4192	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the bath? He patted his waistcoatpocket. There all right. Dear Henry
  4193	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfled. Before my patience are exhausted.
  4194	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4195	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNational school. Meade’s yard. The hazard. Only two there now. Nodding.
  4196	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFull as a tick. Too much bone in their skulls. The other trotting round
  4197	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith a fare. An hour ago I was passing there. The jarvies raised their
  4198	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thats.
  4199	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4200	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA pointsman’s back straightened itself upright suddenly against a
  4201	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttramway standard by Mr Bloom’s window. Couldn’t they invent something
  4202	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tautomatic so that the wheel itself much handier? Well but that fellow
  4203	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould lose his job then? Well but then another fellow would get a job
  4204	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmaking the new invention?
  4205	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4206	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAntient concert rooms. Nothing on there. A man in a buff suit with a
  4207	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcrape armlet. Not much grief there. Quarter mourning. People in law
  4208	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tperhaps.
  4209	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4210	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey went past the bleak pulpit of saint Mark’s, under the railway
  4211	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbridge, past the Queen’s theatre: in silence. Hoardings: Eugene
  4212	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStratton, Mrs Bandmann Palmer. Could I go to see Leah tonight, I wonder.
  4213	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI said I. Or the Lily of Killarney? Elster Grimes Opera Company. Big
  4214	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpowerful change. Wet bright bills for next week. Fun on the Bristol.
  4215	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMartin Cunningham could work a pass for the Gaiety. Have to stand a
  4216	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdrink or two. As broad as it’s long.
  4217	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4218	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe’s coming in the afternoon. Her songs.
  4219	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4220	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPlasto’s. Sir Philip Crampton’s memorial fountain bust. Who was he?
  4221	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4222	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—How do you do? Martin Cunningham said, raising his palm to his brow in
  4223	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsalute.
  4224	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4225	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—He doesn’t see us, Mr Power said. Yes, he does. How do you do?
  4226	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4227	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Who? Mr Dedalus asked.
  4228	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4229	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Blazes Boylan, Mr Power said. There he is airing his quiff.
  4230	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4231	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJust that moment I was thinking.
  4232	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4233	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Dedalus bent across to salute. From the door of the Red Bank the
  4234	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhite disc of a straw hat flashed reply: spruce figure: passed.
  4235	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4236	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his right
  4237	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thand. The nails, yes. Is there anything more in him that they she sees?
  4238	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFascination. Worst man in Dublin. That keeps him alive. They sometimes
  4239	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfeel what a person is. Instinct. But a type like that. My nails. I
  4240	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tam just looking at them: well pared. And after: thinking alone. Body
  4241	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgetting a bit softy. I would notice that: from remembering. What causes
  4242	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat? I suppose the skin can’t contract quickly enough when the flesh
  4243	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfalls off. But the shape is there. The shape is there still. Shoulders.
  4244	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHips. Plump. Night of the dance dressing. Shift stuck between the cheeks
  4245	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbehind.
  4246	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4247	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe clasped his hands between his knees and, satisfied, sent his vacant
  4248	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglance over their faces.
  4249	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4250	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Power asked:
  4251	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4252	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—How is the concert tour getting on, Bloom?
  4253	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4254	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O, very well, Mr Bloom said. I hear great accounts of it. It’s a good
  4255	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tidea, you see...
  4256	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4257	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Are you going yourself?
  4258	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4259	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Well no, Mr Bloom said. In point of fact I have to go down to the
  4260	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcounty Clare on some private business. You see the idea is to tour the
  4261	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchief towns. What you lose on one you can make up on the other.
  4262	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4263	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Quite so, Martin Cunningham said. Mary Anderson is up there now.
  4264	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4265	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHave you good artists?
  4266	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4267	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Louis Werner is touring her, Mr Bloom said. O yes, we’ll have all
  4268	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttopnobbers. J. C. Doyle and John MacCormack I hope and. The best, in
  4269	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfact.
  4270	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4271	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And Madame, Mr Power said smiling. Last but not least.
  4272	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4273	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom unclasped his hands in a gesture of soft politeness and clasped
  4274	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem. Smith O’Brien. Someone has laid a bunch of flowers there. Woman.
  4275	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMust be his deathday. For many happy returns. The carriage wheeling by
  4276	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFarrell’s statue united noiselessly their unresisting knees.
  4277	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4278	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOot: a dullgarbed old man from the curbstone tendered his wares, his
  4279	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmouth opening: oot.
  4280	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4281	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Four bootlaces for a penny.
  4282	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4283	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWonder why he was struck off the rolls. Had his office in Hume street.
  4284	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSame house as Molly’s namesake, Tweedy, crown solicitor for Waterford.
  4285	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHas that silk hat ever since. Relics of old decency. Mourning too.
  4286	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTerrible comedown, poor wretch! Kicked about like snuff at a wake.
  4287	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tO’Callaghan on his last legs.
  4288	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4289	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd Madame. Twenty past eleven. Up. Mrs Fleming is in to clean. Doing
  4290	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther hair, humming: voglio e non vorrei. No: vorrei e non. Looking at
  4291	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe tips of her hairs to see if they are split. Mi trema un poco il.
  4292	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBeautiful on that tre her voice is: weeping tone. A thrush. A throstle.
  4293	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThere is a word throstle that expresses that.
  4294	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4295	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis eyes passed lightly over Mr Power’s goodlooking face. Greyish over
  4296	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe ears. Madame: smiling. I smiled back. A smile goes a long way. Only
  4297	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpoliteness perhaps. Nice fellow. Who knows is that true about the woman
  4298	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the keeps? Not pleasant for the wife. Yet they say, who was it told me,
  4299	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthere is no carnal. You would imagine that would get played out pretty
  4300	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tquick. Yes, it was Crofton met him one evening bringing her a pound of
  4301	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trumpsteak. What is this she was? Barmaid in Jury’s. Or the Moira, was
  4302	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit?
  4303	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4304	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey passed under the hugecloaked Liberator’s form.
  4305	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4306	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMartin Cunningham nudged Mr Power.
  4307	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4308	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Of the tribe of Reuben, he said.
  4309	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4310	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick, stumping round the corner
  4311	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof Elvery’s Elephant house, showed them a curved hand open on his spine.
  4312	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4313	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—In all his pristine beauty, Mr Power said.
  4314	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4315	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly:
  4316	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4317	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The devil break the hasp of your back!
  4318	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4319	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the window as the
  4320	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcarriage passed Gray’s statue.
  4321	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4322	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—We have all been there, Martin Cunningham said broadly.
  4323	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4324	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis eyes met Mr Bloom’s eyes. He caressed his beard, adding:
  4325	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4326	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Well, nearly all of us.
  4327	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4328	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions’ faces.
  4329	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4330	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That’s an awfully good one that’s going the rounds about Reuben J and
  4331	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe son.
  4332	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4333	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—About the boatman? Mr Power asked.
  4334	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4335	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes. Isn’t it awfully good?
  4336	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4337	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What is that? Mr Dedalus asked. I didn’t hear it.
  4338	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4339	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he determined to send
  4340	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim to the Isle of Man out of harm’s way but when they were both.....
  4341	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4342	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What? Mr Dedalus asked. That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it?
  4343	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4344	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, Mr Bloom said. They were both on the way to the boat and he tried
  4345	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto drown.....
  4346	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4347	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Drown Barabbas! Mr Dedalus cried. I wish to Christ he did!
  4348	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4349	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils.
  4350	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4351	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—No, Mr Bloom said, the son himself.....
  4352	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4353	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMartin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely:
  4354	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4355	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Reuben J and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on
  4356	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir way to the Isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got
  4357	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tloose and over the wall with him into the Liffey.
  4358	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4359	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—For God’s sake! Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright. Is he dead?
  4360	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4361	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Dead! Martin Cunningham cried. Not he! A boatman got a pole and fished
  4362	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father
  4363	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton the quay more dead than alive. Half the town was there.
  4364	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4365	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, Mr Bloom said. But the funny part is.....
  4366	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4367	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And Reuben J, Martin Cunningham said, gave the boatman a florin for
  4368	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaving his son’s life.
  4369	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4370	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA stifled sigh came from under Mr Power’s hand.
  4371	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4372	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O, he did, Martin Cunningham affirmed. Like a hero. A silver florin.
  4373	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4374	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Isn’t it awfully good? Mr Bloom said eagerly.
  4375	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4376	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—One and eightpence too much, Mr Dedalus said drily.
  4377	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4378	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Power’s choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage.
  4379	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4380	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNelson’s pillar.
  4381	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4382	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Eight plums a penny! Eight for a penny!
  4383	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4384	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—We had better look a little serious, Martin Cunningham said.
  4385	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4386	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Dedalus sighed.
  4387	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4388	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ah then indeed, he said, poor little Paddy wouldn’t grudge us a laugh.
  4389	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMany a good one he told himself.
  4390	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4391	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The Lord forgive me! Mr Power said, wiping his wet eyes with his
  4392	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfingers. Poor Paddy! I little thought a week ago when I saw him last and
  4393	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the was in his usual health that I’d be driving after him like this. He’s
  4394	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgone from us.
  4395	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4396	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—As decent a little man as ever wore a hat, Mr Dedalus said. He went
  4397	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvery suddenly.
  4398	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4399	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Breakdown, Martin Cunningham said. Heart.
  4400	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4401	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe tapped his chest sadly.
  4402	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4403	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBlazing face: redhot. Too much John Barleycorn. Cure for a red nose.
  4404	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDrink like the devil till it turns adelite. A lot of money he spent
  4405	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcolouring it.
  4406	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4407	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension.
  4408	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4409	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—He had a sudden death, poor fellow, he said.
  4410	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4411	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The best death, Mr Bloom said.
  4412	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4413	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTheir wide open eyes looked at him.
  4414	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4415	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—No suffering, he said. A moment and all is over. Like dying in sleep.
  4416	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4417	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNo-one spoke.
  4418	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4419	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDead side of the street this. Dull business by day, land agents,
  4420	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttemperance hotel, Falconer’s railway guide, civil service college,
  4421	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGill’s, catholic club, the industrious blind. Why? Some reason. Sun or
  4422	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twind. At night too. Chummies and slaveys. Under the patronage of the
  4423	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlate Father Mathew. Foundation stone for Parnell. Breakdown. Heart.
  4424	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4425	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhite horses with white frontlet plumes came round the Rotunda corner,
  4426	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgalloping. A tiny coffin flashed by. In a hurry to bury. A mourning
  4427	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcoach. Unmarried. Black for the married. Piebald for bachelors. Dun for
  4428	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta nun.
  4429	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4430	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Sad, Martin Cunningham said. A child.
  4431	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4432	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA dwarf’s face, mauve and wrinkled like little Rudy’s was. Dwarf’s body,
  4433	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tweak as putty, in a whitelined deal box. Burial friendly society
  4434	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpays. Penny a week for a sod of turf. Our. Little. Beggar. Baby. Meant
  4435	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnothing. Mistake of nature. If it’s healthy it’s from the mother. If not
  4436	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom the man. Better luck next time.
  4437	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4438	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Poor little thing, Mr Dedalus said. It’s well out of it.
  4439	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4440	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe carriage climbed more slowly the hill of Rutland square. Rattle his
  4441	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbones. Over the stones. Only a pauper. Nobody owns.
  4442	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4443	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—In the midst of life, Martin Cunningham said.
  4444	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4445	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—But the worst of all, Mr Power said, is the man who takes his own life.
  4446	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4447	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMartin Cunningham drew out his watch briskly, coughed and put it back.
  4448	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4449	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The greatest disgrace to have in the family, Mr Power added.
  4450	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4451	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Temporary insanity, of course, Martin Cunningham said decisively. We
  4452	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmust take a charitable view of it.
  4453	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4454	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—They say a man who does it is a coward, Mr Dedalus said.
  4455	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4456	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—It is not for us to judge, Martin Cunningham said.
  4457	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4458	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom, about to speak, closed his lips again. Martin Cunningham’s
  4459	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlarge eyes. Looking away now. Sympathetic human man he is. Intelligent.
  4460	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLike Shakespeare’s face. Always a good word to say. They have no mercy
  4461	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton that here or infanticide. Refuse christian burial. They used to drive
  4462	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta stake of wood through his heart in the grave. As if it wasn’t broken
  4463	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\talready. Yet sometimes they repent too late. Found in the riverbed
  4464	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tclutching rushes. He looked at me. And that awful drunkard of a wife
  4465	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof his. Setting up house for her time after time and then pawning the
  4466	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfurniture on him every Saturday almost. Leading him the life of the
  4467	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdamned. Wear the heart out of a stone, that. Monday morning. Start
  4468	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tafresh. Shoulder to the wheel. Lord, she must have looked a sight
  4469	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat night Dedalus told me he was in there. Drunk about the place and
  4470	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcapering with Martin’s umbrella.
  4471	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4472	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     And they call me the jewel of Asia,
  4473	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     Of Asia,
  4474	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     The geisha.
  4475	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4476	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe looked away from me. He knows. Rattle his bones.
  4477	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4478	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThat afternoon of the inquest. The redlabelled bottle on the table. The
  4479	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\troom in the hotel with hunting pictures. Stuffy it was. Sunlight through
  4480	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe slats of the Venetian blind. The coroner’s sunlit ears, big and
  4481	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thairy. Boots giving evidence. Thought he was asleep first. Then saw like
  4482	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyellow streaks on his face. Had slipped down to the foot of the bed.
  4483	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tVerdict: overdose. Death by misadventure. The letter. For my son
  4484	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLeopold.
  4485	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4486	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNo more pain. Wake no more. Nobody owns.
  4487	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4488	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe carriage rattled swiftly along Blessington street. Over the stones.
  4489	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4490	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—We are going the pace, I think, Martin Cunningham said.
  4491	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4492	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—God grant he doesn’t upset us on the road, Mr Power said.
  4493	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4494	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I hope not, Martin Cunningham said. That will be a great race tomorrow
  4495	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin Germany. The Gordon Bennett.
  4496	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4497	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, by Jove, Mr Dedalus said. That will be worth seeing, faith.
  4498	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4499	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAs they turned into Berkeley street a streetorgan near the Basin sent
  4500	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tover and after them a rollicking rattling song of the halls. Has anybody
  4501	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\there seen Kelly? Kay ee double ell wy. Dead March from Saul. He’s as
  4502	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbad as old Antonio. He left me on my ownio. Pirouette! The Mater
  4503	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMisericordiae. Eccles street. My house down there. Big place. Ward for
  4504	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tincurables there. Very encouraging. Our Lady’s Hospice for the dying.
  4505	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDeadhouse handy underneath. Where old Mrs Riordan died. They look
  4506	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tterrible the women. Her feeding cup and rubbing her mouth with the
  4507	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspoon. Then the screen round her bed for her to die. Nice young student
  4508	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat was dressed that bite the bee gave me. He’s gone over to the
  4509	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlying-in hospital they told me. From one extreme to the other.
  4510	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4511	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe carriage galloped round a corner: stopped.
  4512	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4513	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What’s wrong now?
  4514	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4515	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows, lowing, slouching
  4516	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby on padded hoofs, whisking their tails slowly on their clotted bony
  4517	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcroups. Outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleating their
  4518	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfear.
  4519	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4520	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Emigrants, Mr Power said.
  4521	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4522	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Huuuh! the drover’s voice cried, his switch sounding on their flanks.
  4523	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHuuuh! out of that!
  4524	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4525	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThursday, of course. Tomorrow is killing day. Springers. Cuffe sold them
  4526	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabout twentyseven quid each. For Liverpool probably. Roastbeef for old
  4527	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEngland. They buy up all the juicy ones. And then the fifth quarter
  4528	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlost: all that raw stuff, hide, hair, horns. Comes to a big thing in a
  4529	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyear. Dead meat trade. Byproducts of the slaughterhouses for tanneries,
  4530	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsoap, margarine. Wonder if that dodge works now getting dicky meat off
  4531	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe train at Clonsilla.
  4532	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4533	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe carriage moved on through the drove.
  4534	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4535	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I can’t make out why the corporation doesn’t run a tramline from the
  4536	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tparkgate to the quays, Mr Bloom said. All those animals could be taken
  4537	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin trucks down to the boats.
  4538	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4539	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare, Martin Cunningham said. Quite
  4540	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tright. They ought to.
  4541	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4542	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, Mr Bloom said, and another thing I often thought, is to have
  4543	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmunicipal funeral trams like they have in Milan, you know. Run the line
  4544	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout to the cemetery gates and have special trams, hearse and carriage
  4545	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand all. Don’t you see what I mean?
  4546	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4547	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O, that be damned for a story, Mr Dedalus said. Pullman car and saloon
  4548	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdiningroom.
  4549	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4550	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—A poor lookout for Corny, Mr Power added.
  4551	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4552	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Why? Mr Bloom asked, turning to Mr Dedalus. Wouldn’t it be more decent
  4553	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthan galloping two abreast?
  4554	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4555	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Well, there’s something in that, Mr Dedalus granted.
  4556	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4557	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And, Martin Cunningham said, we wouldn’t have scenes like that when the
  4558	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thearse capsized round Dunphy’s and upset the coffin on to the road.
  4559	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4560	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That was terrible, Mr Power’s shocked face said, and the corpse fell
  4561	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabout the road. Terrible!
  4562	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4563	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—First round Dunphy’s, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. Gordon Bennett cup.
  4564	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4565	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Praises be to God! Martin Cunningham said piously.
  4566	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4567	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBom! Upset. A coffin bumped out on to the road. Burst open. Paddy Dignam
  4568	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshot out and rolling over stiff in the dust in a brown habit too large
  4569	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor him. Red face: grey now. Mouth fallen open. Asking what’s up now.
  4570	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tQuite right to close it. Looks horrid open. Then the insides decompose
  4571	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tquickly. Much better to close up all the orifices. Yes, also. With wax.
  4572	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe sphincter loose. Seal up all.
  4573	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4574	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Dunphy’s, Mr Power announced as the carriage turned right.
  4575	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4576	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDunphy’s corner. Mourning coaches drawn up, drowning their grief. A
  4577	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpause by the wayside. Tiptop position for a pub. Expect we’ll pull up
  4578	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\there on the way back to drink his health. Pass round the consolation.
  4579	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tElixir of life.
  4580	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4581	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut suppose now it did happen. Would he bleed if a nail say cut him
  4582	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the knocking about? He would and he wouldn’t, I suppose. Depends on
  4583	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhere. The circulation stops. Still some might ooze out of an artery. It
  4584	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould be better to bury them in red: a dark red.
  4585	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4586	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIn silence they drove along Phibsborough road. An empty hearse trotted
  4587	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby, coming from the cemetery: looks relieved.
  4588	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4589	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCrossguns bridge: the royal canal.
  4590	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4591	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWater rushed roaring through the sluices. A man stood on his
  4592	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdropping barge, between clamps of turf. On the towpath by the lock a
  4593	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tslacktethered horse. Aboard of the Bugabu.
  4594	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4595	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTheir eyes watched him. On the slow weedy waterway he had floated on his
  4596	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\traft coastward over Ireland drawn by a haulage rope past beds of
  4597	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\treeds, over slime, mudchoked bottles, carrion dogs. Athlone, Mullingar,
  4598	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMoyvalley, I could make a walking tour to see Milly by the canal. Or
  4599	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcycle down. Hire some old crock, safety. Wren had one the other day at
  4600	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe auction but a lady’s. Developing waterways. James M’Cann’s hobby
  4601	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto row me o’er the ferry. Cheaper transit. By easy stages. Houseboats.
  4602	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCamping out. Also hearses. To heaven by water. Perhaps I will without
  4603	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twriting. Come as a surprise, Leixlip, Clonsilla. Dropping down lock by
  4604	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlock to Dublin. With turf from the midland bogs. Salute. He lifted his
  4605	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrown straw hat, saluting Paddy Dignam.
  4606	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4607	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey drove on past Brian Boroimhe house. Near it now.
  4608	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4609	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I wonder how is our friend Fogarty getting on, Mr Power said.
  4610	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4611	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Better ask Tom Kernan, Mr Dedalus said.
  4612	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4613	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—How is that? Martin Cunningham said. Left him weeping, I suppose?
  4614	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4615	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Though lost to sight, Mr Dedalus said, to memory dear.
  4616	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4617	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe carriage steered left for Finglas road.
  4618	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4619	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe stonecutter’s yard on the right. Last lap. Crowded on the spit of
  4620	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tland silent shapes appeared, white, sorrowful, holding out calm hands,
  4621	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknelt in grief, pointing. Fragments of shapes, hewn. In white silence:
  4622	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tappealing. The best obtainable. Thos. H. Dennany, monumental builder and
  4623	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsculptor.
  4624	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4625	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPassed.
  4626	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4627	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOn the curbstone before Jimmy Geary, the sexton’s, an old tramp sat,
  4628	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgrumbling, emptying the dirt and stones out of his huge dustbrown
  4629	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyawning boot. After life’s journey.
  4630	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4631	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGloomy gardens then went by: one by one: gloomy houses.
  4632	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4633	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Power pointed.
  4634	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4635	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That is where Childs was murdered, he said. The last house.
  4636	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4637	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—So it is, Mr Dedalus said. A gruesome case. Seymour Bushe got him off.
  4638	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMurdered his brother. Or so they said.
  4639	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4640	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The crown had no evidence, Mr Power said.
  4641	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4642	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Only circumstantial, Martin Cunningham added. That’s the maxim of the
  4643	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlaw. Better for ninetynine guilty to escape than for one innocent person
  4644	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto be wrongfully condemned.
  4645	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4646	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey looked. Murderer’s ground. It passed darkly. Shuttered, tenantless,
  4647	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunweeded garden. Whole place gone to hell. Wrongfully condemned. Murder.
  4648	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe murderer’s image in the eye of the murdered. They love reading about
  4649	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit. Man’s head found in a garden. Her clothing consisted of. How she met
  4650	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther death. Recent outrage. The weapon used. Murderer is still at large.
  4651	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tClues. A shoelace. The body to be exhumed. Murder will out.
  4652	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4653	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCramped in this carriage. She mightn’t like me to come that way without
  4654	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tletting her know. Must be careful about women. Catch them once with
  4655	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir pants down. Never forgive you after. Fifteen.
  4656	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4657	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe high railings of Prospect rippled past their gaze. Dark poplars,
  4658	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trare white forms. Forms more frequent, white shapes thronged amid the
  4659	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttrees, white forms and fragments streaming by mutely, sustaining vain
  4660	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgestures on the air.
  4661	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4662	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe felly harshed against the curbstone: stopped. Martin Cunningham put
  4663	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout his arm and, wrenching back the handle, shoved the door open with
  4664	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this knee. He stepped out. Mr Power and Mr Dedalus followed.
  4665	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4666	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tChange that soap now. Mr Bloom’s hand unbuttoned his hip pocket swiftly
  4667	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand transferred the paperstuck soap to his inner handkerchief pocket.
  4668	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe stepped out of the carriage, replacing the newspaper his other hand
  4669	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstill held.
  4670	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4671	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPaltry funeral: coach and three carriages. It’s all the same.
  4672	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPallbearers, gold reins, requiem mass, firing a volley. Pomp of death.
  4673	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBeyond the hind carriage a hawker stood by his barrow of cakes and
  4674	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfruit. Simnel cakes those are, stuck together: cakes for the dead.
  4675	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDogbiscuits. Who ate them? Mourners coming out.
  4676	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4677	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe followed his companions. Mr Kernan and Ned Lambert followed, Hynes
  4678	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twalking after them. Corny Kelleher stood by the opened hearse and took
  4679	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout the two wreaths. He handed one to the boy.
  4680	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4681	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhere is that child’s funeral disappeared to?
  4682	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4683	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA team of horses passed from Finglas with toiling plodding tread,
  4684	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdragging through the funereal silence a creaking waggon on which lay a
  4685	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgranite block. The waggoner marching at their head saluted.
  4686	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4687	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCoffin now. Got here before us, dead as he is. Horse looking round at it
  4688	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith his plume skeowways. Dull eye: collar tight on his neck, pressing
  4689	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton a bloodvessel or something. Do they know what they cart out here
  4690	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tevery day? Must be twenty or thirty funerals every day. Then Mount
  4691	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJerome for the protestants. Funerals all over the world everywhere every
  4692	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tminute. Shovelling them under by the cartload doublequick. Thousands
  4693	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tevery hour. Too many in the world.
  4694	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4695	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMourners came out through the gates: woman and a girl. Leanjawed harpy,
  4696	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thard woman at a bargain, her bonnet awry. Girl’s face stained with dirt
  4697	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand tears, holding the woman’s arm, looking up at her for a sign to cry.
  4698	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFish’s face, bloodless and livid.
  4699	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4700	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe mutes shouldered the coffin and bore it in through the gates. So
  4701	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmuch dead weight. Felt heavier myself stepping out of that bath. First
  4702	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe stiff: then the friends of the stiff. Corny Kelleher and the
  4703	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tboy followed with their wreaths. Who is that beside them? Ah, the
  4704	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrother-in-law.
  4705	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4706	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAll walked after.
  4707	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4708	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMartin Cunningham whispered:
  4709	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4710	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I was in mortal agony with you talking of suicide before Bloom.
  4711	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4712	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What? Mr Power whispered. How so?
  4713	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4714	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—His father poisoned himself, Martin Cunningham whispered. Had the
  4715	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tQueen’s hotel in Ennis. You heard him say he was going to Clare.
  4716	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnniversary.
  4717	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4718	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O God! Mr Power whispered. First I heard of it. Poisoned himself?
  4719	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4720	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyes followed
  4721	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttowards the cardinal’s mausoleum. Speaking.
  4722	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4723	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Was he insured? Mr Bloom asked.
  4724	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4725	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I believe so, Mr Kernan answered. But the policy was heavily mortgaged.
  4726	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMartin is trying to get the youngster into Artane.
  4727	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4728	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—How many children did he leave?
  4729	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4730	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Five. Ned Lambert says he’ll try to get one of the girls into Todd’s.
  4731	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4732	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—A sad case, Mr Bloom said gently. Five young children.
  4733	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4734	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—A great blow to the poor wife, Mr Kernan added.
  4735	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4736	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Indeed yes, Mr Bloom agreed.
  4737	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4738	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHas the laugh at him now.
  4739	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4740	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished. She had
  4741	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\toutlived him. Lost her husband. More dead for her than for me. One must
  4742	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\toutlive the other. Wise men say. There are more women than men in the
  4743	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tworld. Condole with her. Your terrible loss. I hope you’ll soon follow
  4744	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim. For Hindu widows only. She would marry another. Him? No. Yet who
  4745	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknows after. Widowhood not the thing since the old queen died. Drawn on
  4746	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta guncarriage. Victoria and Albert. Frogmore memorial mourning. But
  4747	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the end she put a few violets in her bonnet. Vain in her heart of
  4748	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thearts. All for a shadow. Consort not even a king. Her son was the
  4749	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsubstance. Something new to hope for not like the past she wanted back,
  4750	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twaiting. It never comes. One must go first: alone, under the ground: and
  4751	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlie no more in her warm bed.
  4752	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4753	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—How are you, Simon? Ned Lambert said softly, clasping hands. Haven’t
  4754	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseen you for a month of Sundays.
  4755	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4756	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Never better. How are all in Cork’s own town?
  4757	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4758	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I was down there for the Cork park races on Easter Monday, Ned Lambert
  4759	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaid. Same old six and eightpence. Stopped with Dick Tivy.
  4760	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4761	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And how is Dick, the solid man?
  4762	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4763	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Nothing between himself and heaven, Ned Lambert answered.
  4764	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4765	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—By the holy Paul! Mr Dedalus said in subdued wonder. Dick Tivy bald?
  4766	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4767	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters, Ned Lambert said,
  4768	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpointing ahead. A few bob a skull. Just to keep them going till the
  4769	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinsurance is cleared up.
  4770	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4771	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, yes, Mr Dedalus said dubiously. Is that the eldest boy in front?
  4772	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4773	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, Ned Lambert said, with the wife’s brother. John Henry Menton is
  4774	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbehind. He put down his name for a quid.
  4775	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4776	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I’ll engage he did, Mr Dedalus said. I often told poor Paddy he ought
  4777	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto mind that job. John Henry is not the worst in the world.
  4778	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4779	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—How did he lose it? Ned Lambert asked. Liquor, what?
  4780	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4781	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Many a good man’s fault, Mr Dedalus said with a sigh.
  4782	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4783	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey halted about the door of the mortuary chapel. Mr Bloom stood behind
  4784	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair and at the
  4785	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tslender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar. Poor boy! Was he there
  4786	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhen the father? Both unconscious. Lighten up at the last moment
  4787	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand recognise for the last time. All he might have done. I owe three
  4788	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshillings to O’Grady. Would he understand? The mutes bore the coffin
  4789	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinto the chapel. Which end is his head?
  4790	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4791	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAfter a moment he followed the others in, blinking in the screened
  4792	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlight. The coffin lay on its bier before the chancel, four tall yellow
  4793	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcandles at its corners. Always in front of us. Corny Kelleher, laying a
  4794	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twreath at each fore corner, beckoned to the boy to kneel. The mourners
  4795	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknelt here and there in prayingdesks. Mr Bloom stood behind near the
  4796	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfont and, when all had knelt, dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper
  4797	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it. He fitted his black
  4798	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\that gently on his left knee and, holding its brim, bent over piously.
  4799	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4800	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through a
  4801	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdoor. The whitesmocked priest came after him, tidying his stole with one
  4802	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thand, balancing with the other a little book against his toad’s belly.
  4803	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWho’ll read the book? I, said the rook.
  4804	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4805	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book
  4806	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith a fluent croak.
  4807	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4808	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFather Coffey. I knew his name was like a coffin. Dominenamine. Bully
  4809	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabout the muzzle he looks. Bosses the show. Muscular christian. Woe
  4810	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbetide anyone that looks crooked at him: priest. Thou art Peter. Burst
  4811	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsideways like a sheep in clover Dedalus says he will. With a belly on
  4812	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim like a poisoned pup. Most amusing expressions that man finds. Hhhn:
  4813	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tburst sideways.
  4814	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4815	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Non intres in judicium cum servo tuo, Domine.
  4816	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4817	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMakes them feel more important to be prayed over in Latin. Requiem mass.
  4818	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCrape weepers. Blackedged notepaper. Your name on the altarlist. Chilly
  4819	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplace this. Want to feed well, sitting in there all the morning in the
  4820	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgloom kicking his heels waiting for the next please. Eyes of a toad too.
  4821	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhat swells him up that way? Molly gets swelled after cabbage. Air of
  4822	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe place maybe. Looks full up of bad gas. Must be an infernal lot
  4823	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof bad gas round the place. Butchers, for instance: they get like raw
  4824	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeefsteaks. Who was telling me? Mervyn Browne. Down in the vaults of
  4825	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaint Werburgh’s lovely old organ hundred and fifty they have to bore a
  4826	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thole in the coffins sometimes to let out the bad gas and burn it. Out it
  4827	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trushes: blue. One whiff of that and you’re a goner.
  4828	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4829	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMy kneecap is hurting me. Ow. That’s better.
  4830	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4831	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy’s
  4832	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbucket and shook it over the coffin. Then he walked to the other end and
  4833	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshook it again. Then he came back and put it back in the bucket. As you
  4834	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere before you rested. It’s all written down: he has to do it.
  4835	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4836	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Et ne nos inducas in tentationem.
  4837	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4838	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe server piped the answers in the treble. I often thought it would be
  4839	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbetter to have boy servants. Up to fifteen or so. After that, of course
  4840	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t...
  4841	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4842	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHoly water that was, I expect. Shaking sleep out of it. He must be fed
  4843	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tup with that job, shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up.
  4844	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhat harm if he could see what he was shaking it over. Every mortal
  4845	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tday a fresh batch: middleaged men, old women, children, women dead in
  4846	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchildbirth, men with beards, baldheaded businessmen, consumptive girls
  4847	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith little sparrows’ breasts. All the year round he prayed the same
  4848	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthing over them all and shook water on top of them: sleep. On Dignam
  4849	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnow.
  4850	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4851	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—In paradisum.
  4852	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4853	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSaid he was going to paradise or is in paradise. Says that over
  4854	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\teverybody. Tiresome kind of a job. But he has to say something.
  4855	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4856	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe priest closed his book and went off, followed by the server. Corny
  4857	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in, hoisted the
  4858	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcoffin again, carried it out and shoved it on their cart. Corny Kelleher
  4859	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother-in-law. All followed
  4860	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air. Mr Bloom came last
  4861	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfolding his paper again into his pocket. He gazed gravely at the ground
  4862	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttill the coffincart wheeled off to the left. The metal wheels ground the
  4863	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt boots followed the
  4864	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttrundled barrow along a lane of sepulchres.
  4865	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4866	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe ree the ra the ree the ra the roo. Lord, I mustn’t lilt here.
  4867	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4868	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The O’Connell circle, Mr Dedalus said about him.
  4869	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4870	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Power’s soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone.
  4871	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4872	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—He’s at rest, he said, in the middle of his people, old Dan O’. But his
  4873	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\theart is buried in Rome. How many broken hearts are buried here, Simon!
  4874	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4875	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Her grave is over there, Jack, Mr Dedalus said. I’ll soon be stretched
  4876	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeside her. Let Him take me whenever He likes.
  4877	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4878	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBreaking down, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a little
  4879	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin his walk. Mr Power took his arm.
  4880	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4881	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—She’s better where she is, he said kindly.
  4882	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4883	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I suppose so, Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp. I suppose she is in
  4884	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\theaven if there is a heaven.
  4885	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4886	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCorny Kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to
  4887	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplod by.
  4888	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4889	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Sad occasions, Mr Kernan began politely.
  4890	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4891	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head.
  4892	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4893	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The others are putting on their hats, Mr Kernan said. I suppose we can
  4894	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdo so too. We are the last. This cemetery is a treacherous place.
  4895	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4896	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey covered their heads.
  4897	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4898	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly, don’t you think?
  4899	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Kernan said with reproof.
  4900	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4901	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot eyes. Secret
  4902	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\teyes, secretsearching. Mason, I think: not sure. Beside him again. We
  4903	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tare the last. In the same boat. Hope he’ll say something else.
  4904	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4905	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Kernan added:
  4906	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4907	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The service of the Irish church used in Mount Jerome is simpler, more
  4908	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\timpressive I must say.
  4909	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4910	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom gave prudent assent. The language of course was another thing.
  4911	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4912	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Kernan said with solemnity:
  4913	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4914	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I am the resurrection and the life. That touches a man’s inmost heart.
  4915	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4916	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—It does, Mr Bloom said.
  4917	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4918	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tYour heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two
  4919	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith his toes to the daisies? No touching that. Seat of the affections.
  4920	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBroken heart. A pump after all, pumping thousands of gallons of blood
  4921	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tevery day. One fine day it gets bunged up: and there you are. Lots of
  4922	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem lying around here: lungs, hearts, livers. Old rusty pumps: damn
  4923	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe thing else. The resurrection and the life. Once you are dead you are
  4924	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdead. That last day idea. Knocking them all up out of their graves. Come
  4925	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tforth, Lazarus! And he came fifth and lost the job. Get up! Last day!
  4926	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThen every fellow mousing around for his liver and his lights and the
  4927	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trest of his traps. Find damn all of himself that morning. Pennyweight of
  4928	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpowder in a skull. Twelve grammes one pennyweight. Troy measure.
  4929	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4930	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCorny Kelleher fell into step at their side.
  4931	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4932	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Everything went off A1, he said. What?
  4933	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4934	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe looked on them from his drawling eye. Policeman’s shoulders. With
  4935	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyour tooraloom tooraloom.
  4936	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4937	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—As it should be, Mr Kernan said.
  4938	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4939	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What? Eh? Corny Kelleher said.
  4940	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4941	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Kernan assured him.
  4942	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4943	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan? John Henry Menton asked. I
  4944	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknow his face.
  4945	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4946	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNed Lambert glanced back.
  4947	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4948	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Bloom, he said, Madame Marion Tweedy that was, is, I mean, the soprano.
  4949	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe’s his wife.
  4950	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4951	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O, to be sure, John Henry Menton said. I haven’t seen her for some
  4952	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttime. She was a finelooking woman. I danced with her, wait, fifteen
  4953	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseventeen golden years ago, at Mat Dillon’s in Roundtown. And a good
  4954	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tarmful she was.
  4955	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4956	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe looked behind through the others.
  4957	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4958	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What is he? he asked. What does he do? Wasn’t he in the stationery
  4959	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tline? I fell foul of him one evening, I remember, at bowls.
  4960	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4961	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNed Lambert smiled.
  4962	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4963	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, he was, he said, in Wisdom Hely’s. A traveller for blottingpaper.
  4964	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4965	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—In God’s name, John Henry Menton said, what did she marry a coon like
  4966	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat for? She had plenty of game in her then.
  4967	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4968	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Has still, Ned Lambert said. He does some canvassing for ads.
  4969	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4970	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJohn Henry Menton’s large eyes stared ahead.
  4971	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4972	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe barrow turned into a side lane. A portly man, ambushed among the
  4973	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgrasses, raised his hat in homage. The gravediggers touched their caps.
  4974	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4975	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—John O’Connell, Mr Power said pleased. He never forgets a friend.
  4976	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4977	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr O’Connell shook all their hands in silence. Mr Dedalus said:
  4978	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4979	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I am come to pay you another visit.
  4980	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4981	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—My dear Simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice. I don’t want your
  4982	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcustom at all.
  4983	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4984	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSaluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin
  4985	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCunningham’s side puzzling two long keys at his back.
  4986	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4987	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Did you hear that one, he asked them, about Mulcahy from the Coombe?
  4988	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4989	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I did not, Martin Cunningham said.
  4990	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4991	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear. The
  4992	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcaretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke
  4993	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin a discreet tone to their vacant smiles.
  4994	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  4995	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—They tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out here one foggy
  4996	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tevening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs. They asked for
  4997	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried. After
  4998	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttraipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough. One of the
  4999	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdrunks spelt out the name: Terence Mulcahy. The other drunk was blinking
  5000	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tup at a statue of Our Saviour the widow had got put up.
  5001	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5002	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed. He
  5003	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tresumed:
  5004	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5005	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And, after blinking up at the sacred figure, Not a bloody bit like the
  5006	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tman, says he. That’s not Mulcahy, says he, whoever done it.
  5007	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5008	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher, accepting
  5009	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as he walked.
  5010	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5011	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That’s all done with a purpose, Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes.
  5012	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5013	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I know, Hynes said. I know that.
  5014	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5015	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—To cheer a fellow up, Martin Cunningham said. It’s pure
  5016	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgoodheartedness: damn the thing else.
  5017	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5018	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom admired the caretaker’s prosperous bulk. All want to be on good
  5019	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tterms with him. Decent fellow, John O’Connell, real good sort. Keys:
  5020	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlike Keyes’s ad: no fear of anyone getting out. No passout checks.
  5021	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHabeas corpus. I must see about that ad after the funeral. Did I write
  5022	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBallsbridge on the envelope I took to cover when she disturbed me
  5023	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twriting to Martha? Hope it’s not chucked in the dead letter office. Be
  5024	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe better of a shave. Grey sprouting beard. That’s the first sign when
  5025	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe hairs come out grey. And temper getting cross. Silver threads among
  5026	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe grey. Fancy being his wife. Wonder he had the gumption to propose to
  5027	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tany girl. Come out and live in the graveyard. Dangle that before her.
  5028	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIt might thrill her first. Courting death. Shades of night hovering
  5029	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\there with all the dead stretched about. The shadows of the tombs when
  5030	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchurchyards yawn and Daniel O’Connell must be a descendant I suppose
  5031	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twho is this used to say he was a queer breedy man great catholic all the
  5032	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsame like a big giant in the dark. Will o’ the wisp. Gas of graves.
  5033	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWant to keep her mind off it to conceive at all. Women especially are so
  5034	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttouchy. Tell her a ghost story in bed to make her sleep. Have you ever
  5035	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseen a ghost? Well, I have. It was a pitchdark night. The clock was on
  5036	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe stroke of twelve. Still they’d kiss all right if properly keyed up.
  5037	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhores in Turkish graveyards. Learn anything if taken young. You might
  5038	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpick up a young widow here. Men like that. Love among the tombstones.
  5039	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRomeo. Spice of pleasure. In the midst of death we are in life. Both
  5040	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tends meet. Tantalising for the poor dead. Smell of grilled beefsteaks to
  5041	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe starving. Gnawing their vitals. Desire to grig people. Molly wanting
  5042	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto do it at the window. Eight children he has anyway.
  5043	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5044	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe has seen a fair share go under in his time, lying around him field
  5045	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tafter field. Holy fields. More room if they buried them standing.
  5046	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSitting or kneeling you couldn’t. Standing? His head might come up some
  5047	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tday above ground in a landslip with his hand pointing. All honeycombed
  5048	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe ground must be: oblong cells. And very neat he keeps it too: trim
  5049	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgrass and edgings. His garden Major Gamble calls Mount Jerome. Well,
  5050	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tso it is. Ought to be flowers of sleep. Chinese cemeteries with giant
  5051	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpoppies growing produce the best opium Mastiansky told me. The Botanic
  5052	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGardens are just over there. It’s the blood sinking in the earth gives
  5053	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnew life. Same idea those jews they said killed the christian boy. Every
  5054	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tman his price. Well preserved fat corpse, gentleman, epicure, invaluable
  5055	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor fruit garden. A bargain. By carcass of William Wilkinson, auditor
  5056	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand accountant, lately deceased, three pounds thirteen and six. With
  5057	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthanks.
  5058	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5059	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI daresay the soil would be quite fat with corpsemanure, bones, flesh,
  5060	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnails. Charnelhouses. Dreadful. Turning green and pink decomposing. Rot
  5061	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tquick in damp earth. The lean old ones tougher. Then a kind of a tallowy
  5062	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tkind of a cheesy. Then begin to get black, black treacle oozing out of
  5063	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem. Then dried up. Deathmoths. Of course the cells or whatever they

  5071	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCracking his jokes too: warms the cockles of his heart. The one about

  5073	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t(closing time). Not arrived yet. Peter. The dead themselves the men
  5074	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanyhow would like to hear an odd joke or the women to know what’s in
  5075	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfashion. A juicy pear or ladies’ punch, hot, strong and sweet. Keep

  5080	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsort of a joke. Read your own obituary notice they say you live longer.
  5081	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGives you second wind. New lease of life.
  5082	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5083	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—How many have you for tomorrow? the caretaker asked.
  5084	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5085	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Two, Corny Kelleher said. Half ten and eleven.
  5086	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5087	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe caretaker put the papers in his pocket. The barrow had ceased to
  5088	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttrundle. The mourners split and moved to each side of the hole, stepping
  5089	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith care round the graves. The gravediggers bore the coffin and set its
  5090	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnose on the brink, looping the bands round it.
  5091	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5092	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBurying him. We come to bury Cæsar. His ides of March or June. He
  5093	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdoesn’t know who is here nor care. Now who is that lankylooking galoot
  5094	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tover there in the macintosh? Now who is he I’d like to know? Now I’d
  5095	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgive a trifle to know who he is. Always someone turns up you never
  5096	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdreamt of. A fellow could live on his lonesome all his life. Yes, he
  5097	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcould. Still he’d have to get someone to sod him after he died though he
  5098	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcould dig his own grave. We all do. Only man buries. No, ants too. First
  5099	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthing strikes anybody. Bury the dead. Say Robinson Crusoe was true to
  5100	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlife. Well then Friday buried him. Every Friday buries a Thursday if you
  5101	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcome to look at it.
  5102	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5103	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     O, poor Robinson Crusoe!
  5104	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     How could you possibly do so?
  5105	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5106	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPoor Dignam! His last lie on the earth in his box. When you think of
  5107	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem all it does seem a waste of wood. All gnawed through. They could
  5108	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinvent a handsome bier with a kind of panel sliding, let it down that
  5109	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tway. Ay but they might object to be buried out of another fellow’s.
  5110	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey’re so particular. Lay me in my native earth. Bit of clay from
  5111	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe holy land. Only a mother and deadborn child ever buried in the one
  5112	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcoffin. I see what it means. I see. To protect him as long as possible
  5113	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\teven in the earth. The Irishman’s house is his coffin. Embalming in
  5114	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcatacombs, mummies the same idea.
  5115	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5116	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom stood far back, his hat in his hand, counting the bared heads.
  5117	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTwelve. I’m thirteen. No. The chap in the macintosh is thirteen. Death’s
  5118	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnumber. Where the deuce did he pop out of? He wasn’t in the chapel, that
  5119	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI’ll swear. Silly superstition that about thirteen.
  5120	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5121	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNice soft tweed Ned Lambert has in that suit. Tinge of purple. I had
  5122	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tone like that when we lived in Lombard street west. Dressy fellow he was
  5123	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tonce. Used to change three suits in the day. Must get that grey suit
  5124	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof mine turned by Mesias. Hello. It’s dyed. His wife I forgot he’s not
  5125	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmarried or his landlady ought to have picked out those threads for him.
  5126	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5127	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe coffin dived out of sight, eased down by the men straddled on the
  5128	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgravetrestles. They struggled up and out: and all uncovered. Twenty.
  5129	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5130	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPause.
  5131	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5132	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIf we were all suddenly somebody else.
  5133	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5134	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFar away a donkey brayed. Rain. No such ass. Never see a dead one, they
  5135	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsay. Shame of death. They hide. Also poor papa went away.
  5136	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5137	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGentle sweet air blew round the bared heads in a whisper. Whisper. The
  5138	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tboy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly in
  5139	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe black open space. Mr Bloom moved behind the portly kindly caretaker.
  5140	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWellcut frockcoat. Weighing them up perhaps to see which will go next.
  5141	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWell, it is a long rest. Feel no more. It’s the moment you feel. Must be
  5142	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdamned unpleasant. Can’t believe it at first. Mistake must be: someone
  5143	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\telse. Try the house opposite. Wait, I wanted to. I haven’t yet. Then
  5144	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdarkened deathchamber. Light they want. Whispering around you. Would you
  5145	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlike to see a priest? Then rambling and wandering. Delirium all you hid
  5146	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall your life. The death struggle. His sleep is not natural. Press his
  5147	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlower eyelid. Watching is his nose pointed is his jaw sinking are the
  5148	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsoles of his feet yellow. Pull the pillow away and finish it off on the
  5149	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfloor since he’s doomed. Devil in that picture of sinner’s death showing
  5150	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim a woman. Dying to embrace her in his shirt. Last act of Lucia. Shall
  5151	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI nevermore behold thee? Bam! He expires. Gone at last. People talk
  5152	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabout you a bit: forget you. Don’t forget to pray for him. Remember
  5153	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim in your prayers. Even Parnell. Ivy day dying out. Then they follow:
  5154	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdropping into a hole, one after the other.
  5155	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5156	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWe are praying now for the repose of his soul. Hoping you’re well and
  5157	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnot in hell. Nice change of air. Out of the fryingpan of life into the
  5158	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfire of purgatory.
  5159	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5160	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDoes he ever think of the hole waiting for himself? They say you do when
  5161	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou shiver in the sun. Someone walking over it. Callboy’s warning. Near
  5162	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou. Mine over there towards Finglas, the plot I bought. Mamma, poor
  5163	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmamma, and little Rudy.
  5164	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5165	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in
  5166	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton the coffin. Mr Bloom turned away his face. And if he was alive all
  5167	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe time? Whew! By jingo, that would be awful! No, no: he is dead, of
  5168	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcourse. Of course he is dead. Monday he died. They ought to have
  5169	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsome law to pierce the heart and make sure or an electric clock or
  5170	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta telephone in the coffin and some kind of a canvas airhole. Flag of
  5171	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdistress. Three days. Rather long to keep them in summer. Just as well
  5172	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto get shut of them as soon as you are sure there’s no.
  5173	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5174	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe clay fell softer. Begin to be forgotten. Out of sight, out of mind.
  5175	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5176	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat. Had enough of
  5177	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit. The mourners took heart of grace, one by one, covering themselves
  5178	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twithout show. Mr Bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make its
  5179	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tway deftly through the maze of graves. Quietly, sure of his ground, he
  5180	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttraversed the dismal fields.
  5181	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5182	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHynes jotting down something in his notebook. Ah, the names. But he
  5183	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknows them all. No: coming to me.
  5184	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5185	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I am just taking the names, Hynes said below his breath. What is your
  5186	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchristian name? I’m not sure.
  5187	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5188	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—L, Mr Bloom said. Leopold. And you might put down M’Coy’s name too. He
  5189	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tasked me to.
  5190	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5191	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Charley, Hynes said writing. I know. He was on the Freeman once.
  5192	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5193	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSo he was before he got the job in the morgue under Louis Byrne. Good
  5194	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tidea a postmortem for doctors. Find out what they imagine they know.
  5195	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe died of a Tuesday. Got the run. Levanted with the cash of a few ads.
  5196	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCharley, you’re my darling. That was why he asked me to. O well, does
  5197	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tno harm. I saw to that, M’Coy. Thanks, old chap: much obliged. Leave him
  5198	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunder an obligation: costs nothing.
  5199	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5200	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And tell us, Hynes said, do you know that fellow in the, fellow was
  5201	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tover there in the...
  5202	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5203	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe looked around.
  5204	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5205	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Macintosh. Yes, I saw him, Mr Bloom said. Where is he now?
  5206	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5207	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—M’Intosh, Hynes said scribbling. I don’t know who he is. Is that his
  5208	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tname?
  5209	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5210	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe moved away, looking about him.
  5211	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5212	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—No, Mr Bloom began, turning and stopping. I say, Hynes!
  5213	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5214	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDidn’t hear. What? Where has he disappeared to? Not a sign. Well of all
  5215	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe. Has anybody here seen? Kay ee double ell. Become invisible. Good
  5216	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLord, what became of him?
  5217	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5218	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade.
  5219	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5220	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O, excuse me!
  5221	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5222	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe stepped aside nimbly.
  5223	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5224	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tClay, brown, damp, began to be seen in the hole. It rose. Nearly over.
  5225	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA mound of damp clods rose more, rose, and the gravediggers rested their
  5226	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspades. All uncovered again for a few instants. The boy propped
  5227	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this wreath against a corner: the brother-in-law his on a lump. The
  5228	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards
  5229	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe barrow. Then knocked the blades lightly on the turf: clean. One bent
  5230	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass. One, leaving his mates,
  5231	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twalked slowly on with shouldered weapon, its blade blueglancing.
  5232	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSilently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband. His navelcord.
  5233	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe brother-in-law, turning away, placed something in his free hand.
  5234	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThanks in silence. Sorry, sir: trouble. Headshake. I know that. For
  5235	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyourselves just.
  5236	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5237	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe mourners moved away slowly without aim, by devious paths, staying at
  5238	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhiles to read a name on a tomb.
  5239	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5240	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Let us go round by the chief’s grave, Hynes said. We have time.
  5241	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5242	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Let us, Mr Power said.
  5243	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5244	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey turned to the right, following their slow thoughts. With awe Mr
  5245	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPower’s blank voice spoke:
  5246	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5247	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Some say he is not in that grave at all. That the coffin was filled
  5248	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith stones. That one day he will come again.
  5249	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5250	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHynes shook his head.
  5251	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5252	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Parnell will never come again, he said. He’s there, all that was mortal
  5253	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof him. Peace to his ashes.
  5254	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5255	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses,
  5256	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbroken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes,
  5257	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\told Ireland’s hearts and hands. More sensible to spend the money on some
  5258	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcharity for the living. Pray for the repose of the soul of. Does anybody
  5259	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\treally? Plant him and have done with him. Like down a coalshoot. Then
  5260	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlump them together to save time. All souls’ day. Twentyseventh I’ll be
  5261	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat his grave. Ten shillings for the gardener. He keeps it free of weeds.
  5262	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOld man himself. Bent down double with his shears clipping. Near death’s
  5263	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdoor. Who passed away. Who departed this life. As if they did it of
  5264	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir own accord. Got the shove, all of them. Who kicked the
  5265	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbucket. More interesting if they told you what they were. So and So,
  5266	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twheelwright. I travelled for cork lino. I paid five shillings in the
  5267	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpound. Or a woman’s with her saucepan. I cooked good Irish stew.
  5268	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEulogy in a country churchyard it ought to be that poem of whose is it
  5269	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWordsworth or Thomas Campbell. Entered into rest the protestants put it.
  5270	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOld Dr Murren’s. The great physician called him home. Well it’s God’s
  5271	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tacre for them. Nice country residence. Newly plastered and painted.
  5272	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIdeal spot to have a quiet smoke and read the Church Times. Marriage
  5273	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tads they never try to beautify. Rusty wreaths hung on knobs, garlands of
  5274	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbronzefoil. Better value that for the money. Still, the flowers are more
  5275	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpoetical. The other gets rather tiresome, never withering. Expresses
  5276	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnothing. Immortelles.

  5278	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA bird sat tamely perched on a poplar branch. Like stuffed. Like the
  5279	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twedding present alderman Hooper gave us. Hoo! Not a budge out of him.
  5280	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKnows there are no catapults to let fly at him. Dead animal even sadder.
  5281	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSilly-Milly burying the little dead bird in the kitchen matchbox, a

  5283	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5284	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe Sacred Heart that is: showing it. Heart on his sleeve. Ought to be
  5285	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsideways and red it should be painted like a real heart. Ireland was
  5286	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdedicated to it or whatever that. Seems anything but pleased. Why this
  5287	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinfliction? Would birds come then and peck like the boy with the basket
  5288	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof fruit but he said no because they ought to have been afraid of the

  5294	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBesides how could you remember everybody? Eyes, walk, voice. Well, the
  5295	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvoice, yes: gramophone. Have a gramophone in every grave or keep it in

  5308	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAn obese grey rat toddled along the side of the crypt, moving the

  5310	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\talive crushed itself in under the plinth, wriggled itself in under it.

  5353	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe Tantalus glasses. Heart of gold really. Yes, Menton. Got his rag out
  5354	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat evening on the bowlinggreen because I sailed inside him. Pure fluke
  5355	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof mine: the bias. Why he took such a rooted dislike to me. Hate

  5641	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe foreman handed back the galleypage suddenly, saying:

  5643	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Wait. Where’s the archbishop’s letter? It’s to be repeated in the
  5644	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTelegraph. Where’s what’s his name?
  5645	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t

  5650	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ay. Where’s Monks?
  5651	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5652	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Monks!
  5653	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t

  5667	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe walked on through the caseroom passing an old man, bowed, spectacled,
  5668	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\taproned. Old Monks, the dayfather. Queer lot of stuff he must have put
  5669	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthrough his hands in his time: obituary notices, pubs’ ads, speeches,
  5670	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdivorce suits, found drowned. Nearing the end of his tether now. Sober
  5671	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tserious man with a bit in the savingsbank I’d say. Wife a good cook and
  5672	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twasher. Daughter working the machine in the parlour. Plain Jane, no damn

  5674	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5675	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe stayed in his walk to watch a typesetter neatly distributing type.
  5676	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tReads it backwards first. Quickly he does it. Must require some practice

  5686	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThat’s what life is after all. How quickly he does that job. Practice

  5713	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5714	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The ghost walks, professor MacHugh murmured softly, biscuitfully to the
  5715	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdusty windowpane.
  5716	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5717	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Dedalus, staring from the empty fireplace at Ned Lambert’s quizzing
  5718	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tface, asked of it sourly:
  5719	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5720	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Agonising Christ, wouldn’t it give you a heartburn on your arse?
  5721	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5722	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNed Lambert, seated on the table, read on:
  5723	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5724	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Or again, note the meanderings of some purling rill as it babbles on
  5725	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tits way, tho’ quarrelling with the stony obstacles, to the tumbling
  5726	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twaters of Neptune’s blue domain, ‘mid mossy banks, fanned by gentlest

  5728	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\to’er its pensive bosom by the overarching leafage of the giants of
  5729	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe forest. What about that, Simon? he asked over the fringe of his
  5730	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnewspaper. How’s that for high?
  5731	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5732	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Changing his drink, Mr Dedalus said.
  5733	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5734	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNed Lambert, laughing, struck the newspaper on his knees, repeating:
  5735	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5736	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The pensive bosom and the overarsing leafage. O boys! O boys!
  5737	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5738	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And Xenophon looked upon Marathon, Mr Dedalus said, looking again on
  5739	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe fireplace and to the window, and Marathon looked on the sea.
  5740	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5741	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That will do, professor MacHugh cried from the window. I don’t want to
  5742	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thear any more of the stuff.
  5743	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5744	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe ate off the crescent of water biscuit he had been nibbling and,
  5745	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thungered, made ready to nibble the biscuit in his other hand.
  5746	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5747	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHigh falutin stuff. Bladderbags. Ned Lambert is taking a day off I see.
  5748	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRather upsets a man’s day, a funeral does. He has influence they

  5753	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEyre Chatterton. Daresay he writes him an odd shaky cheque or two on

  5755	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5756	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Just another spasm, Ned Lambert said.
  5757	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5758	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What is it? Mr Bloom asked.
  5759	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5760	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—A recently discovered fragment of Cicero, professor MacHugh answered
  5761	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith pomp of tone. Our lovely land. SHORT BUT TO THE POINT
  5762	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5763	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Whose land? Mr Bloom said simply.
  5764	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5765	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Most pertinent question, the professor said between his chews. With an
  5766	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\taccent on the whose.
  5767	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5768	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Dan Dawson’s land Mr Dedalus said.
  5769	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5770	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Is it his speech last night? Mr Bloom asked.
  5771	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5772	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNed Lambert nodded.
  5773	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5774	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—But listen to this, he said.
  5775	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5776	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe doorknob hit Mr Bloom in the small of the back as the door was
  5777	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpushed in.
  5778	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5779	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Excuse me, J. J. O’Molloy said, entering.
  5780	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5781	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom moved nimbly aside.
  5782	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5783	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I beg yours, he said.
  5784	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5785	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Good day, Jack.
  5786	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5787	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Come in. Come in.
  5788	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5789	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Good day.
  5790	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5791	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—How are you, Dedalus?
  5792	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5793	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Well. And yourself?
  5794	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5795	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJ. J. O’Molloy shook his head. SAD
  5796	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5797	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCleverest fellow at the junior bar he used to be. Decline, poor chap.
  5798	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThat hectic flush spells finis for a man. Touch and go with him. What’s
  5799	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the wind, I wonder. Money worry.
  5800	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5801	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Or again if we but climb the serried mountain peaks.
  5802	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5803	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You’re looking extra.
  5804	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5805	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Is the editor to be seen? J. J. O’Molloy asked, looking towards the
  5806	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinner door.
  5807	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5808	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Very much so, professor MacHugh said. To be seen and heard. He’s in his
  5809	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsanctum with Lenehan.
  5810	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5811	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJ. J. O’Molloy strolled to the sloping desk and began to turn back the
  5812	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpink pages of the file.
  5813	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5814	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPractice dwindling. A mighthavebeen. Losing heart. Gambling. Debts of
  5815	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thonour. Reaping the whirlwind. Used to get good retainers from D. and T.
  5816	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFitzgerald. Their wigs to show the grey matter. Brains on their sleeve
  5817	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlike the statue in Glasnevin. Believe he does some literary work for the
  5818	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tExpress with Gabriel Conroy. Wellread fellow. Myles Crawford began on
  5819	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe Independent. Funny the way those newspaper men veer about when
  5820	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey get wind of a new opening. Weathercocks. Hot and cold in the same
  5821	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbreath. Wouldn’t know which to believe. One story good till you hear
  5822	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe next. Go for one another baldheaded in the papers and then all blows

  5824	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5825	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ah, listen to this for God’ sake, Ned Lambert pleaded. Or again if we
  5826	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbut climb the serried mountain peaks...
  5827	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5828	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Bombast! the professor broke in testily. Enough of the inflated
  5829	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twindbag!
  5830	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5831	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Peaks, Ned Lambert went on, towering high on high, to bathe our souls,
  5832	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas it were...
  5833	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5834	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Bathe his lips, Mr Dedalus said. Blessed and eternal God! Yes? Is he
  5835	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttaking anything for it?
  5836	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5837	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—As ‘twere, in the peerless panorama of Ireland’s portfolio, unmatched,

  5839	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor very beauty, of bosky grove and undulating plain and luscious
  5840	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpastureland of vernal green, steeped in the transcendent translucent

  5842	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5843	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The moon, professor MacHugh said. He forgot Hamlet.

  5847	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5848	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O! Mr Dedalus cried, giving vent to a hopeless groan. Shite and onions!
  5849	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThat’ll do, Ned. Life is too short.
  5850	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5851	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe took off his silk hat and, blowing out impatiently his bushy
  5852	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmoustache, welshcombed his hair with raking fingers.
  5853	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5854	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNed Lambert tossed the newspaper aside, chuckling with delight. An
  5855	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinstant after a hoarse bark of laughter burst over professor MacHugh’s
  5856	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunshaven blackspectacled face.
  5857	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5858	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Doughy Daw! he cried. WHAT WETHERUP SAID
  5859	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5860	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAll very fine to jeer at it now in cold print but it goes down like hot
  5861	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcake that stuff. He was in the bakery line too, wasn’t he? Why they call
  5862	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim Doughy Daw. Feathered his nest well anyhow. Daughter engaged to that
  5863	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchap in the inland revenue office with the motor. Hooked that nicely.
  5864	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEntertainments. Open house. Big blowout. Wetherup always said that. Get

  5866	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5867	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe inner door was opened violently and a scarlet beaked face, crested
  5868	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby a comb of feathery hair, thrust itself in. The bold blue eyes stared
  5869	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabout them and the harsh voice asked:
  5870	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5871	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What is it?
  5872	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5873	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And here comes the sham squire himself! professor MacHugh said grandly.
  5874	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5875	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Getonouthat, you bloody old pedagogue! the editor said in recognition.
  5876	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5877	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Come, Ned, Mr Dedalus said, putting on his hat. I must get a drink
  5878	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tafter that.
  5879	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5880	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Drink! the editor cried. No drinks served before mass.
  5881	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5882	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Quite right too, Mr Dedalus said, going out. Come on, Ned.
  5883	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5884	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNed Lambert sidled down from the table. The editor’s blue eyes roved
  5885	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttowards Mr Bloom’s face, shadowed by a smile.
  5886	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5887	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Will you join us, Myles? Ned Lambert asked. MEMORABLE BATTLES RECALLED
  5888	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5889	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—North Cork militia! the editor cried, striding to the mantelpiece. We
  5890	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twon every time! North Cork and Spanish officers!
  5891	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5892	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Where was that, Myles? Ned Lambert asked with a reflective glance at
  5893	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this toecaps.
  5894	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5895	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—In Ohio! the editor shouted.
  5896	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5897	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—So it was, begad, Ned Lambert agreed.
  5898	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5899	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPassing out he whispered to J. J. O’Molloy:
  5900	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5901	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Incipient jigs. Sad case.
  5902	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5903	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ohio! the editor crowed in high treble from his uplifted scarlet face.
  5904	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMy Ohio!
  5905	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5906	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—A perfect cretic! the professor said. Long, short and long. O, HARP
  5907	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEOLIAN!
  5908	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5909	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe took a reel of dental floss from his waistcoat pocket and, breaking
  5910	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\toff a piece, twanged it smartly between two and two of his resonant

  5913	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Bingbang, bangbang.
  5914	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5915	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom, seeing the coast clear, made for the inner door.
  5916	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5917	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Just a moment, Mr Crawford, he said. I just want to phone about an ad.
  5918	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5919	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe went in.
  5920	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5921	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What about that leader this evening? professor MacHugh asked, coming to
  5922	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe editor and laying a firm hand on his shoulder.
  5923	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5924	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That’ll be all right, Myles Crawford said more calmly. Never you fret.
  5925	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHello, Jack. That’s all right.
  5926	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5927	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Good day, Myles, J. J. O’Molloy said, letting the pages he held slip
  5928	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlimply back on the file. Is that Canada swindle case on today?
  5929	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5930	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe telephone whirred inside.
  5931	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5932	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Twentyeight... No, twenty... Double four... Yes. SPOT THE WINNER
  5933	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5934	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLenehan came out of the inner office with Sport’s tissues.
  5935	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5936	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Who wants a dead cert for the Gold cup? he asked. Sceptre with O.
  5937	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMadden up.
  5938	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5939	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe tossed the tissues on to the table.
  5940	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5941	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tScreams of newsboys barefoot in the hall rushed near and the door was
  5942	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tflung open.
  5943	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5944	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Hush, Lenehan said. I hear feetstoops.
  5945	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5946	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tProfessor MacHugh strode across the room and seized the cringing urchin
  5947	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby the collar as the others scampered out of the hall and down the
  5948	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsteps. The tissues rustled up in the draught, floated softly in the air
  5949	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblue scrawls and under the table came to earth.
  5950	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5951	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—It wasn’t me, sir. It was the big fellow shoved me, sir.
  5952	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5953	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Throw him out and shut the door, the editor said. There’s a hurricane
  5954	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblowing.
  5955	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5956	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLenehan began to paw the tissues up from the floor, grunting as he
  5957	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstooped twice.
  5958	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5959	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Waiting for the racing special, sir, the newsboy said. It was Pat
  5960	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFarrell shoved me, sir.
  5961	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5962	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe pointed to two faces peering in round the doorframe.
  5963	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5964	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Him, sir.
  5965	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5966	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Out of this with you, professor MacHugh said gruffly.
  5967	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5968	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe hustled the boy out and banged the door to.
  5969	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5970	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJ. J. O’Molloy turned the files crackingly over, murmuring, seeking:
  5971	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5972	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Continued on page six, column four.
  5973	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5974	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, Evening Telegraph here, Mr Bloom phoned from the inner office. Is
  5975	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe boss...? Yes, Telegraph... To where? Aha! Which auction rooms?...
  5976	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAha! I see... Right. I’ll catch him. A COLLISION ENSUES
  5977	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5978	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe bell whirred again as he rang off. He came in quickly and bumped
  5979	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tagainst Lenehan who was struggling up with the second tissue.
  5980	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5981	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Pardon, monsieur, Lenehan said, clutching him for an instant and making
  5982	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta grimace.
  5983	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5984	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—My fault, Mr Bloom said, suffering his grip. Are you hurt? I’m in a
  5985	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thurry.
  5986	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5987	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Knee, Lenehan said.
  5988	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5989	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe made a comic face and whined, rubbing his knee:
  5990	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5991	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The accumulation of the anno Domini.
  5992	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5993	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Sorry, Mr Bloom said.
  5994	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5995	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe went to the door and, holding it ajar, paused. J. J. O’Molloy slapped
  5996	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe heavy pages over. The noise of two shrill voices, a mouthorgan,
  5997	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\techoed in the bare hallway from the newsboys squatted on the doorsteps:
  5998	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  5999	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     —We are the boys of Wexford
  6000	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     Who fought with heart and hand.
  6001	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6002	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEXIT BLOOM
  6003	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6004	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I’m just running round to Bachelor’s walk, Mr Bloom said, about this
  6005	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tad of Keyes’s. Want to fix it up. They tell me he’s round there in
  6006	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDillon’s.
  6007	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6008	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe looked indecisively for a moment at their faces. The editor who,
  6009	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tleaning against the mantelshelf, had propped his head on his hand,
  6010	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuddenly stretched forth an arm amply.
  6011	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6012	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Begone! he said. The world is before you.
  6013	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6014	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Back in no time, Mr Bloom said, hurrying out.
  6015	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6016	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJ. J. O’Molloy took the tissues from Lenehan’s hand and read them,
  6017	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblowing them apart gently, without comment.
  6018	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6019	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—He’ll get that advertisement, the professor said, staring through his
  6020	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind. Look at the young scamps
  6021	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tafter him.
  6022	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6023	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Show. Where? Lenehan cried, running to the window. A STREET CORTÈGE
  6024	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6025	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBoth smiled over the crossblind at the file of capering newsboys in Mr
  6026	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBloom’s wake, the last zigzagging white on the breeze a mocking kite, a
  6027	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttail of white bowknots.
  6028	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6029	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Look at the young guttersnipe behind him hue and cry, Lenehan said, and
  6030	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou’ll kick. O, my rib risible! Taking off his flat spaugs and the walk.
  6031	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSmall nines. Steal upon larks.
  6032	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6033	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe began to mazurka in swift caricature across the floor on sliding
  6034	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfeet past the fireplace to J. J. O’Molloy who placed the tissues in his
  6035	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\treceiving hands.
  6036	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6037	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What’s that? Myles Crawford said with a start. Where are the other two
  6038	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgone?
  6039	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6040	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Who? the professor said, turning. They’re gone round to the Oval for a
  6041	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdrink. Paddy Hooper is there with Jack Hall. Came over last night.
  6042	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6043	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Come on then, Myles Crawford said. Where’s my hat?
  6044	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6045	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe walked jerkily into the office behind, parting the vent of his
  6046	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjacket, jingling his keys in his back pocket. They jingled then in the
  6047	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tair and against the wood as he locked his desk drawer.
  6048	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6049	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—He’s pretty well on, professor MacHugh said in a low voice.
  6050	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6051	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Seems to be, J. J. O’Molloy said, taking out a cigarettecase in
  6052	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmurmuring meditation, but it is not always as it seems. Who has the most
  6053	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmatches? THE CALUMET OF PEACE
  6054	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6055	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe offered a cigarette to the professor and took one himself. Lenehan
  6056	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpromptly struck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn. J. J.
  6057	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tO’Molloy opened his case again and offered it.
  6058	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6059	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Thanky vous, Lenehan said, helping himself.
  6060	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6061	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe editor came from the inner office, a straw hat awry on his brow. He
  6062	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdeclaimed in song, pointing sternly at professor MacHugh:
  6063	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6064	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t      ‘Twas rank and fame that tempted thee,
  6065	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t      ‘Twas empire charmed thy heart.
  6066	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6067	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe professor grinned, locking his long lips.
  6068	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6069	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Eh? You bloody old Roman empire? Myles Crawford said.
  6070	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6071	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe took a cigarette from the open case. Lenehan, lighting it for him
  6072	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith quick grace, said:
  6073	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6074	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Silence for my brandnew riddle!
  6075	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6076	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Imperium romanum, J. J. O’Molloy said gently. It sounds nobler than
  6077	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBritish or Brixton. The word reminds one somehow of fat in the fire.
  6078	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6079	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMyles Crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling.
  6080	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6081	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That’s it, he said. We are the fat. You and I are the fat in the fire.
  6082	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWe haven’t got the chance of a snowball in hell. THE GRANDEUR THAT WAS
  6083	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tROME
  6084	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6085	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Wait a moment, professor MacHugh said, raising two quiet claws. We
  6086	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmustn’t be led away by words, by sounds of words. We think of Rome,
  6087	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\timperial, imperious, imperative.
  6088	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6089	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe extended elocutionary arms from frayed stained shirtcuffs, pausing:
  6090	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6091	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What was their civilisation? Vast, I allow: but vile. Cloacae: sewers.
  6092	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe Jews in the wilderness and on the mountaintop said: It is meet to be
  6093	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\there. Let us build an altar to Jehovah. The Roman, like the Englishman
  6094	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twho follows in his footsteps, brought to every new shore on which he set
  6095	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this foot (on our shore he never set it) only his cloacal obsession. He
  6096	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgazed about him in his toga and he said: It is meet to be here. Let us
  6097	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconstruct a watercloset.
  6098	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6099	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Which they accordingly did do, Lenehan said. Our old ancient ancestors,
  6100	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas we read in the first chapter of Guinness’s, were partial to the
  6101	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trunning stream.
  6102	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6103	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—They were nature’s gentlemen, J. J. O’Molloy murmured. But we have also
  6104	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRoman law.
  6105	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6106	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And Pontius Pilate is its prophet, professor MacHugh responded.
  6107	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6108	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Do you know that story about chief baron Palles? J. J. O’Molloy asked.
  6109	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIt was at the royal university dinner. Everything was going swimmingly
  6110	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t...
  6111	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6112	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—First my riddle, Lenehan said. Are you ready?
  6113	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6114	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr O’Madden Burke, tall in copious grey of Donegal tweed, came in from
  6115	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe hallway. Stephen Dedalus, behind him, uncovered as he entered.
  6116	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6117	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Entrez, mes enfants! Lenehan cried.
  6118	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6119	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I escort a suppliant, Mr O’Madden Burke said melodiously. Youth led by
  6120	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tExperience visits Notoriety.
  6121	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6122	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—How do you do? the editor said, holding out a hand. Come in. Your
  6123	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgovernor is just gone. ???
  6124	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6125	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLenehan said to all:
  6126	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6127	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Silence! What opera resembles a railwayline? Reflect, ponder,
  6128	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\texcogitate, reply.
  6129	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6130	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen handed over the typed sheets, pointing to the title and
  6131	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsignature.
  6132	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6133	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Who? the editor asked.
  6134	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6135	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBit torn off.
  6136	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6137	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Mr Garrett Deasy, Stephen said.
  6138	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6139	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That old pelters, the editor said. Who tore it? Was he short taken?
  6140	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6141	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     On swift sail flaming
  6142	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     From storm and south
  6143	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     He comes, pale vampire,
  6144	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     Mouth to my mouth.
  6145	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6146	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Good day, Stephen, the professor said, coming to peer over their
  6147	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshoulders. Foot and mouth? Are you turned...?
  6148	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6149	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBullockbefriending bard. SHINDY IN WELLKNOWN RESTAURANT
  6150	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6151	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Good day, sir, Stephen answered blushing. The letter is not mine. Mr
  6152	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGarrett Deasy asked me to...
  6153	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6154	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O, I know him, Myles Crawford said, and I knew his wife too. The
  6155	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbloodiest old tartar God ever made. By Jesus, she had the foot and mouth
  6156	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdisease and no mistake! The night she threw the soup in the waiter’s
  6157	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tface in the Star and Garter. Oho!
  6158	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6159	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA woman brought sin into the world. For Helen, the runaway wife of
  6160	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMenelaus, ten years the Greeks. O’Rourke, prince of Breffni.
  6161	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6162	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Is he a widower? Stephen asked.
  6163	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6164	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ay, a grass one, Myles Crawford said, his eye running down the
  6165	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttypescript. Emperor’s horses. Habsburg. An Irishman saved his life on
  6166	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe ramparts of Vienna. Don’t you forget! Maximilian Karl O’Donnell,
  6167	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgraf von Tirconnell in Ireland. Sent his heir over to make the king
  6168	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tan Austrian fieldmarshal now. Going to be trouble there one day. Wild
  6169	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgeese. O yes, every time. Don’t you forget that!
  6170	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6171	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The moot point is did he forget it, J. J. O’Molloy said quietly,
  6172	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tturning a horseshoe paperweight. Saving princes is a thank you job.
  6173	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6174	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tProfessor MacHugh turned on him.
  6175	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6176	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And if not? he said.
  6177	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6178	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I’ll tell you how it was, Myles Crawford began. A Hungarian it was one
  6179	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tday... LOST CAUSES NOBLE MARQUESS MENTIONED
  6180	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6181	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—We were always loyal to lost causes, the professor said. Success for
  6182	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tus is the death of the intellect and of the imagination. We were never
  6183	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tloyal to the successful. We serve them. I teach the blatant Latin
  6184	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlanguage. I speak the tongue of a race the acme of whose mentality is
  6185	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe maxim: time is money. Material domination. Dominus! Lord! Where is
  6186	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe spirituality? Lord Jesus? Lord Salisbury? A sofa in a westend club.
  6187	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut the Greek! KYRIE ELEISON!
  6188	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6189	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA smile of light brightened his darkrimmed eyes, lengthened his long
  6190	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlips.
  6191	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6192	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The Greek! he said again. Kyrios! Shining word! The vowels the Semite
  6193	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand the Saxon know not. Kyrie! The radiance of the intellect. I ought to
  6194	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprofess Greek, the language of the mind. Kyrie eleison! The closetmaker
  6195	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand the cloacamaker will never be lords of our spirit. We are liege
  6196	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsubjects of the catholic chivalry of Europe that foundered at Trafalgar
  6197	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand of the empire of the spirit, not an imperium, that went under with
  6198	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe Athenian fleets at Aegospotami. Yes, yes. They went under. Pyrrhus,
  6199	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmisled by an oracle, made a last attempt to retrieve the fortunes of
  6200	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGreece. Loyal to a lost cause.
  6201	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6202	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe strode away from them towards the window.
  6203	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6204	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—They went forth to battle, Mr O’Madden Burke said greyly, but they
  6205	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\talways fell.
  6206	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6207	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Boohoo! Lenehan wept with a little noise. Owing to a brick received in
  6208	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe latter half of the matinée. Poor, poor, poor Pyrrhus!
  6209	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6210	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe whispered then near Stephen’s ear: LENEHAN’S LIMERICK
  6211	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6212	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     There’s a ponderous pundit MacHugh
  6213	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     Who wears goggles of ebony hue.
  6214	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     As he mostly sees double
  6215	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     To wear them why trouble?
  6216	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     I can’t see the Joe Miller. Can you?
  6217	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6218	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIn mourning for Sallust, Mulligan says. Whose mother is beastly dead.
  6219	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6220	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMyles Crawford crammed the sheets into a sidepocket.
  6221	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6222	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That’ll be all right, he said. I’ll read the rest after. That’ll be all
  6223	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tright.
  6224	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6225	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLenehan extended his hands in protest.
  6226	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6227	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—But my riddle! he said. What opera is like a railwayline?
  6228	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6229	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Opera? Mr O’Madden Burke’s sphinx face reriddled.
  6230	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6231	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLenehan announced gladly:
  6232	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6233	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The Rose of Castile. See the wheeze? Rows of cast steel. Gee!
  6234	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6235	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe poked Mr O’Madden Burke mildly in the spleen. Mr O’Madden Burke fell
  6236	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tback with grace on his umbrella, feigning a gasp.
  6237	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6238	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Help! he sighed. I feel a strong weakness.
  6239	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6240	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLenehan, rising to tiptoe, fanned his face rapidly with the rustling
  6241	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttissues.
  6242	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6243	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe professor, returning by way of the files, swept his hand across
  6244	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen’s and Mr O’Madden Burke’s loose ties.
  6245	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6246	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Paris, past and present, he said. You look like communards.
  6247	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6248	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Like fellows who had blown up the Bastile, J. J. O’Molloy said in quiet
  6249	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmockery. Or was it you shot the lord lieutenant of Finland between you?
  6250	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tYou look as though you had done the deed. General Bobrikoff. OMNIUM
  6251	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGATHERUM
  6252	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6253	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—We were only thinking about it, Stephen said.
  6254	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6255	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—All the talents, Myles Crawford said. Law, the classics...
  6256	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6257	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The turf, Lenehan put in.
  6258	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6259	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Literature, the press.
  6260	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6261	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—If Bloom were here, the professor said. The gentle art of
  6262	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tadvertisement.
  6263	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6264	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And Madam Bloom, Mr O’Madden Burke added. The vocal muse. Dublin’s
  6265	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprime favourite.
  6266	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6267	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLenehan gave a loud cough.
  6268	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6269	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ahem! he said very softly. O, for a fresh of breath air! I caught a
  6270	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcold in the park. The gate was open. "YOU CAN DO IT!”
  6271	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6272	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe editor laid a nervous hand on Stephen’s shoulder.
  6273	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6274	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I want you to write something for me, he said. Something with a bite in
  6275	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit. You can do it. I see it in your face. In the lexicon of youth ...
  6276	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6277	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSee it in your face. See it in your eye. Lazy idle little schemer.
  6278	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6279	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Foot and mouth disease! the editor cried in scornful invective. Great
  6280	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnationalist meeting in Borris-in-Ossory. All balls! Bulldosing the
  6281	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpublic! Give them something with a bite in it. Put us all into it, damn
  6282	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tits soul. Father, Son and Holy Ghost and Jakes M’Carthy.
  6283	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6284	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—We can all supply mental pabulum, Mr O’Madden Burke said.
  6285	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6286	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen raised his eyes to the bold unheeding stare.
  6287	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6288	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—He wants you for the pressgang, J. J. O’Molloy said. THE GREAT GALLAHER
  6289	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6290	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You can do it, Myles Crawford repeated, clenching his hand in emphasis.
  6291	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWait a minute. We’ll paralyse Europe as Ignatius Gallaher used to say
  6292	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhen he was on the shaughraun, doing billiardmarking in the Clarence.
  6293	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGallaher, that was a pressman for you. That was a pen. You know how he
  6294	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmade his mark? I’ll tell you. That was the smartest piece of
  6295	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjournalism ever known. That was in eightyone, sixth of May, time of
  6296	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe invincibles, murder in the Phoenix park, before you were born, I
  6297	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuppose. I’ll show you.
  6298	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6299	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe pushed past them to the files.
  6300	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6301	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Look at here, he said turning. The New York World cabled for a special.
  6302	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRemember that time?
  6303	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6304	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tProfessor MacHugh nodded.
  6305	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6306	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—New York World, the editor said, excitedly pushing back his straw hat.
  6307	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhere it took place. Tim Kelly, or Kavanagh I mean. Joe Brady and the
  6308	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trest of them. Where Skin-the-Goat drove the car. Whole route, see?
  6309	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6310	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Skin-the-Goat, Mr O’Madden Burke said. Fitzharris. He has that cabman’s
  6311	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshelter, they say, down there at Butt bridge. Holohan told me. You know
  6312	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHolohan?
  6313	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6314	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Hop and carry one, is it? Myles Crawford said.
  6315	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6316	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And poor Gumley is down there too, so he told me, minding stones for
  6317	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe corporation. A night watchman.
  6318	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6319	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen turned in surprise.
  6320	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6321	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Gumley? he said. You don’t say so? A friend of my father’s, is it?
  6322	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6323	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Never mind Gumley, Myles Crawford cried angrily. Let Gumley mind
  6324	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe stones, see they don’t run away. Look at here. What did Ignatius
  6325	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGallaher do? I’ll tell you. Inspiration of genius. Cabled right away.
  6326	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHave you Weekly Freeman of 17 March? Right. Have you got that?
  6327	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6328	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe flung back pages of the files and stuck his finger on a point.
  6329	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6330	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Take page four, advertisement for Bransome’s coffee, let us say. Have
  6331	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou got that? Right.
  6332	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6333	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe telephone whirred. A DISTANT VOICE
  6334	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6335	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I’ll answer it, the professor said, going.
  6336	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6337	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—B is parkgate. Good.
  6338	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6339	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis finger leaped and struck point after point, vibrating.
  6340	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6341	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—T is viceregal lodge. C is where murder took place. K is Knockmaroon
  6342	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgate.
  6343	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6344	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe loose flesh of his neck shook like a cock’s wattles. An illstarched
  6345	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdicky jutted up and with a rude gesture he thrust it back into his
  6346	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twaistcoat.
  6347	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6348	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Hello? Evening Telegraph here... Hello?... Who’s there?... Yes...
  6349	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tYes... Yes.
  6350	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6351	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—F to P is the route Skin-the-Goat drove the car for an alibi,
  6352	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tInchicore, Roundtown, Windy Arbour, Palmerston Park, Ranelagh. F.A.B.P.
  6353	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGot that? X is Davy’s publichouse in upper Leeson street.
  6354	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6355	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe professor came to the inner door.
  6356	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6357	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Bloom is at the telephone, he said.
  6358	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6359	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Tell him go to hell, the editor said promptly. X is Davy’s publichouse,
  6360	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsee? CLEVER, VERY
  6361	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6362	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Clever, Lenehan said. Very.
  6363	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6364	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Gave it to them on a hot plate, Myles Crawford said, the whole bloody
  6365	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thistory.
  6366	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6367	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNightmare from which you will never awake.
  6368	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6369	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I saw it, the editor said proudly. I was present. Dick Adams, the
  6370	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbesthearted bloody Corkman the Lord ever put the breath of life in, and
  6371	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmyself.
  6372	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6373	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLenehan bowed to a shape of air, announcing:
  6374	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6375	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Madam, I’m Adam. And Able was I ere I saw Elba.
  6376	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6377	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—History! Myles Crawford cried. The Old Woman of Prince’s street was
  6378	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthere first. There was weeping and gnashing of teeth over that. Out of
  6379	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tan advertisement. Gregor Grey made the design for it. That gave him the
  6380	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tleg up. Then Paddy Hooper worked Tay Pay who took him on to the Star.
  6381	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNow he’s got in with Blumenfeld. That’s press. That’s talent. Pyatt! He
  6382	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas all their daddies!
  6383	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6384	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The father of scare journalism, Lenehan confirmed, and the
  6385	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrother-in-law of Chris Callinan.
  6386	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6387	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Hello?... Are you there?... Yes, he’s here still. Come across yourself.
  6388	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6389	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Where do you find a pressman like that now, eh? the editor cried.
  6390	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6391	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe flung the pages down.
  6392	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6393	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Clamn dever, Lenehan said to Mr O’Madden Burke.
  6394	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6395	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Very smart, Mr O’Madden Burke said.
  6396	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6397	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tProfessor MacHugh came from the inner office.
  6398	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6399	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Talking about the invincibles, he said, did you see that some hawkers
  6400	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere up before the recorder...
  6401	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6402	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O yes, J. J. O’Molloy said eagerly. Lady Dudley was walking home
  6403	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthrough the park to see all the trees that were blown down by that
  6404	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcyclone last year and thought she’d buy a view of Dublin. And it
  6405	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tturned out to be a commemoration postcard of Joe Brady or Number One or
  6406	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSkin-the-Goat. Right outside the viceregal lodge, imagine!
  6407	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6408	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—They’re only in the hook and eye department, Myles Crawford said.
  6409	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPsha! Press and the bar! Where have you a man now at the bar like those
  6410	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfellows, like Whiteside, like Isaac Butt, like silvertongued O’Hagan.
  6411	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEh? Ah, bloody nonsense. Psha! Only in the halfpenny place.
  6412	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6413	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis mouth continued to twitch unspeaking in nervous curls of disdain.
  6414	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6415	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWould anyone wish that mouth for her kiss? How do you know? Why did you
  6416	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twrite it then? RHYMES AND REASONS
  6417	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6418	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMouth, south. Is the mouth south someway? Or the south a mouth? Must be
  6419	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsome. South, pout, out, shout, drouth. Rhymes: two men dressed the same,
  6420	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlooking the same, two by two.

  6434	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6435	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJ. J. O’Molloy, smiling palely, took up the gage.
  6436	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6437	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—My dear Myles, he said, flinging his cigarette aside, you put a false
  6438	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconstruction on my words. I hold no brief, as at present advised, for
  6439	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe third profession qua profession but your Cork legs are running away
  6440	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith you. Why not bring in Henry Grattan and Flood and Demosthenes and
  6441	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEdmund Burke? Ignatius Gallaher we all know and his Chapelizod boss,
  6442	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHarmsworth of the farthing press, and his American cousin of the Bowery
  6443	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tguttersheet not to mention Paddy Kelly’s Budget, Pue’s Occurrences
  6444	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand our watchful friend The Skibbereen Eagle. Why bring in a master
  6445	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof forensic eloquence like Whiteside? Sufficient for the day is the
  6446	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnewspaper thereof. LINKS WITH BYGONE DAYS OF YORE
  6447	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6448	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Grattan and Flood wrote for this very paper, the editor cried in his
  6449	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tface. Irish volunteers. Where are you now? Established 1763. Dr Lucas.
  6450	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWho have you now like John Philpot Curran? Psha!
  6451	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6452	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Well, J. J. O’Molloy said, Bushe K.C., for example.
  6453	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6454	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Bushe? the editor said. Well, yes: Bushe, yes. He has a strain of it in
  6455	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this blood. Kendal Bushe or I mean Seymour Bushe.
  6456	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6457	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—He would have been on the bench long ago, the professor said, only for
  6458	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t... But no matter.
  6459	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6460	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJ. J. O’Molloy turned to Stephen and said quietly and slowly:
  6461	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6462	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—One of the most polished periods I think I ever listened to in my life
  6463	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfell from the lips of Seymour Bushe. It was in that case of fratricide,
  6464	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe Childs murder case. Bushe defended him.
  6465	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6466	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd in the porches of mine ear did pour.
  6467	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6468	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBy the way how did he find that out? He died in his sleep. Or the other
  6469	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstory, beast with two backs?
  6470	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6471	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What was that? the professor asked. ITALIA, MAGISTRA ARTIUM
  6472	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6473	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—He spoke on the law of evidence, J. J. O’Molloy said, of Roman justice
  6474	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas contrasted with the earlier Mosaic code, the lex talionis. And he
  6475	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcited the Moses of Michelangelo in the vatican.
  6476	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6477	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ha.
  6478	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6479	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—A few wellchosen words, Lenehan prefaced. Silence!
  6480	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6481	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPause. J. J. O’Molloy took out his cigarettecase.
  6482	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6483	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFalse lull. Something quite ordinary.
  6484	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6485	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMessenger took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar.
  6486	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6487	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that
  6488	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit was that small act, trivial in itself, that striking of that match,

  6493	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6494	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—He said of it: that stony effigy in frozen music, horned and terrible,
  6495	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the human form divine, that eternal symbol of wisdom and of prophecy
  6496	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhich, if aught that the imagination or the hand of sculptor has wrought

  6500	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall.
  6501	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6502	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Fine! Myles Crawford said at once.
  6503	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6504	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The divine afflatus, Mr O’Madden Burke said.
  6505	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6506	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You like it? J. J. O’Molloy asked Stephen.
  6507	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6508	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen, his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture, blushed. He
  6509	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttook a cigarette from the case. J. J. O’Molloy offered his case to Myles
  6510	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCrawford. Lenehan lit their cigarettes as before and took his trophy,
  6511	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaying:
  6512	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6513	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Muchibus thankibus. A MAN OF HIGH MORALE
  6514	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6515	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Professor Magennis was speaking to me about you, J. J. O’Molloy said to
  6516	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen. What do you think really of that hermetic crowd, the opal hush
  6517	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpoets: A. E. the mastermystic? That Blavatsky woman started it. She was
  6518	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta nice old bag of tricks. A. E. has been telling some yankee interviewer
  6519	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat you came to him in the small hours of the morning to ask him about
  6520	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplanes of consciousness. Magennis thinks you must have been pulling A.
  6521	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tE.‘s leg. He is a man of the very highest morale, Magennis.
  6522	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6523	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSpeaking about me. What did he say? What did he say? What did he say
  6524	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabout me? Don’t ask.
  6525	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6526	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—No, thanks, professor MacHugh said, waving the cigarettecase aside.
  6527	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWait a moment. Let me say one thing. The finest display of oratory I
  6528	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tever heard was a speech made by John F Taylor at the college historical
  6529	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsociety. Mr Justice Fitzgibbon, the present lord justice of appeal, had
  6530	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspoken and the paper under debate was an essay (new for those days),
  6531	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tadvocating the revival of the Irish tongue.
  6532	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6533	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe turned towards Myles Crawford and said:
  6534	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6535	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You know Gerald Fitzgibbon. Then you can imagine the style of his
  6536	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdiscourse.
  6537	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6538	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—He is sitting with Tim Healy, J. J. O’Molloy said, rumour has it, on
  6539	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe Trinity college estates commission.
  6540	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6541	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—He is sitting with a sweet thing, Myles Crawford said, in a child’s
  6542	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrock. Go on. Well?
  6543	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6544	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—It was the speech, mark you, the professor said, of a finished orator,
  6545	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfull of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction I will
  6546	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnot say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man’s contumely
  6547	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tupon the new movement. It was then a new movement. We were weak,
  6548	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttherefore worthless.
  6549	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6550	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe closed his long thin lips an instant but, eager to be on, raised
  6551	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tan outspanned hand to his spectacles and, with trembling thumb and
  6552	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tringfinger touching lightly the black rims, steadied them to a new
  6553	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfocus. IMPROMPTU
  6554	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6555	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIn ferial tone he addressed J. J. O’Molloy:
  6556	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6557	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Taylor had come there, you must know, from a sickbed. That he had
  6558	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprepared his speech I do not believe for there was not even one
  6559	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshorthandwriter in the hall. His dark lean face had a growth of shaggy
  6560	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeard round it. He wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he
  6561	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlooked (though he was not) a dying man.
  6562	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6563	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis gaze turned at once but slowly from J. J. O’Molloy’s towards
  6564	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen’s face and then bent at once to the ground, seeking. His
  6565	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head, soiled by his
  6566	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twithering hair. Still seeking, he said:
  6567	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6568	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—When Fitzgibbon’s speech had ended John F Taylor rose to reply.
  6569	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBriefly, as well as I can bring them to mind, his words were these.
  6570	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6571	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe raised his head firmly. His eyes bethought themselves once more.
  6572	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWitless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro, seeking outlet.
  6573	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6574	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe began:
  6575	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6576	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen: Great was my admiration in listening
  6577	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto the remarks addressed to the youth of Ireland a moment since by
  6578	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmy learned friend. It seemed to me that I had been transported into a
  6579	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcountry far away from this country, into an age remote from this age,
  6580	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat I stood in ancient Egypt and that I was listening to the speech of
  6581	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsome highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful Moses.
  6582	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6583	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear, their smokes
  6584	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech. And let our
  6585	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcrooked smokes. Noble words coming. Look out. Could you try your hand at
  6586	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit yourself?
  6587	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6588	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And it seemed to me that I heard the voice of that Egyptian highpriest
  6589	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\traised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride. I heard his words
  6590	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand their meaning was revealed to me. FROM THE FATHERS
  6591	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6592	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIt was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are corrupted
  6593	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhich neither if they were supremely good nor unless they were good
  6594	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcould be corrupted. Ah, curse you! That’s saint Augustine.
  6595	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6596	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Why will you jews not accept our culture, our religion and our
  6597	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlanguage? You are a tribe of nomad herdsmen: we are a mighty people. You
  6598	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thave no cities nor no wealth: our cities are hives of humanity and
  6599	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tour galleys, trireme and quadrireme, laden with all manner merchandise
  6600	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfurrow the waters of the known globe. You have but emerged from
  6601	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprimitive conditions: we have a literature, a priesthood, an agelong
  6602	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thistory and a polity.
  6603	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6604	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNile.
  6605	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6606	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tChild, man, effigy.
  6607	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6608	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBy the Nilebank the babemaries kneel, cradle of bulrushes: a man supple
  6609	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin combat: stonehorned, stonebearded, heart of stone.
  6610	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6611	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You pray to a local and obscure idol: our temples, majestic and
  6612	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmysterious, are the abodes of Isis and Osiris, of Horus and Ammon Ra.
  6613	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tYours serfdom, awe and humbleness: ours thunder and the seas. Israel
  6614	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tis weak and few are her children: Egypt is an host and terrible are her
  6615	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tarms. Vagrants and daylabourers are you called: the world trembles at
  6616	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tour name.
  6617	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6618	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech. He lifted his voice above it
  6619	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tboldly:
  6620	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6621	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—But, ladies and gentlemen, had the youthful Moses listened to and
  6622	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\taccepted that view of life, had he bowed his head and bowed his will
  6623	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never have
  6624	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrought the chosen people out of their house of bondage, nor followed
  6625	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe pillar of the cloud by day. He would never have spoken with the
  6626	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEternal amid lightnings on Sinai’s mountaintop nor ever have come down
  6627	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in
  6628	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this arms the tables of the law, graven in the language of the outlaw.
  6629	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6630	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe ceased and looked at them, enjoying a silence. OMINOUS—FOR HIM!
  6631	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6632	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJ. J. O’Molloy said not without regret:
  6633	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6634	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And yet he died without having entered the land of promise.
  6635	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6636	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—A sudden—at—the—moment—though—from—lingering—illness—often—
  6637	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpreviously—expectorated—demise, Lenehan added. And with a great future
  6638	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbehind him.
  6639	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6640	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe troop of bare feet was heard rushing along the hallway and pattering
  6641	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tup the staircase.
  6642	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6643	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That is oratory, the professor said uncontradicted.
  6644	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6645	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGone with the wind. Hosts at Mullaghmast and Tara of the kings. Miles of
  6646	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tears of porches. The tribune’s words, howled and scattered to the four
  6647	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twinds. A people sheltered within his voice. Dead noise. Akasic records
  6648	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof all that ever anywhere wherever was. Love and laud him: me no more.
  6649	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6650	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI have money.
  6651	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6652	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Gentlemen, Stephen said. As the next motion on the agenda paper may I
  6653	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuggest that the house do now adjourn?
  6654	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6655	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You take my breath away. It is not perchance a French compliment?
  6656	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr O’Madden Burke asked. ‘Tis the hour, methinks, when the winejug,
  6657	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmetaphorically speaking, is most grateful in Ye ancient hostelry.
  6658	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6659	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That it be and hereby is resolutely resolved. All that are in favour
  6660	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsay ay, Lenehan announced. The contrary no. I declare it carried. To
  6661	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhich particular boosing shed...? My casting vote is: Mooney’s!
  6662	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6663	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe led the way, admonishing:
  6664	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6665	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—We will sternly refuse to partake of strong waters, will we not? Yes,
  6666	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twe will not. By no manner of means.
  6667	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6668	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr O’Madden Burke, following close, said with an ally’s lunge of his
  6669	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tumbrella:
  6670	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6671	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Lay on, Macduff!
  6672	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6673	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Chip of the old block! the editor cried, clapping Stephen on the
  6674	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshoulder. Let us go. Where are those blasted keys?
  6675	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6676	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe fumbled in his pocket pulling out the crushed typesheets.
  6677	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6678	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Foot and mouth. I know. That’ll be all right. That’ll go in. Where are
  6679	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey? That’s all right.
  6680	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6681	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe thrust the sheets back and went into the inner office. LET US HOPE
  6682	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6683	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJ. J. O’Molloy, about to follow him in, said quietly to Stephen:
  6684	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6685	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I hope you will live to see it published. Myles, one moment.
  6686	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6687	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe went into the inner office, closing the door behind him.
  6688	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6689	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Come along, Stephen, the professor said. That is fine, isn’t it? It has
  6690	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe prophetic vision. Fuit Ilium! The sack of windy Troy. Kingdoms of
  6691	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthis world. The masters of the Mediterranean are fellaheen today.
  6692	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6693	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe first newsboy came pattering down the stairs at their heels and
  6694	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trushed out into the street, yelling:
  6695	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6696	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Racing special!
  6697	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6698	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDublin. I have much, much to learn.
  6699	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6700	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey turned to the left along Abbey street.
  6701	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6702	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I have a vision too, Stephen said.
  6703	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6704	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes? the professor said, skipping to get into step. Crawford will
  6705	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfollow.
  6706	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6707	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnother newsboy shot past them, yelling as he ran:
  6708	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6709	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Racing special! DEAR DIRTY DUBLIN
  6710	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6711	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDubliners.
  6712	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6713	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Two Dublin vestals, Stephen said, elderly and pious, have lived fifty
  6714	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand fiftythree years in Fumbally’s lane.
  6715	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6716	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Where is that? the professor asked.
  6717	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6718	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Off Blackpitts, Stephen said.
  6719	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6720	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDamp night reeking of hungry dough. Against the wall. Face glistering
  6721	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttallow under her fustian shawl. Frantic hearts. Akasic records. Quicker,
  6722	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdarlint!
  6723	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6724	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOn now. Dare it. Let there be life.
  6725	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6726	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—They want to see the views of Dublin from the top of Nelson’s pillar.
  6727	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey save up three and tenpence in a red tin letterbox moneybox. They
  6728	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshake out the threepenny bits and sixpences and coax out the pennies
  6729	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith the blade of a knife. Two and three in silver and one and seven
  6730	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin coppers. They put on their bonnets and best clothes and take their
  6731	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tumbrellas for fear it may come on to rain.
  6732	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6733	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Wise virgins, professor MacHugh said. LIFE ON THE RAW
  6734	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6735	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—They buy one and fourpenceworth of brawn and four slices of panloaf at
  6736	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe north city diningrooms in Marlborough street from Miss Kate Collins,
  6737	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tproprietress... They purchase four and twenty ripe plums from a girl at
  6738	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe foot of Nelson’s pillar to take off the thirst of the brawn. They
  6739	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgive two threepenny bits to the gentleman at the turnstile and begin
  6740	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto waddle slowly up the winding staircase, grunting, encouraging each
  6741	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tother, afraid of the dark, panting, one asking the other have you the
  6742	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrawn, praising God and the Blessed Virgin, threatening to come down,
  6743	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpeeping at the airslits. Glory be to God. They had no idea it was that
  6744	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thigh.
  6745	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6746	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTheir names are Anne Kearns and Florence MacCabe. Anne Kearns has the
  6747	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlumbago for which she rubs on Lourdes water, given her by a lady who got
  6748	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta bottleful from a passionist father. Florence MacCabe takes a crubeen
  6749	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand a bottle of double X for supper every Saturday.
  6750	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6751	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Antithesis, the professor said nodding twice. Vestal virgins. I can see
  6752	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem. What’s keeping our friend?
  6753	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6754	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe turned.
  6755	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6756	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA bevy of scampering newsboys rushed down the steps, scattering in all
  6757	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdirections, yelling, their white papers fluttering. Hard after them
  6758	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMyles Crawford appeared on the steps, his hat aureoling his scarlet
  6759	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tface, talking with J. J. O’Molloy.
  6760	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6761	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Come along, the professor cried, waving his arm.
  6762	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6763	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe set off again to walk by Stephen’s side. RETURN OF BLOOM
  6764	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6765	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, he said. I see them.
  6766	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6767	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom, breathless, caught in a whirl of wild newsboys near the
  6768	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\toffices of the Irish Catholic and Dublin Penny Journal, called:
  6769	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6770	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Mr Crawford! A moment!
  6771	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6772	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Telegraph! Racing special!
  6773	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6774	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What is it? Myles Crawford said, falling back a pace.
  6775	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6776	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA newsboy cried in Mr Bloom’s face:
  6777	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6778	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Terrible tragedy in Rathmines! A child bit by a bellows! INTERVIEW WITH
  6779	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTHE EDITOR
  6780	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  6781	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Just this ad, Mr Bloom said, pushing through towards the steps,
  6782	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpuffing, and taking the cutting from his pocket. I spoke with Mr Keyes
  6783	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjust now. He’ll give a renewal for two months, he says. After he’ll see.
  6784	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut he wants a par to call attention in the Telegraph too, the Saturday
  6785	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpink. And he wants it copied if it’s not too late I told councillor
  6786	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNannetti from the Kilkenny People. I can have access to it in the

  7068	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom smiled O rocks at two windows of the ballastoffice. She’s right
  7069	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tafter all. Only big words for ordinary things on account of the sound.
  7070	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe’s not exactly witty. Can be rude too. Blurt out what I was thinking.
  7071	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStill, I don’t know. She used to say Ben Dollard had a base barreltone
  7072	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvoice. He has legs like barrels and you’d think he was singing into a
  7073	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbarrel. Now, isn’t that wit. They used to call him big Ben. Not half as
  7074	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twitty as calling him base barreltone. Appetite like an albatross. Get
  7075	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\toutside of a baron of beef. Powerful man he was at stowing away number
  7076	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tone Bass. Barrel of Bass. See? It all works out.

  7078	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA procession of whitesmocked sandwichmen marched slowly towards him

  7080	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat priest they are this morning: we have sinned: we have suffered. He
  7081	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tread the scarlet letters on their five tall white hats: H. E. L. Y. S.
  7082	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWisdom Hely’s. Y lagging behind drew a chunk of bread from under his
  7083	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tforeboard, crammed it into his mouth and munched as he walked. Our
  7084	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstaple food. Three bob a day, walking along the gutters, street after
  7085	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstreet. Just keep skin and bone together, bread and skilly. They are
  7086	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnot Boyl: no, M’Glade’s men. Doesn’t bring in any business either.
  7087	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI suggested to him about a transparent showcart with two smart girls
  7088	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsitting inside writing letters, copybooks, envelopes, blottingpaper. I
  7089	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbet that would have caught on. Smart girls writing something catch the
  7090	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\teye at once. Everyone dying to know what she’s writing. Get twenty of
  7091	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem round you if you stare at nothing. Have a finger in the pie. Women
  7092	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttoo. Curiosity. Pillar of salt. Wouldn’t have it of course because he
  7093	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdidn’t think of it himself first. Or the inkbottle I suggested with a
  7094	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfalse stain of black celluloid. His ideas for ads like Plumtree’s potted

  7096	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOur envelopes. Hello, Jones, where are you going? Can’t stop, Robinson,
  7097	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI am hastening to purchase the only reliable inkeraser Kansell, sold by

  7102	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto bargain with that sort of a woman. I disturbed her at her devotions
  7103	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat morning. But glad to communicate with the outside world. Our
  7104	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgreat day, she said. Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. Sweet name too:
  7105	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcaramel. She knew I, I think she knew by the way she. If she had married
  7106	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe would have changed. I suppose they really were short of money. Fried
  7107	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\teverything in the best butter all the same. No lard for them. My heart’s

  7118	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe port into his soup before the flag fell. Bobbob lapping it for the
  7119	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinner alderman. Couldn’t hear what the band played. For what we have
  7120	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\talready received may the Lord make us. Milly was a kiddy then. Molly

  7124	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGoodwin’s tall hat done up with some sticky stuff. Flies’ picnic
  7125	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttoo. Never put a dress on her back like it. Fitted her like a glove,
  7126	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshoulders and hips. Just beginning to plump it out well. Rabbitpie we
  7127	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad that day. People looking after her.
  7128	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7129	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHappy. Happier then. Snug little room that was with the red wallpaper.

  7132	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlooked soaped all over. Shapely too. Now photography. Poor papa’s

  7135	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe walked along the curbstone.

  7137	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStream of life. What was the name of that priestylooking chap was always
  7138	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsquinting in when he passed? Weak eyes, woman. Stopped in Citron’s saint
  7139	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKevin’s parade. Pen something. Pendennis? My memory is getting. Pen
  7140	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t...? Of course it’s years ago. Noise of the trams probably. Well, if he

  7143	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBartell d’Arcy was the tenor, just coming out then. Seeing her home
  7144	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tafter practice. Conceited fellow with his waxedup moustache. Gave her

  7146	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7147	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWindy night that was I went to fetch her there was that lodge meeting on
  7148	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabout those lottery tickets after Goodwin’s concert in the supperroom or
  7149	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\toakroom of the Mansion house. He and I behind. Sheet of her music blew
  7150	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout of my hand against the High school railings. Lucky it didn’t.
  7151	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThing like that spoils the effect of a night for her. Professor Goodwin
  7152	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlinking her in front. Shaky on his pins, poor old sot. His farewell
  7153	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconcerts. Positively last appearance on any stage. May be for months and
  7154	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmay be for never. Remember her laughing at the wind, her blizzard collar
  7155	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tup. Corner of Harcourt road remember that gust. Brrfoo! Blew up all her
  7156	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tskirts and her boa nearly smothered old Goodwin. She did get flushed
  7157	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the wind. Remember when we got home raking up the fire and frying up
  7158	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthose pieces of lap of mutton for her supper with the Chutney sauce she
  7159	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tliked. And the mulled rum. Could see her in the bedroom from the hearth
  7160	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunclamping the busk of her stays: white.
  7161	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7162	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSwish and soft flop her stays made on the bed. Always warm from her.
  7163	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAlways liked to let her self out. Sitting there after till near two
  7164	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttaking out her hairpins. Milly tucked up in beddyhouse. Happy. Happy.
  7165	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThat was the night...
  7166	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7167	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O, Mr Bloom, how do you do?
  7168	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7169	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O, how do you do, Mrs Breen?
  7170	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7171	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—No use complaining. How is Molly those times? Haven’t seen her for
  7172	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tages.
  7173	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7174	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—In the pink, Mr Bloom said gaily. Milly has a position down in
  7175	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMullingar, you know.
  7176	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7177	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Go away! Isn’t that grand for her?
  7178	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7179	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes. In a photographer’s there. Getting on like a house on fire. How
  7180	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tare all your charges?
  7181	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7182	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—All on the baker’s list, Mrs Breen said.
  7183	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7184	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHow many has she? No other in sight.
  7185	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7186	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You’re in black, I see. You have no...
  7187	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7188	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—No, Mr Bloom said. I have just come from a funeral.
  7189	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7190	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGoing to crop up all day, I foresee. Who’s dead, when and what did he
  7191	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdie of? Turn up like a bad penny.
  7192	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7193	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O, dear me, Mrs Breen said. I hope it wasn’t any near relation.
  7194	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7195	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMay as well get her sympathy.
  7196	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7197	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Dignam, Mr Bloom said. An old friend of mine. He died quite suddenly,
  7198	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpoor fellow. Heart trouble, I believe. Funeral was this morning.
  7199	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7200	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t      Your funeral’s tomorrow
  7201	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t      While you’re coming through the rye.

  7203	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t      Diddlediddle...
  7204	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7205	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Sad to lose the old friends, Mrs Breen’s womaneyes said melancholily.
  7206	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7207	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNow that’s quite enough about that. Just: quietly: husband.
  7208	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7209	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And your lord and master?
  7210	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7211	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMrs Breen turned up her two large eyes. Hasn’t lost them anyhow.
  7212	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7213	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O, don’t be talking! she said. He’s a caution to rattlesnakes. He’s
  7214	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin there now with his lawbooks finding out the law of libel. He has me
  7215	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\theartscalded. Wait till I show you.
  7216	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7217	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHot mockturtle vapour and steam of newbaked jampuffs rolypoly poured
  7218	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout from Harrison’s. The heavy noonreek tickled the top of Mr Bloom’s
  7219	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgullet. Want to make good pastry, butter, best flour, Demerara sugar,
  7220	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tor they’d taste it with the hot tea. Or is it from her? A barefoot
  7221	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tarab stood over the grating, breathing in the fumes. Deaden the gnaw of
  7222	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thunger that way. Pleasure or pain is it? Penny dinner. Knife and fork
  7223	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchained to the table.
  7224	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7225	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOpening her handbag, chipped leather. Hatpin: ought to have a guard on
  7226	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthose things. Stick it in a chap’s eye in the tram. Rummaging. Open.
  7227	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMoney. Please take one. Devils if they lose sixpence. Raise Cain.
  7228	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHusband barging. Where’s the ten shillings I gave you on Monday? Are
  7229	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou feeding your little brother’s family? Soiled handkerchief:
  7230	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmedicinebottle. Pastille that was fell. What is she?...
  7231	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7232	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—There must be a new moon out, she said. He’s always bad then. Do you
  7233	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknow what he did last night?
  7234	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7235	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHer hand ceased to rummage. Her eyes fixed themselves on him, wide in
  7236	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\talarm, yet smiling.
  7237	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7238	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What? Mr Bloom asked.
  7239	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7240	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLet her speak. Look straight in her eyes. I believe you. Trust me.
  7241	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7242	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Woke me up in the night, she said. Dream he had, a nightmare.
  7243	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7244	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIndiges.
  7245	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7246	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Said the ace of spades was walking up the stairs.
  7247	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7248	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The ace of spades! Mr Bloom said.
  7249	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7250	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe took a folded postcard from her handbag.
  7251	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7252	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Read that, she said. He got it this morning.
  7253	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7254	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What is it? Mr Bloom asked, taking the card. U.P.?
  7255	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7256	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—U.P.: up, she said. Someone taking a rise out of him. It’s a great
  7257	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshame for them whoever he is.
  7258	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7259	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Indeed it is, Mr Bloom said.
  7260	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7261	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe took back the card, sighing.
  7262	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7263	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And now he’s going round to Mr Menton’s office. He’s going to take an
  7264	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\taction for ten thousand pounds, he says.
  7265	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7266	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe folded the card into her untidy bag and snapped the catch.
  7267	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7268	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSame blue serge dress she had two years ago, the nap bleaching. Seen its
  7269	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbest days. Wispish hair over her ears. And that dowdy toque: three old
  7270	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgrapes to take the harm out of it. Shabby genteel. She used to be a
  7271	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttasty dresser. Lines round her mouth. Only a year or so older than
  7272	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMolly.
  7273	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7274	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSee the eye that woman gave her, passing. Cruel. The unfair sex.
  7275	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7276	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe looked still at her, holding back behind his look his discontent.
  7277	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPungent mockturtle oxtail mulligatawny. I’m hungry too. Flakes of pastry
  7278	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton the gusset of her dress: daub of sugary flour stuck to her cheek.
  7279	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRhubarb tart with liberal fillings, rich fruit interior. Josie Powell
  7280	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat was. In Luke Doyle’s long ago. Dolphin’s Barn, the charades. U.P.:
  7281	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tup.
  7282	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7283	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tChange the subject.
  7284	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7285	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Do you ever see anything of Mrs Beaufoy? Mr Bloom asked.
  7286	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7287	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Mina Purefoy? she said.
  7288	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7289	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPhilip Beaufoy I was thinking. Playgoers’ Club. Matcham often thinks of
  7290	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe masterstroke. Did I pull the chain? Yes. The last act.
  7291	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7292	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes.
  7293	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7294	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I just called to ask on the way in is she over it. She’s in the
  7295	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlying-in hospital in Holles street. Dr Horne got her in. She’s three
  7296	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdays bad now.
  7297	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7298	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O, Mr Bloom said. I’m sorry to hear that.
  7299	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7300	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, Mrs Breen said. And a houseful of kids at home. It’s a very stiff
  7301	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbirth, the nurse told me.
  7302	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7303	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O, Mr Bloom said.
  7304	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7305	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis heavy pitying gaze absorbed her news. His tongue clacked in
  7306	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcompassion. Dth! Dth!
  7307	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7308	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I’m sorry to hear that, he said. Poor thing! Three days! That’s
  7309	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tterrible for her.
  7310	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7311	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMrs Breen nodded.
  7312	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7313	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—She was taken bad on the Tuesday...
  7314	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7315	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom touched her funnybone gently, warning her:
  7316	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7317	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Mind! Let this man pass.
  7318	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7319	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA bony form strode along the curbstone from the river staring with a
  7320	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trapt gaze into the sunlight through a heavystringed glass. Tight as a
  7321	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tskullpiece a tiny hat gripped his head. From his arm a folded dustcoat,
  7322	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta stick and an umbrella dangled to his stride.
  7323	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7324	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Watch him, Mr Bloom said. He always walks outside the lampposts. Watch!
  7325	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7326	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Who is he if it’s a fair question? Mrs Breen asked. Is he dotty?
  7327	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7328	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—His name is Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, Mr Bloom
  7329	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaid smiling. Watch!
  7330	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7331	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—He has enough of them, she said. Denis will be like that one of these
  7332	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdays.
  7333	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7334	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe broke off suddenly.
  7335	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7336	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—There he is, she said. I must go after him. Goodbye. Remember me to
  7337	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMolly, won’t you?
  7338	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7339	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I will, Mr Bloom said.
  7340	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7341	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe watched her dodge through passers towards the shopfronts. Denis Breen
  7342	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin skimpy frockcoat and blue canvas shoes shuffled out of Harrison’s

  7874	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7875	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Hello, Flynn.
  7876	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7877	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—How’s things?
  7878	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7879	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Tiptop... Let me see. I’ll take a glass of burgundy and... let me see.
  7880	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7881	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSardines on the shelves. Almost taste them by looking. Sandwich? Ham
  7882	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand his descendants musterred and bred there. Potted meats. What is home
  7883	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twithout Plumtree’s potted meat? Incomplete. What a stupid ad! Under the
  7884	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tobituary notices they stuck it. All up a plumtree. Dignam’s potted meat.
  7885	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCannibals would with lemon and rice. White missionary too salty. Like
  7886	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpickled pork. Expect the chief consumes the parts of honour. Ought to be
  7887	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttough from exercise. His wives in a row to watch the effect. There was
  7888	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta right royal old nigger. Who ate or something the somethings of the
  7889	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\treverend Mr MacTrigger. With it an abode of bliss. Lord knows what
  7890	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconcoction. Cauls mouldy tripes windpipes faked and minced up. Puzzle
  7891	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfind the meat. Kosher. No meat and milk together. Hygiene that was what
  7892	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey call now. Yom Kippur fast spring cleaning of inside. Peace and
  7893	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twar depend on some fellow’s digestion. Religions. Christmas turkeys and
  7894	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgeese. Slaughter of innocents. Eat drink and be merry. Then casual wards
  7895	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfull after. Heads bandaged. Cheese digests all but itself. Mity cheese.
  7896	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7897	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Have you a cheese sandwich?
  7898	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7899	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, sir.
  7900	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7901	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLike a few olives too if they had them. Italian I prefer. Good glass of
  7902	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tburgundy take away that. Lubricate. A nice salad, cool as a cucumber,
  7903	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTom Kernan can dress. Puts gusto into it. Pure olive oil. Milly served
  7904	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tme that cutlet with a sprig of parsley. Take one Spanish onion. God made
  7905	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfood, the devil the cooks. Devilled crab.
  7906	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7907	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Wife well?
  7908	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7909	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Quite well, thanks... A cheese sandwich, then. Gorgonzola, have you?
  7910	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7911	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, sir.
  7912	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7913	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNosey Flynn sipped his grog.
  7914	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7915	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Doing any singing those times?
  7916	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7917	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLook at his mouth. Could whistle in his own ear. Flap ears to match.
  7918	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMusic. Knows as much about it as my coachman. Still better tell him.
  7919	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDoes no harm. Free ad.
  7920	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7921	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—She’s engaged for a big tour end of this month. You may have heard
  7922	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tperhaps.
  7923	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7924	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—No. O, that’s the style. Who’s getting it up?
  7925	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7926	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe curate served.
  7927	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7928	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—How much is that?
  7929	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7930	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Seven d., sir... Thank you, sir.
  7931	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7932	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom cut his sandwich into slender strips. Mr MacTrigger. Easier
  7933	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthan the dreamy creamy stuff. His five hundred wives. Had the time of
  7934	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir lives.
  7935	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7936	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Mustard, sir?
  7937	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7938	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Thank you.
  7939	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7940	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe studded under each lifted strip yellow blobs. Their lives. I have it.
  7941	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIt grew bigger and bigger and bigger.
  7942	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7943	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Getting it up? he said. Well, it’s like a company idea, you see. Part
  7944	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshares and part profits.
  7945	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7946	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ay, now I remember, Nosey Flynn said, putting his hand in his pocket to
  7947	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tscratch his groin. Who is this was telling me? Isn’t Blazes Boylan mixed
  7948	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tup in it?
  7949	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7950	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA warm shock of air heat of mustard hanched on Mr Bloom’s heart. He
  7951	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\traised his eyes and met the stare of a bilious clock. Two. Pub clock
  7952	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfive minutes fast. Time going on. Hands moving. Two. Not yet.
  7953	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7954	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis midriff yearned then upward, sank within him, yearned more longly,
  7955	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlongingly.
  7956	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7957	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWine.
  7958	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7959	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe smellsipped the cordial juice and, bidding his throat strongly to
  7960	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspeed it, set his wineglass delicately down.
  7961	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7962	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, he said. He’s the organiser in point of fact.
  7963	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7964	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNo fear: no brains.
  7965	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7966	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNosey Flynn snuffled and scratched. Flea having a good square meal.
  7967	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7968	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—He had a good slice of luck, Jack Mooney was telling me, over that
  7969	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tboxingmatch Myler Keogh won again that soldier in the Portobello
  7970	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbarracks. By God, he had the little kipper down in the county Carlow he
  7971	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas telling me...
  7972	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7973	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHope that dewdrop doesn’t come down into his glass. No, snuffled it up.
  7974	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7975	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—For near a month, man, before it came off. Sucking duck eggs by God
  7976	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttill further orders. Keep him off the boose, see? O, by God, Blazes is a
  7977	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thairy chap.
  7978	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7979	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDavy Byrne came forward from the hindbar in tuckstitched shirtsleeves,
  7980	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcleaning his lips with two wipes of his napkin. Herring’s blush. Whose
  7981	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsmile upon each feature plays with such and such replete. Too much fat
  7982	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton the parsnips.
  7983	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7984	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And here’s himself and pepper on him, Nosey Flynn said. Can you give us
  7985	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta good one for the Gold cup?
  7986	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7987	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I’m off that, Mr Flynn, Davy Byrne answered. I never put anything on a
  7988	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thorse.
  7989	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7990	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You’re right there, Nosey Flynn said.
  7991	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7992	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom ate his strips of sandwich, fresh clean bread, with relish of
  7993	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdisgust pungent mustard, the feety savour of green cheese. Sips of his
  7994	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twine soothed his palate. Not logwood that. Tastes fuller this weather
  7995	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith the chill off.
  7996	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  7997	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNice quiet bar. Nice piece of wood in that counter. Nicely planed. Like
  7998	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe way it curves there.
  7999	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8000	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I wouldn’t do anything at all in that line, Davy Byrne said. It ruined
  8001	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmany a man, the same horses.
  8002	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8003	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tVintners’ sweepstake. Licensed for the sale of beer, wine and spirits
  8004	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor consumption on the premises. Heads I win tails you lose.
  8005	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8006	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—True for you, Nosey Flynn said. Unless you’re in the know. There’s
  8007	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tno straight sport going now. Lenehan gets some good ones. He’s giving
  8008	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSceptre today. Zinfandel’s the favourite, lord Howard de Walden’s, won
  8009	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat Epsom. Morny Cannon is riding him. I could have got seven to one
  8010	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tagainst Saint Amant a fortnight before.
  8011	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8012	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That so? Davy Byrne said...
  8013	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8014	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe went towards the window and, taking up the pettycash book, scanned
  8015	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tits pages.
  8016	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8017	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I could, faith, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling. That was a rare bit of
  8018	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thorseflesh. Saint Frusquin was her sire. She won in a thunderstorm,
  8019	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRothschild’s filly, with wadding in her ears. Blue jacket and yellow
  8020	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcap. Bad luck to big Ben Dollard and his John O’Gaunt. He put me off it.
  8021	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAy.
  8022	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8023	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe drank resignedly from his tumbler, running his fingers down the
  8024	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tflutes.
  8025	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8026	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ay, he said, sighing.
  8027	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8028	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom, champing, standing, looked upon his sigh. Nosey numbskull.
  8029	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWill I tell him that horse Lenehan? He knows already. Better let him
  8030	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tforget. Go and lose more. Fool and his money. Dewdrop coming down again.
  8031	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCold nose he’d have kissing a woman. Still they might like. Prickly
  8032	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeards they like. Dogs’ cold noses. Old Mrs Riordan with the rumbling
  8033	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstomach’s Skye terrier in the City Arms hotel. Molly fondling him in her
  8034	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlap. O, the big doggybowwowsywowsy!

  8036	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWine soaked and softened rolled pith of bread mustard a moment mawkish

  8039	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSix. Six. Time will be gone then. She...
  8040	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8041	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMild fire of wine kindled his veins. I wanted that badly. Felt so

  8043	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlobsters’ claws. All the odd things people pick up for food. Out of
  8044	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshells, periwinkles with a pin, off trees, snails out of the ground the
  8045	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFrench eat, out of the sea with bait on a hook. Silly fish learn nothing
  8046	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin a thousand years. If you didn’t know risky putting anything into your
  8047	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmouth. Poisonous berries. Johnny Magories. Roundness you think good.
  8048	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGaudy colour warns you off. One fellow told another and so on. Try it
  8049	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton the dog first. Led on by the smell or the look. Tempting fruit.
  8050	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIce cones. Cream. Instinct. Orangegroves for instance. Need artificial
  8051	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tirrigation. Bleibtreustrasse. Yes but what about oysters. Unsightly like
  8052	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta clot of phlegm. Filthy shells. Devil to open them too. Who found them
  8053	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout? Garbage, sewage they feed on. Fizz and Red bank oysters. Effect

  8057	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJugged hare. First catch your hare. Chinese eating eggs fifty years old,
  8058	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblue and green again. Dinner of thirty courses. Each dish harmless might

  8061	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tscruff off his own head? Cheapest lunch in town. Of course aristocrats,
  8062	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthen the others copy to be in the fashion. Milly too rock oil and flour.
  8063	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRaw pastry I like myself. Half the catch of oysters they throw back in
  8064	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe sea to keep up the price. Cheap no-one would buy. Caviare. Do the
  8065	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgrand. Hock in green glasses. Swell blowout. Lady this. Powdered bosom

  8146	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Was he? Nosey Flynn said. So he was, faith. I asked him how was all at
  8147	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thome. You’re right, by God. So he was.
  8148	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8149	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I never broach the subject, Davy Byrne said humanely, if I see a
  8150	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgentleman is in trouble that way. It only brings it up fresh in their
  8151	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tminds.
  8152	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8153	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—It’s not the wife anyhow, Nosey Flynn said. I met him the day before
  8154	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyesterday and he coming out of that Irish farm dairy John Wyse Nolan’s
  8155	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twife has in Henry street with a jar of cream in his hand taking it home
  8156	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto his better half. She’s well nourished, I tell you. Plovers on toast.
  8157	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8158	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And is he doing for the Freeman? Davy Byrne said.
  8159	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8160	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNosey Flynn pursed his lips.
  8161	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8162	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—He doesn’t buy cream on the ads he picks up. You can make bacon of
  8163	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat.
  8164	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8165	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—How so? Davy Byrne asked, coming from his book.
  8166	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8167	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNosey Flynn made swift passes in the air with juggling fingers. He
  8168	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twinked.
  8169	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8170	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—He’s in the craft, he said.
  8171	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8172	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Do you tell me so? Davy Byrne said.
  8173	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8174	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Very much so, Nosey Flynn said. Ancient free and accepted order. He’s
  8175	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tan excellent brother. Light, life and love, by God. They give him a leg
  8176	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tup. I was told that by a—well, I won’t say who.
  8177	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8178	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Is that a fact?
  8179	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8180	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O, it’s a fine order, Nosey Flynn said. They stick to you when you’re
  8181	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdown. I know a fellow was trying to get into it. But they’re as close as
  8182	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdamn it. By God they did right to keep the women out of it.
  8183	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8184	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDavy Byrne smiledyawnednodded all in one:
  8185	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8186	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Iiiiiichaaaaaaach!
  8187	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8188	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—There was one woman, Nosey Flynn said, hid herself in a clock to find
  8189	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout what they do be doing. But be damned but they smelt her out and
  8190	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tswore her in on the spot a master mason. That was one of the saint
  8191	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLegers of Doneraile.
  8192	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8193	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDavy Byrne, sated after his yawn, said with tearwashed eyes:
  8194	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8195	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And is that a fact? Decent quiet man he is. I often saw him in here and
  8196	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI never once saw him—you know, over the line.
  8197	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8198	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—God Almighty couldn’t make him drunk, Nosey Flynn said firmly. Slips
  8199	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\toff when the fun gets too hot. Didn’t you see him look at his watch? Ah,
  8200	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou weren’t there. If you ask him to have a drink first thing he does
  8201	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the outs with the watch to see what he ought to imbibe. Declare to God he
  8202	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdoes.
  8203	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8204	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—There are some like that, Davy Byrne said. He’s a safe man, I’d say.
  8205	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8206	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—He’s not too bad, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling it up. He’s been known to
  8207	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tput his hand down too to help a fellow. Give the devil his due. O, Bloom
  8208	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thas his good points. But there’s one thing he’ll never do.
  8209	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8210	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis hand scrawled a dry pen signature beside his grog.
  8211	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8212	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I know, Davy Byrne said.
  8213	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8214	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Nothing in black and white, Nosey Flynn said.
  8215	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8216	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPaddy Leonard and Bantam Lyons came in. Tom Rochford followed frowning,
  8217	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta plaining hand on his claret waistcoat.
  8218	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8219	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Day, Mr Byrne.
  8220	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8221	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Day, gentlemen.
  8222	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8223	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey paused at the counter.
  8224	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8225	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Who’s standing? Paddy Leonard asked.
  8226	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8227	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I’m sitting anyhow, Nosey Flynn answered.
  8228	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8229	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Well, what’ll it be? Paddy Leonard asked.
  8230	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8231	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I’ll take a stone ginger, Bantam Lyons said.
  8232	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8233	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—How much? Paddy Leonard cried. Since when, for God’ sake? What’s yours,
  8234	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTom?
  8235	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8236	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—How is the main drainage? Nosey Flynn asked, sipping.
  8237	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8238	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFor answer Tom Rochford pressed his hand to his breastbone and
  8239	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thiccupped.
  8240	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8241	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Would I trouble you for a glass of fresh water, Mr Byrne? he said.
  8242	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8243	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Certainly, sir.
  8244	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8245	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPaddy Leonard eyed his alemates.
  8246	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8247	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Lord love a duck, he said. Look at what I’m standing drinks to! Cold
  8248	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twater and gingerpop! Two fellows that would suck whisky off a sore leg.
  8249	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe has some bloody horse up his sleeve for the Gold cup. A dead snip.
  8250	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8251	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Zinfandel is it? Nosey Flynn asked.
  8252	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8253	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTom Rochford spilt powder from a twisted paper into the water set before
  8254	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim.
  8255	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8256	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That cursed dyspepsia, he said before drinking.
  8257	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8258	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Breadsoda is very good, Davy Byrne said.
  8259	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8260	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTom Rochford nodded and drank.
  8261	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8262	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Is it Zinfandel?
  8263	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8264	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Say nothing! Bantam Lyons winked. I’m going to plunge five bob on my
  8265	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\town.
  8266	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8267	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Tell us if you’re worth your salt and be damned to you, Paddy Leonard
  8268	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaid. Who gave it to you?
  8269	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8270	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom on his way out raised three fingers in greeting.
  8271	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8272	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—So long! Nosey Flynn said.
  8273	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8274	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe others turned.
  8275	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8276	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That’s the man now that gave it to me, Bantam Lyons whispered.
  8277	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8278	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Prrwht! Paddy Leonard said with scorn. Mr Byrne, sir, we’ll take two of
  8279	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyour small Jamesons after that and a...
  8280	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8281	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Stone ginger, Davy Byrne added civilly.
  8282	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8283	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ay, Paddy Leonard said. A suckingbottle for the baby.
  8284	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8285	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom walked towards Dawson street, his tongue brushing his teeth
  8286	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsmooth. Something green it would have to be: spinach, say. Then with
  8287	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthose Röntgen rays searchlight you could.
  8288	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8289	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAt Duke lane a ravenous terrier choked up a sick knuckly cud on the
  8290	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcobblestones and lapped it with new zest. Surfeit. Returned with thanks
  8291	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thaving fully digested the contents. First sweet then savoury. Mr Bloom
  8292	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcoasted warily. Ruminants. His second course. Their upper jaw they move.
  8293	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWonder if Tom Rochford will do anything with that invention of his?
  8294	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWasting time explaining it to Flynn’s mouth. Lean people long mouths.
  8295	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOught to be a hall or a place where inventors could go in and invent
  8296	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfree. Course then you’d have all the cranks pestering.
  8297	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8298	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe hummed, prolonging in solemn echo the closes of the bars:
  8299	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8300	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t      Don Giovanni, a cenar teco
  8301	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t      M’invitasti.
  8302	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8303	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFeel better. Burgundy. Good pick me up. Who distilled first? Some
  8304	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchap in the blues. Dutch courage. That Kilkenny People in the national
  8305	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlibrary now I must.
  8306	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8307	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBare clean closestools waiting in the window of William Miller, plumber,
  8308	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tturned back his thoughts. They could: and watch it all the way down,
  8309	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tswallow a pin sometimes come out of the ribs years after, tour round the
  8310	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbody changing biliary duct spleen squirting liver gastric juice coils of
  8311	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tintestines like pipes. But the poor buffer would have to stand all the
  8312	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttime with his insides entrails on show. Science.
  8313	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8314	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—A cenar teco.
  8315	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8316	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhat does that teco mean? Tonight perhaps.
  8317	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8318	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     Don Giovanni, thou hast me invited
  8319	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     To come to supper tonight,
  8320	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     The rum the rumdum.
  8321	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8322	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDoesn’t go properly.
  8323	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8324	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKeyes: two months if I get Nannetti to. That’ll be two pounds ten about
  8325	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttwo pounds eight. Three Hynes owes me. Two eleven. Prescott’s dyeworks
  8326	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvan over there. If I get Billy Prescott’s ad: two fifteen. Five guineas
  8327	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabout. On the pig’s back.
  8328	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8329	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCould buy one of those silk petticoats for Molly, colour of her new
  8330	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgarters.
  8331	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8332	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tToday. Today. Not think.
  8333	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8334	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTour the south then. What about English wateringplaces? Brighton,
  8335	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMargate. Piers by moonlight. Her voice floating out. Those lovely
  8336	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseaside girls. Against John Long’s a drowsing loafer lounged in heavy
  8337	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthought, gnawing a crusted knuckle. Handy man wants job. Small wages.
  8338	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWill eat anything.
  8339	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8340	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom turned at Gray’s confectioner’s window of unbought tarts and
  8341	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpassed the reverend Thomas Connellan’s bookstore. Why I left the church
  8342	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof Rome? Birds’ Nest. Women run him. They say they used to give pauper
  8343	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchildren soup to change to protestants in the time of the potato blight.
  8344	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSociety over the way papa went to for the conversion of poor jews. Same
  8345	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbait. Why we left the church of Rome.
  8346	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8347	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA blind stripling stood tapping the curbstone with his slender cane. No
  8348	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttram in sight. Wants to cross.
  8349	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8350	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Do you want to cross? Mr Bloom asked.
  8351	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8352	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe blind stripling did not answer. His wallface frowned weakly. He
  8353	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmoved his head uncertainly.
  8354	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8355	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You’re in Dawson street, Mr Bloom said. Molesworth street is opposite.
  8356	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDo you want to cross? There’s nothing in the way.
  8357	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8358	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe cane moved out trembling to the left. Mr Bloom’s eye followed its
  8359	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tline and saw again the dyeworks’ van drawn up before Drago’s. Where I
  8360	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaw his brillantined hair just when I was. Horse drooping. Driver in
  8361	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJohn Long’s. Slaking his drouth.
  8362	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8363	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—There’s a van there, Mr Bloom said, but it’s not moving. I’ll see you
  8364	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tacross. Do you want to go to Molesworth street?
  8365	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8366	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, the stripling answered. South Frederick street.
  8367	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8368	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Come, Mr Bloom said.
  8369	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8370	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe touched the thin elbow gently: then took the limp seeing hand to
  8371	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tguide it forward.
  8372	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8373	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSay something to him. Better not do the condescending. They mistrust
  8374	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhat you tell them. Pass a common remark.
  8375	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8376	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The rain kept off.
  8377	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8378	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNo answer.
  8379	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8380	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStains on his coat. Slobbers his food, I suppose. Tastes all different
  8381	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor him. Have to be spoonfed first. Like a child’s hand, his hand. Like
  8382	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMilly’s was. Sensitive. Sizing me up I daresay from my hand. Wonder
  8383	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tif he has a name. Van. Keep his cane clear of the horse’s legs: tired
  8384	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdrudge get his doze. That’s right. Clear. Behind a bull: in front of a
  8385	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thorse.
  8386	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8387	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Thanks, sir.
  8388	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8389	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKnows I’m a man. Voice.
  8390	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8391	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Right now? First turn to the left.
  8392	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8393	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way, drawing
  8394	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this cane back, feeling again.
  8395	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8396	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom walked behind the eyeless feet, a flatcut suit of herringbone
  8397	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttweed. Poor young fellow! How on earth did he know that van was there?
  8398	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMust have felt it. See things in their forehead perhaps: kind of sense
  8399	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof volume. Weight or size of it, something blacker than the dark. Wonder
  8400	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould he feel it if something was removed. Feel a gap. Queer idea of
  8401	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDublin he must have, tapping his way round by the stones. Could he walk
  8402	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin a beeline if he hadn’t that cane? Bloodless pious face like a fellow
  8403	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgoing in to be a priest.
  8404	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8405	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPenrose! That was that chap’s name.
  8406	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8407	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLook at all the things they can learn to do. Read with their fingers.
  8408	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTune pianos. Or we are surprised they have any brains. Why we think a
  8409	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdeformed person or a hunchback clever if he says something we might say.
  8410	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOf course the other senses are more. Embroider. Plait baskets. People
  8411	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tought to help. Workbasket I could buy for Molly’s birthday. Hates
  8412	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsewing. Might take an objection. Dark men they call them.
  8413	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8414	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSense of smell must be stronger too. Smells on all sides, bunched
  8415	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttogether. Each street different smell. Each person too. Then the spring,
  8416	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe summer: smells. Tastes? They say you can’t taste wines with your
  8417	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\teyes shut or a cold in the head. Also smoke in the dark they say get no
  8418	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpleasure.
  8419	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8420	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd with a woman, for instance. More shameless not seeing. That girl
  8421	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpassing the Stewart institution, head in the air. Look at me. I have
  8422	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem all on. Must be strange not to see her. Kind of a form in his
  8423	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmind’s eye. The voice, temperatures: when he touches her with his
  8424	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfingers must almost see the lines, the curves. His hands on her hair,
  8425	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor instance. Say it was black, for instance. Good. We call it black.
  8426	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThen passing over her white skin. Different feel perhaps. Feeling of
  8427	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhite.
  8428	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8429	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPostoffice. Must answer. Fag today. Send her a postal order two
  8430	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshillings, half a crown. Accept my little present. Stationer’s just here
  8431	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttoo. Wait. Think over it.
  8432	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8433	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWith a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back above
  8434	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this ears. Again. Fibres of fine fine straw. Then gently his finger felt
  8435	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe skin of his right cheek. Downy hair there too. Not smooth enough.
  8436	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe belly is the smoothest. No-one about. There he goes into Frederick
  8437	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstreet. Perhaps to Levenston’s dancing academy piano. Might be settling

  8631	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That model schoolboy, Stephen said, would find Hamlet’s musings about
  8632	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe afterlife of his princely soul, the improbable, insignificant and
  8633	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tundramatic monologue, as shallow as Plato’s.
  8634	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8635	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJohn Eglinton, frowning, said, waxing wroth:
  8636	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t

  8655	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Is he?
  8656	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8657	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I was showing him Jubainville’s book. He’s quite enthusiastic, don’t

  8671	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—People do not know how dangerous lovesongs can be, the auric egg of
  8672	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRussell warned occultly. The movements which work revolutions in the
  8673	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tworld are born out of the dreams and visions in a peasant’s heart on the
  8674	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thillside. For them the earth is not an exploitable ground but the
  8675	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tliving mother. The rarefied air of the academy and the arena produce the
  8676	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsixshilling novel, the musichall song. France produces the finest flower
  8677	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof corruption in Mallarmé but the desirable life is revealed only to the

  8679	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8680	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFrom these words Mr Best turned an unoffending face to Stephen.
  8681	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8682	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Mallarmé, don’t you know, he said, has written those wonderful prose
  8683	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpoems Stephen MacKenna used to read to me in Paris. The one about
  8684	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHamlet. He says: il se promène, lisant au livre de lui-même, don’t you
  8685	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknow, reading the book of himself. He describes Hamlet given in a French
  8686	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttown, don’t you know, a provincial town. They advertised it.
  8687	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8688	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis free hand graciously wrote tiny signs in air.

  8701	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8702	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJohn Eglinton laughed.
  8703	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8704	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, I suppose it would be, he said. Excellent people, no doubt, but
  8705	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdistressingly shortsighted in some matters.
  8706	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8707	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSumptuous and stagnant exaggeration of murder.
  8708	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t

  8710	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor nothing was he a butcher’s son, wielding the sledded poleaxe and
  8711	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspitting in his palms. Nine lives are taken off for his father’s one.

  8732	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8733	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What is a ghost? Stephen said with tingling energy. One who has faded
  8734	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinto impalpability through death, through absence, through change of
  8735	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmanners. Elizabethan London lay as far from Stratford as corrupt Paris
  8736	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlies from virgin Dublin. Who is the ghost from limbo patrum, returning
  8737	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto the world that has forgotten him? Who is King Hamlet?
  8738	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8739	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJohn Eglinton shifted his spare body, leaning back to judge.
  8740	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8741	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLifted.
  8742	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8743	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—It is this hour of a day in mid June, Stephen said, begging with a
  8744	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tswift glance their hearing. The flag is up on the playhouse by the
  8745	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbankside. The bear Sackerson growls in the pit near it, Paris garden.
  8746	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCanvasclimbers who sailed with Drake chew their sausages among the
  8747	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgroundlings.

  8750	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8751	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Shakespeare has left the huguenot’s house in Silver street and walks by
  8752	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe swanmews along the riverbank. But he does not stay to feed the pen
  8753	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchivying her game of cygnets towards the rushes. The swan of Avon has
  8754	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tother thoughts.
  8755	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8756	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tComposition of place. Ignatius Loyola, make haste to help me!
  8757	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8758	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The play begins. A player comes on under the shadow, made up in the
  8759	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcastoff mail of a court buck, a wellset man with a bass voice. It is the
  8760	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tghost, the king, a king and no king, and the player is Shakespeare who
  8761	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thas studied Hamlet all the years of his life which were not vanity in
  8762	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\torder to play the part of the spectre. He speaks the words to Burbage,
  8763	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe young player who stands before him beyond the rack of cerecloth,
  8764	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcalling him by a name:
  8765	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8766	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHamlet, I am thy father’s spirit,
  8767	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8768	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbidding him list. To a son he speaks, the son of his soul, the prince,
  8769	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyoung Hamlet and to the son of his body, Hamnet Shakespeare, who has
  8770	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdied in Stratford that his namesake may live for ever.
  8771	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8772	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIs it possible that that player Shakespeare, a ghost by absence, and in
  8773	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe vesture of buried Denmark, a ghost by death, speaking his own words
  8774	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto his own son’s name (had Hamnet Shakespeare lived he would have been
  8775	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprince Hamlet’s twin), is it possible, I want to know, or probable that
  8776	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises: you
  8777	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tare the dispossessed son: I am the murdered father: your mother is the
  8778	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tguilty queen, Ann Shakespeare, born Hathaway?
  8779	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8780	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—But this prying into the family life of a great man, Russell began
  8781	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\timpatiently.
  8782	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8783	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tArt thou there, truepenny?
  8784	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8785	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Interesting only to the parish clerk. I mean, we have the plays. I
  8786	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmean when we read the poetry of King Lear what is it to us how the poet
  8787	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlived? As for living our servants can do that for us, Villiers de l’Isle
  8788	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thas said. Peeping and prying into greenroom gossip of the day, the
  8789	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpoet’s drinking, the poet’s debts. We have King Lear: and it is
  8790	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\timmortal.
  8791	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8792	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Best’s face, appealed to, agreed.

  8805	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8806	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDo you intend to pay it back?
  8807	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8808	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tO, yes.
  8809	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8810	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen? Now?
  8811	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8812	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWell... No.
  8813	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8814	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen, then?
  8815	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8816	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI paid my way. I paid my way.

  8837	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Do you mean to fly in the face of the tradition of three centuries?
  8838	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJohn Eglinton’s carping voice asked. Her ghost at least has been laid
  8839	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor ever. She died, for literature at least, before she was born.
  8840	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8841	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—She died, Stephen retorted, sixtyseven years after she was born. She
  8842	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaw him into and out of the world. She took his first embraces. She bore
  8843	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this children and she laid pennies on his eyes to keep his eyelids closed
  8844	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhen he lay on his deathbed.
  8845	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8846	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMother’s deathbed. Candle. The sheeted mirror. Who brought me into
  8847	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthis world lies there, bronzelidded, under few cheap flowers. Liliata

  8849	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8850	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI wept alone.
  8851	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8852	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJohn Eglinton looked in the tangled glowworm of his lamp.
  8853	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8854	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The world believes that Shakespeare made a mistake, he said, and got
  8855	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout of it as quickly and as best he could.
  8856	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8857	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Bosh! Stephen said rudely. A man of genius makes no mistakes. His
  8858	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\terrors are volitional and are the portals of discovery.
  8859	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8860	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPortals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian,
  8861	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsoftcreakfooted, bald, eared and assiduous.
  8862	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8863	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—A shrew, John Eglinton said shrewdly, is not a useful portal of
  8864	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdiscovery, one should imagine. What useful discovery did Socrates learn
  8865	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom Xanthippe?
  8866	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8867	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Dialectic, Stephen answered: and from his mother how to bring thoughts
  8868	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinto the world. What he learnt from his other wife Myrto (absit nomen!),
  8869	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSocratididion’s Epipsychidion, no man, not a woman, will ever know. But
  8870	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tneither the midwife’s lore nor the caudlelectures saved him from the
  8871	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tarchons of Sinn Fein and their naggin of hemlock.
  8872	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8873	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—But Ann Hathaway? Mr Best’s quiet voice said forgetfully. Yes, we seem
  8874	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto be forgetting her as Shakespeare himself forgot her.
  8875	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8876	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis look went from brooder’s beard to carper’s skull, to remind, to
  8877	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchide them not unkindly, then to the baldpink lollard costard, guiltless
  8878	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthough maligned.
  8879	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8880	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—He had a good groatsworth of wit, Stephen said, and no truant memory.
  8881	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to Romeville whistling
  8882	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe girl I left behind me. If the earthquake did not time it we should
  8883	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknow where to place poor Wat, sitting in his form, the cry of hounds,
  8884	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe studded bridle and her blue windows. That memory, Venus and Adonis,
  8885	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlay in the bedchamber of every light-of-love in London. Is Katharine the
  8886	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshrew illfavoured? Hortensio calls her young and beautiful. Do you think
  8887	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe writer of Antony and Cleopatra, a passionate pilgrim, had his
  8888	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\teyes in the back of his head that he chose the ugliest doxy in all
  8889	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWarwickshire to lie withal? Good: he left her and gained the world
  8890	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof men. But his boywomen are the women of a boy. Their life, thought,
  8891	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspeech are lent them by males. He chose badly? He was chosen, it seems
  8892	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto me. If others have their will Ann hath a way. By cock, she was to
  8893	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblame. She put the comether on him, sweet and twentysix. The greyeyed
  8894	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgoddess who bends over the boy Adonis, stooping to conquer, as prologue
  8895	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto the swelling act, is a boldfaced Stratford wench who tumbles in a
  8896	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcornfield a lover younger than herself.
  8897	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8898	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd my turn? When?
  8899	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8900	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCome!
  8901	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8902	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ryefield, Mr Best said brightly, gladly, raising his new book, gladly,
  8903	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrightly.
  8904	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8905	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe murmured then with blond delight for all:
  8906	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8907	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t      Between the acres of the rye
  8908	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t      These pretty countryfolk would lie.

  8912	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA tall figure in bearded homespun rose from shadow and unveiled its
  8913	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcooperative watch.
  8914	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8915	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I am afraid I am due at the Homestead.
  8916	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8917	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhither away? Exploitable ground.
  8918	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8919	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Are you going? John Eglinton’s active eyebrows asked. Shall we see you
  8920	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat Moore’s tonight? Piper is coming.
  8921	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8922	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Piper! Mr Best piped. Is Piper back?
  8923	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8924	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPeter Piper pecked a peck of pick of peck of pickled pepper.
  8925	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8926	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I don’t know if I can. Thursday. We have our meeting. If I can get away
  8927	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin time.
  8928	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8929	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tYogibogeybox in Dawson chambers. Isis Unveiled. Their Pali book we tried

  8940	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8941	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—They say we are to have a literary surprise, the quaker librarian said,
  8942	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfriendly and earnest. Mr Russell, rumour has it, is gathering together
  8943	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta sheaf of our younger poets’ verses. We are all looking forward
  8944	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanxiously.
  8945	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8946	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnxiously he glanced in the cone of lamplight where three faces,
  8947	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlighted, shone.
  8948	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8949	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSee this. Remember.
  8950	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8951	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen looked down on a wide headless caubeen, hung on his
  8952	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tashplanthandle over his knee. My casque and sword. Touch lightly with
  8953	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttwo index fingers. Aristotle’s experiment. One or two? Necessity is that
  8954	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin virtue of which it is impossible that one can be otherwise. Argal,
  8955	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tone hat is one hat.
  8956	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8957	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tListen.
  8958	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8959	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tYoung Colum and Starkey. George Roberts is doing the commercial part.
  8960	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLongworth will give it a good puff in the Express. O, will he? I liked
  8961	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tColum’s Drover. Yes, I think he has that queer thing genius. Do you
  8962	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthink he has genius really? Yeats admired his line: As in wild earth
  8963	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta Grecian vase. Did he? I hope you’ll be able to come tonight. Malachi
  8964	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMulligan is coming too. Moore asked him to bring Haines. Did you hear
  8965	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMiss Mitchell’s joke about Moore and Martyn? That Moore is Martyn’s
  8966	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twild oats? Awfully clever, isn’t it? They remind one of Don Quixote and
  8967	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSancho Panza. Our national epic has yet to be written, Dr Sigerson says.
  8968	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMoore is the man for it. A knight of the rueful countenance here in
  8969	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDublin. With a saffron kilt? O’Neill Russell? O, yes, he must speak the
  8970	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgrand old tongue. And his Dulcinea? James Stephens is doing some clever
  8971	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsketches. We are becoming important, it seems.
  8972	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8973	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCordelia. Cordoglio. Lir’s loneliest daughter.

  8976	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8977	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Thank you very much, Mr Russell, Stephen said, rising. If you will be
  8978	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tso kind as to give the letter to Mr Norman...
  8979	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8980	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O, yes. If he considers it important it will go in. We have so much
  8981	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcorrespondence.
  8982	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8983	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I understand, Stephen said. Thanks.

  8986	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8987	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSynge has promised me an article for Dana too. Are we going to be read?
  8988	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI feel we are. The Gaelic league wants something in Irish. I hope you
  8989	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twill come round tonight. Bring Starkey.
  8990	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8991	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen sat down.
  8992	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8993	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe quaker librarian came from the leavetakers. Blushing, his mask said:
  8994	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8995	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Mr Dedalus, your views are most illuminating.
  8996	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  8997	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe creaked to and fro, tiptoing up nearer heaven by the altitude of a
  8998	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchopine, and, covered by the noise of outgoing, said low:
  8999	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9000	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Is it your view, then, that she was not faithful to the poet?
  9001	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9002	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAlarmed face asks me. Why did he come? Courtesy or an inward light?
  9003	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9004	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Where there is a reconciliation, Stephen said, there must have been
  9005	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfirst a sundering.
  9006	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9007	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes.
  9008	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9009	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tChristfox in leather trews, hiding, a runaway in blighted treeforks,
  9010	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom hue and cry. Knowing no vixen, walking lonely in the chase. Women
  9011	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the won to him, tender people, a whore of Babylon, ladies of justices,
  9012	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbully tapsters’ wives. Fox and geese. And in New Place a slack
  9013	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdishonoured body that once was comely, once as sweet, as fresh as
  9014	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcinnamon, now her leaves falling, all, bare, frighted of the narrow
  9015	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgrave and unforgiven.
  9016	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9017	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes. So you think...

  9019	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe door closed behind the outgoer.
  9020	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t

  9032	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThoth, god of libraries, a birdgod, moonycrowned. And I heard the voice

  9034	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9035	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey are still. Once quick in the brains of men. Still: but an itch of
  9036	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdeath is in them, to tell me in my ear a maudlin tale, urge me to wreak
  9037	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir will.
  9038	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9039	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Certainly, John Eglinton mused, of all great men he is the most
  9040	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tenigmatic. We know nothing but that he lived and suffered. Not even so
  9041	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmuch. Others abide our question. A shadow hangs over all the rest.
  9042	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9043	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—But Hamlet is so personal, isn’t it? Mr Best pleaded. I mean, a kind of
  9044	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprivate paper, don’t you know, of his private life. I mean, I don’t care
  9045	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta button, don’t you know, who is killed or who is guilty...
  9046	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9047	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe rested an innocent book on the edge of the desk, smiling his
  9048	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdefiance. His private papers in the original. Ta an bad ar an tir. Taim

  9051	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tQuoth littlejohn Eglinton:
  9052	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9053	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I was prepared for paradoxes from what Malachi Mulligan told us but
  9054	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI may as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that
  9055	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShakespeare is Hamlet you have a stern task before you.

  9057	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBear with me.
  9058	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9059	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes glinting stern under
  9060	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twrinkled brows. A basilisk. E quando vede l’uomo l’attosca. Messer
  9061	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBrunetto, I thank thee for the word.
  9062	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9063	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—As we, or mother Dana, weave and unweave our bodies, Stephen said,
  9064	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom day to day, their molecules shuttled to and fro, so does the artist
  9065	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tweave and unweave his image. And as the mole on my right breast is where
  9066	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit was when I was born, though all my body has been woven of new stuff
  9067	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttime after time, so through the ghost of the unquiet father the image
  9068	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the unliving son looks forth. In the intense instant of imagination,
  9069	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhen the mind, Shelley says, is a fading coal, that which I was is that
  9070	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhich I am and that which in possibility I may come to be. So in the
  9071	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfuture, the sister of the past, I may see myself as I sit here now but
  9072	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby reflection from that which then I shall be.
  9073	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9074	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDrummond of Hawthornden helped you at that stile.
  9075	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9076	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, Mr Best said youngly. I feel Hamlet quite young. The bitterness
  9077	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmight be from the father but the passages with Ophelia are surely from
  9078	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe son.
  9079	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9080	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHas the wrong sow by the lug. He is in my father. I am in his son.
  9081	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9082	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That mole is the last to go, Stephen said, laughing.
  9083	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9084	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJohn Eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow.
  9085	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9086	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—If that were the birthmark of genius, he said, genius would be a
  9087	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdrug in the market. The plays of Shakespeare’s later years which Renan
  9088	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tadmired so much breathe another spirit.
  9089	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9090	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The spirit of reconciliation, the quaker librarian breathed.
  9091	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9092	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—There can be no reconciliation, Stephen said, if there has not been a
  9093	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsundering.
  9094	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9095	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSaid that.
  9096	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9097	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—If you want to know what are the events which cast their shadow over
  9098	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe hell of time of King Lear, Othello, Hamlet, Troilus and Cressida,
  9099	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlook to see when and how the shadow lifts. What softens the heart of a
  9100	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tman, shipwrecked in storms dire, Tried, like another Ulysses, Pericles,
  9101	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprince of Tyre?

  9106	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9107	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The leaning of sophists towards the bypaths of apocrypha is a constant
  9108	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tquantity, John Eglinton detected. The highroads are dreary but they lead
  9109	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto the town.
  9110	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9111	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGood Bacon: gone musty. Shakespeare Bacon’s wild oats. Cypherjugglers

  9119	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9120	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Mr Brandes accepts it, Stephen said, as the first play of the closing
  9121	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tperiod.
  9122	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9123	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Does he? What does Mr Sidney Lee, or Mr Simon Lazarus as some aver his
  9124	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tname is, say of it?
  9125	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9126	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Marina, Stephen said, a child of storm, Miranda, a wonder, Perdita,
  9127	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat which was lost. What was lost is given back to him: his daughter’s
  9128	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchild. My dearest wife, Pericles says, was like this maid. Will any man
  9129	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlove the daughter if he has not loved the mother?
  9130	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9131	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The art of being a grandfather, Mr Best gan murmur. L’art d’être
  9132	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgrand...
  9133	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9134	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Will he not see reborn in her, with the memory of his own youth added,

  9136	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9137	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDo you know what you are talking about? Love, yes. Word known to all
  9138	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmen. Amor vero aliquid alicui bonum vult unde et ea quae concupiscimus
  9139	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t...
  9140	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9141	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—His own image to a man with that queer thing genius is the standard of
  9142	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall experience, material and moral. Such an appeal will touch him. The
  9143	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\timages of other males of his blood will repel him. He will see in them
  9144	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgrotesque attempts of nature to foretell or to repeat himself.
  9145	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9146	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope.
  9147	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9148	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I hope Mr Dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of
  9149	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe public. And we ought to mention another Irish commentator, Mr George
  9150	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBernard Shaw. Nor should we forget Mr Frank Harris. His articles on
  9151	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShakespeare in the Saturday Review were surely brilliant. Oddly enough
  9152	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of the
  9153	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsonnets. The favoured rival is William Herbert, earl of Pembroke. I own
  9154	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat if the poet must be rejected such a rejection would seem more in
  9155	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tharmony with—what shall I say?—our notions of what ought not to have
  9156	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeen.
  9157	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9158	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFelicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them, auk’s egg, prize

  9162	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlove thy man?
  9163	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9164	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That may be too, Stephen said. There’s a saying of Goethe’s which Mr
  9165	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMagee likes to quote. Beware of what you wish for in youth because you
  9166	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twill get it in middle life. Why does he send to one who is a buonaroba,
  9167	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta bay where all men ride, a maid of honour with a scandalous girlhood, a
  9168	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlordling to woo for him? He was himself a lord of language and had made
  9169	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thimself a coistrel gentleman and he had written Romeo and Juliet.
  9170	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhy? Belief in himself has been untimely killed. He was overborne in a
  9171	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcornfield first (ryefield, I should say) and he will never be a victor
  9172	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin his own eyes after nor play victoriously the game of laugh and lie
  9173	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdown. Assumed dongiovannism will not save him. No later undoing will
  9174	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tundo the first undoing. The tusk of the boar has wounded him there where
  9175	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlove lies ableeding. If the shrew is worsted yet there remains to her
  9176	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twoman’s invisible weapon. There is, I feel in the words, some goad of
  9177	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe flesh driving him into a new passion, a darker shadow of the first,
  9178	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdarkening even his own understanding of himself. A like fate awaits him
  9179	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand the two rages commingle in a whirlpool.
  9180	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9181	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey list. And in the porches of their ears I pour.
  9182	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9183	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The soul has been before stricken mortally, a poison poured in the
  9184	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tporch of a sleeping ear. But those who are done to death in sleep cannot
  9185	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknow the manner of their quell unless their Creator endow their souls
  9186	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith that knowledge in the life to come. The poisoning and the beast
  9187	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith two backs that urged it King Hamlet’s ghost could not know of were
  9188	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the not endowed with knowledge by his creator. That is why the speech
  9189	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t(his lean unlovely English) is always turned elsewhere, backward.
  9190	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRavisher and ravished, what he would but would not, go with him from
  9191	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLucrece’s bluecircled ivory globes to Imogen’s breast, bare, with its
  9192	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmole cinquespotted. He goes back, weary of the creation he has piled up
  9193	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto hide him from himself, an old dog licking an old sore. But, because
  9194	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tloss is his gain, he passes on towards eternity in undiminished
  9195	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpersonality, untaught by the wisdom he has written or by the laws he
  9196	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thas revealed. His beaver is up. He is a ghost, a shadow now, the wind by
  9197	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tElsinore’s rocks or what you will, the sea’s voice, a voice heard
  9198	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tonly in the heart of him who is the substance of his shadow, the son
  9199	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconsubstantial with the father.

  9213	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPrimrosevested he greeted gaily with his doffed Panama as with a bauble.

  9230	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\taquiring.
  9231	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9232	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, indeed, the quaker librarian said. A most instructive discussion.
  9233	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Mulligan, I’ll be bound, has his theory too of the play and of
  9234	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShakespeare. All sides of life should be represented.
  9235	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9236	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe smiled on all sides equally.
  9237	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9238	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBuck Mulligan thought, puzzled:
  9239	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9240	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Shakespeare? he said. I seem to know the name.
  9241	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9242	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features.
  9243	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9244	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—To be sure, he said, remembering brightly. The chap that writes like
  9245	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSynge.
  9246	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9247	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Best turned to him.
  9248	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9249	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Haines missed you, he said. Did you meet him? He’ll see you after at
  9250	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe D. B. C. He’s gone to Gill’s to buy Hyde’s Lovesongs of Connacht.
  9251	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9252	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I came through the museum, Buck Mulligan said. Was he here?
  9253	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9254	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The bard’s fellowcountrymen, John Eglinton answered, are rather tired
  9255	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tperhaps of our brilliancies of theorising. I hear that an actress played
  9256	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in Dublin. Vining
  9257	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\theld that the prince was a woman. Has no-one made him out to be an
  9258	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIrishman? Judge Barton, I believe, is searching for some clues. He
  9259	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tswears (His Highness not His Lordship) by saint Patrick.
  9260	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9261	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The most brilliant of all is that story of Wilde’s, Mr Best said,
  9262	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlifting his brilliant notebook. That Portrait of Mr W. H. where he
  9263	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tproves that the sonnets were written by a Willie Hughes, a man all hues.
  9264	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9265	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—For Willie Hughes, is it not? the quaker librarian asked.
  9266	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9267	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOr Hughie Wills? Mr William Himself. W. H.: who am I?
  9268	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9269	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I mean, for Willie Hughes, Mr Best said, amending his gloss easily. Of
  9270	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcourse it’s all paradox, don’t you know, Hughes and hews and hues,
  9271	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe colour, but it’s so typical the way he works it out. It’s the very
  9272	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tessence of Wilde, don’t you know. The light touch.
  9273	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9274	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled, a blond ephebe.
  9275	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTame essence of Wilde.
  9276	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9277	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tYou’re darned witty. Three drams of usquebaugh you drank with Dan

  9283	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t

  9291	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9292	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Do you think it is only a paradox? the quaker librarian was asking. The
  9293	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious.
  9294	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9295	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey talked seriously of mocker’s seriousness.
  9296	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9297	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBuck Mulligan’s again heavy face eyed Stephen awhile. Then, his head
  9298	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twagging, he came near, drew a folded telegram from his pocket. His
  9299	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmobile lips read, smiling with new delight.
  9300	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9301	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Telegram! he said. Wonderful inspiration! Telegram! A papal bull!
  9302	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9303	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe sat on a corner of the unlit desk, reading aloud joyfully:
  9304	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t

  9311	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9312	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJoyfully he thrust message and envelope into a pocket but keened in a
  9313	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tquerulous brogue:
  9314	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9315	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—It’s what I’m telling you, mister honey, it’s queer and sick we were,
  9316	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHaines and myself, the time himself brought it in. ‘Twas murmur we did
  9317	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor a gallus potion would rouse a friar, I’m thinking, and he limp with

  9321	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe wailed:
  9322	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9323	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And we to be there, mavrone, and you to be unbeknownst sending us your
  9324	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconglomerations the way we to have our tongues out a yard long like the
  9325	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdrouthy clerics do be fainting for a pussful.
  9326	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9327	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen laughed.
  9328	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9329	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tQuickly, warningfully Buck Mulligan bent down.
  9330	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9331	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The tramper Synge is looking for you, he said, to murder you. He heard
  9332	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou pissed on his halldoor in Glasthule. He’s out in pampooties to
  9333	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmurder you.
  9334	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9335	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Me! Stephen exclaimed. That was your contribution to literature.
  9336	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9337	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBuck Mulligan gleefully bent back, laughing to the dark eavesdropping
  9338	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tceiling.
  9339	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9340	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Murder you! he laughed.
  9341	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9342	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHarsh gargoyle face that warred against me over our mess of hash
  9343	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof lights in rue Saint-André-des-Arts. In words of words for words,

  9345	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrandishing a winebottle. C’est vendredi saint! Murthering Irish. His
  9346	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\timage, wandering, he met. I mine. I met a fool i’the forest.
  9347	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9348	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Mr Lyster, an attendant said from the door ajar.
  9349	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9350	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—... in which everyone can find his own. So Mr Justice Madden in his
  9351	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDiary of Master William Silence has found the hunting terms... Yes? What
  9352	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tis it?
  9353	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9354	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—There’s a gentleman here, sir, the attendant said, coming forward and
  9355	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\toffering a card. From the Freeman. He wants to see the files of the
  9356	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKilkenny People for last year.
  9357	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9358	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Certainly, certainly, certainly. Is the gentleman?...
  9359	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9360	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe took the eager card, glanced, not saw, laid down unglanced, looked,
  9361	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tasked, creaked, asked:
  9362	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9363	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Is he?... O, there!
  9364	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9365	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBrisk in a galliard he was off, out. In the daylit corridor he talked
  9366	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith voluble pains of zeal, in duty bound, most fair, most kind, most
  9367	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thonest broadbrim.
  9368	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9369	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—This gentleman? Freeman’s Journal? Kilkenny People? To be sure. Good
  9370	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tday, sir. Kilkenny... We have certainly...
  9371	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9372	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA patient silhouette waited, listening.
  9373	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9374	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—All the leading provincial... Northern Whig, Cork Examiner, Enniscorthy
  9375	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGuardian, 1903... Will you please?... Evans, conduct this gentleman...
  9376	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIf you just follow the atten... Or, please allow me... This way...
  9377	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPlease, sir...
  9378	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9379	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tVoluble, dutiful, he led the way to all the provincial papers, a bowing
  9380	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdark figure following his hasty heels.
  9381	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9382	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe door closed.
  9383	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9384	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The sheeny! Buck Mulligan cried.
  9385	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9386	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe jumped up and snatched the card.
  9387	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9388	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What’s his name? Ikey Moses? Bloom.
  9389	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9390	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe rattled on:
  9391	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9392	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Jehovah, collector of prepuces, is no more. I found him over in the
  9393	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmuseum where I went to hail the foamborn Aphrodite. The Greek mouth that
  9394	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thas never been twisted in prayer. Every day we must do homage to her.
  9395	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLife of life, thy lips enkindle.
  9396	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9397	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSuddenly he turned to Stephen:
  9398	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9399	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—He knows you. He knows your old fellow. O, I fear me, he is Greeker
  9400	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthan the Greeks. His pale Galilean eyes were upon her mesial groove.
  9401	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tVenus Kallipyge. O, the thunder of those loins! The god pursuing the
  9402	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmaiden hid.
  9403	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9404	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—We want to hear more, John Eglinton decided with Mr Best’s approval. We
  9405	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbegin to be interested in Mrs S. Till now we had thought of her, if at
  9406	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall, as a patient Griselda, a Penelope stayathome.
  9407	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9408	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Antisthenes, pupil of Gorgias, Stephen said, took the palm of beauty
  9409	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom Kyrios Menelaus’ brooddam, Argive Helen, the wooden mare of Troy
  9410	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin whom a score of heroes slept, and handed it to poor Penelope. Twenty
  9411	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyears he lived in London and, during part of that time, he drew a salary
  9412	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tequal to that of the lord chancellor of Ireland. His life was rich. His
  9413	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tart, more than the art of feudalism as Walt Whitman called it, is the
  9414	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tart of surfeit. Hot herringpies, green mugs of sack, honeysauces, sugar
  9415	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof roses, marchpane, gooseberried pigeons, ringocandies. Sir Walter
  9416	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRaleigh, when they arrested him, had half a million francs on his
  9417	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tback including a pair of fancy stays. The gombeenwoman Eliza Tudor had
  9418	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunderlinen enough to vie with her of Sheba. Twenty years he dallied
  9419	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthere between conjugial love and its chaste delights and scortatory love
  9420	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand its foul pleasures. You know Manningham’s story of the burgher’s
  9421	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twife who bade Dick Burbage to her bed after she had seen him in Richard
  9422	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIII and how Shakespeare, overhearing, without more ado about nothing,
  9423	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttook the cow by the horns and, when Burbage came knocking at the gate,
  9424	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanswered from the capon’s blankets: William the conqueror came before
  9425	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRichard III. And the gay lakin, mistress Fitton, mount and cry O, and
  9426	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this dainty birdsnies, lady Penelope Rich, a clean quality woman is
  9427	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuited for a player, and the punks of the bankside, a penny a time.
  9428	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9429	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCours la Reine. Encore vingt sous. Nous ferons de petites cochonneries.
  9430	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMinette? Tu veux?
  9431	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9432	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The height of fine society. And sir William Davenant of Oxford’s mother
  9433	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith her cup of canary for any cockcanary.
  9434	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9435	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBuck Mulligan, his pious eyes upturned, prayed:
  9436	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9437	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Blessed Margaret Mary Anycock!
  9438	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9439	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And Harry of six wives’ daughter. And other lady friends from neighbour
  9440	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseats as Lawn Tennyson, gentleman poet, sings. But all those twenty
  9441	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyears what do you suppose poor Penelope in Stratford was doing behind
  9442	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe diamond panes?
  9443	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9444	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDo and do. Thing done. In a rosery of Fetter lane of Gerard, herbalist,
  9445	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the walks, greyedauburn. An azured harebell like her veins. Lids of
  9446	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJuno’s eyes, violets. He walks. One life is all. One body. Do. But do.
  9447	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAfar, in a reek of lust and squalor, hands are laid on whiteness.
  9448	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9449	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBuck Mulligan rapped John Eglinton’s desk sharply.
  9450	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9451	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Whom do you suspect? he challenged.
  9452	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9453	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Say that he is the spurned lover in the sonnets. Once spurned twice
  9454	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspurned. But the court wanton spurned him for a lord, his dearmylove.
  9455	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9456	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLove that dare not speak its name.
  9457	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9458	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—As an Englishman, you mean, John sturdy Eglinton put in, he loved a
  9459	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlord.
  9460	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9461	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOld wall where sudden lizards flash. At Charenton I watched them.
  9462	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9463	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—It seems so, Stephen said, when he wants to do for him, and for all
  9464	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tother and singular uneared wombs, the holy office an ostler does for the
  9465	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstallion. Maybe, like Socrates, he had a midwife to mother as he had a
  9466	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshrew to wife. But she, the giglot wanton, did not break a bedvow. Two
  9467	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdeeds are rank in that ghost’s mind: a broken vow and the dullbrained
  9468	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyokel on whom her favour has declined, deceased husband’s brother. Sweet
  9469	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnn, I take it, was hot in the blood. Once a wooer, twice a wooer.
  9470	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9471	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen turned boldly in his chair.
  9472	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9473	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The burden of proof is with you not with me, he said frowning. If you
  9474	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdeny that in the fifth scene of Hamlet he has branded her with infamy
  9475	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttell me why there is no mention of her during the thirtyfour years
  9476	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbetween the day she married him and the day she buried him. All those
  9477	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twomen saw their men down and under: Mary, her goodman John, Ann, her
  9478	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpoor dear Willun, when he went and died on her, raging that he was the
  9479	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfirst to go, Joan, her four brothers, Judith, her husband and all her
  9480	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsons, Susan, her husband too, while Susan’s daughter, Elizabeth, to use
  9481	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgranddaddy’s words, wed her second, having killed her first.
  9482	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9483	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tO, yes, mention there is. In the years when he was living richly in
  9484	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\troyal London to pay a debt she had to borrow forty shillings from her
  9485	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfather’s shepherd. Explain you then. Explain the swansong too wherein he
  9486	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thas commended her to posterity.
  9487	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9488	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe faced their silence.
  9489	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9490	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     To whom thus Eglinton:
  9491	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     You mean the will.
  9492	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     But that has been explained, I believe, by jurists.
  9493	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     She was entitled to her widow’s dower
  9494	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     At common law. His legal knowledge was great
  9495	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     Our judges tell us.
  9496	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     Him Satan fleers,
  9497	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     Mocker:
  9498	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     And therefore he left out her name
  9499	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     From the first draft but he did not leave out
  9500	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     The presents for his granddaughter, for his daughters,
  9501	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     For his sister, for his old cronies in Stratford
  9502	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     And in London. And therefore when he was urged,
  9503	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     As I believe, to name her
  9504	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     He left her his
  9505	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     Secondbest
  9506	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     Bed.
  9507	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t

  9516	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9517	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWoa!
  9518	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9519	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Pretty countryfolk had few chattels then, John Eglinton observed, as
  9520	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey have still if our peasant plays are true to type.
  9521	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9522	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—He was a rich country gentleman, Stephen said, with a coat of arms and
  9523	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlanded estate at Stratford and a house in Ireland yard, a capitalist
  9524	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshareholder, a bill promoter, a tithefarmer. Why did he not leave her
  9525	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this best bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in
  9526	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpeace?
  9527	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9528	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—It is clear that there were two beds, a best and a secondbest, Mr
  9529	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSecondbest Best said finely.
  9530	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9531	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Separatio a mensa et a thalamo, bettered Buck Mulligan and was smiled
  9532	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton.
  9533	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9534	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Antiquity mentions famous beds, Second Eglinton puckered, bedsmiling.
  9535	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLet me think.
  9536	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9537	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Antiquity mentions that Stagyrite schoolurchin and bald heathen sage,
  9538	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen said, who when dying in exile frees and endows his slaves, pays
  9539	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttribute to his elders, wills to be laid in earth near the bones of his
  9540	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdead wife and bids his friends be kind to an old mistress (don’t forget
  9541	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNell Gwynn Herpyllis) and let her live in his villa.
  9542	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9543	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Do you mean he died so? Mr Best asked with slight concern. I mean...
  9544	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9545	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—He died dead drunk, Buck Mulligan capped. A quart of ale is a dish for
  9546	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta king. O, I must tell you what Dowden said!
  9547	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9548	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What? asked Besteglinton.
  9549	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9550	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWilliam Shakespeare and company, limited. The people’s William. For
  9551	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tterms apply: E. Dowden, Highfield house...
  9552	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9553	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Lovely! Buck Mulligan suspired amorously. I asked him what he thought
  9554	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the charge of pederasty brought against the bard. He lifted his
  9555	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thands and said: All we can say is that life ran very high in those days.
  9556	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLovely!
  9557	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9558	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCatamite.
  9559	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9560	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The sense of beauty leads us astray, said beautifulinsadness Best to
  9561	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tugling Eglinton.
  9562	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9563	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSteadfast John replied severe:
  9564	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9565	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The doctor can tell us what those words mean. You cannot eat your cake
  9566	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand have it.
  9567	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9568	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSayest thou so? Will they wrest from us, from me, the palm of beauty?
  9569	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9570	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And the sense of property, Stephen said. He drew Shylock out of his own
  9571	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlong pocket. The son of a maltjobber and moneylender he was himself a
  9572	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcornjobber and moneylender, with ten tods of corn hoarded in the famine
  9573	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\triots. His borrowers are no doubt those divers of worship mentioned
  9574	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby Chettle Falstaff who reported his uprightness of dealing. He sued a
  9575	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfellowplayer for the price of a few bags of malt and exacted his pound
  9576	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof flesh in interest for every money lent. How else could Aubrey’s
  9577	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tostler and callboy get rich quick? All events brought grist to his
  9578	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmill. Shylock chimes with the jewbaiting that followed the hanging and
  9579	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tquartering of the queen’s leech Lopez, his jew’s heart being plucked
  9580	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tforth while the sheeny was yet alive: Hamlet and Macbeth with the coming

  9869	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9870	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Mr Lyster! Father Dineen wants...
  9871	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9872	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O, Father Dineen! Directly.
  9873	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9874	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSwiftly rectly creaking rectly rectly he was rectly gone.
  9875	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9876	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJohn Eglinton touched the foil.
  9877	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9878	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Come, he said. Let us hear what you have to say of Richard and Edmund.
  9879	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tYou kept them for the last, didn’t you?
  9880	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9881	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—In asking you to remember those two noble kinsmen nuncle Richie and
  9882	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnuncle Edmund, Stephen answered, I feel I am asking too much perhaps. A
  9883	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrother is as easily forgotten as an umbrella.
  9884	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9885	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLapwing.
  9886	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9887	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhere is your brother? Apothecaries’ hall. My whetstone. Him, then
  9888	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCranly, Mulligan: now these. Speech, speech. But act. Act speech. They
  9889	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmock to try you. Act. Be acted on.
  9890	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9891	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLapwing.
  9892	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9893	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI am tired of my voice, the voice of Esau. My kingdom for a drink.
  9894	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9895	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOn.
  9896	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9897	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You will say those names were already in the chronicles from which he
  9898	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttook the stuff of his plays. Why did he take them rather than others?
  9899	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRichard, a whoreson crookback, misbegotten, makes love to a widowed Ann
  9900	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t(what’s in a name?), woos and wins her, a whoreson merry widow. Richard
  9901	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe conqueror, third brother, came after William the conquered. The
  9902	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tother four acts of that play hang limply from that first. Of all his
  9903	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tkings Richard is the only king unshielded by Shakespeare’s reverence,
  9904	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe angel of the world. Why is the underplot of King Lear in which
  9905	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEdmund figures lifted out of Sidney’s Arcadia and spatchcocked on to a
  9906	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCeltic legend older than history?
  9907	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9908	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That was Will’s way, John Eglinton defended. We should not now combine
  9909	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta Norse saga with an excerpt from a novel by George Meredith. Que
  9910	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvoulez-vous? Moore would say. He puts Bohemia on the seacoast and makes
  9911	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tUlysses quote Aristotle.
  9912	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9913	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Why? Stephen answered himself. Because the theme of the false or
  9914	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe usurping or the adulterous brother or all three in one is to
  9915	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShakespeare, what the poor are not, always with him. The note of
  9916	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbanishment, banishment from the heart, banishment from home, sounds
  9917	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tuninterruptedly from The Two Gentlemen of Verona onward till Prospero
  9918	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbreaks his staff, buries it certain fathoms in the earth and drowns his
  9919	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbook. It doubles itself in the middle of his life, reflects itself in
  9920	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanother, repeats itself, protasis, epitasis, catastasis, catastrophe.
  9921	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIt repeats itself again when he is near the grave, when his married
  9922	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdaughter Susan, chip of the old block, is accused of adultery. But it
  9923	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas the original sin that darkened his understanding, weakened his will
  9924	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand left in him a strong inclination to evil. The words are those of
  9925	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmy lords bishops of Maynooth. An original sin and, like original sin,
  9926	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcommitted by another in whose sin he too has sinned. It is between the
  9927	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlines of his last written words, it is petrified on his tombstone under
  9928	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhich her four bones are not to be laid. Age has not withered it. Beauty
  9929	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand peace have not done it away. It is in infinite variety everywhere
  9930	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the world he has created, in Much Ado about Nothing, twice in As you
  9931	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlike It, in The Tempest, in Hamlet, in Measure for Measure—and in all
  9932	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe other plays which I have not read.
  9933	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9934	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe laughed to free his mind from his mind’s bondage.
  9935	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9936	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJudge Eglinton summed up.
  9937	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9938	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The truth is midway, he affirmed. He is the ghost and the prince. He is
  9939	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall in all.
  9940	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9941	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—He is, Stephen said. The boy of act one is the mature man of act five.
  9942	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAll in all. In Cymbeline, in Othello he is bawd and cuckold. He acts and
  9943	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tis acted on. Lover of an ideal or a perversion, like José he kills the
  9944	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\treal Carmen. His unremitting intellect is the hornmad Iago ceaselessly
  9945	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twilling that the moor in him shall suffer.
  9946	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9947	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuck Mulligan clucked lewdly. O word of fear!
  9948	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9949	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDark dome received, reverbed.
  9950	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9951	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And what a character is Iago! undaunted John Eglinton exclaimed.
  9952	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen all is said Dumas fils (or is it Dumas père?) is right. After God
  9953	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShakespeare has created most.
  9954	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9955	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Man delights him not nor woman neither, Stephen said. He returns after
  9956	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta life of absence to that spot of earth where he was born, where he has
  9957	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\talways been, man and boy, a silent witness and there, his journey of
  9958	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlife ended, he plants his mulberrytree in the earth. Then dies. The
  9959	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmotion is ended. Gravediggers bury Hamlet père and Hamlet fils. A king
  9960	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand a prince at last in death, with incidental music. And, what though
  9961	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmurdered and betrayed, bewept by all frail tender hearts for, Dane or
  9962	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDubliner, sorrow for the dead is the only husband from whom they refuse
  9963	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto be divorced. If you like the epilogue look long on it: prosperous
  9964	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tProspero, the good man rewarded, Lizzie, grandpa’s lump of love, and
  9965	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnuncle Richie, the bad man taken off by poetic justice to the place
  9966	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhere the bad niggers go. Strong curtain. He found in the world without
  9967	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas actual what was in his world within as possible. Maeterlinck says:
  9968	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIf Socrates leave his house today he will find the sage seated on his
  9969	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdoorstep. If Judas go forth tonight it is to Judas his steps will tend.
  9970	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEvery life is many days, day after day. We walk through ourselves,
  9971	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmeeting robbers, ghosts, giants, old men, young men, wives, widows,
  9972	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrothers-in-love, but always meeting ourselves. The playwright who wrote
  9973	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe folio of this world and wrote it badly (He gave us light first and
  9974	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe sun two days later), the lord of things as they are whom the most
  9975	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRoman of catholics call dio boia, hangman god, is doubtless all in all
  9976	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin all of us, ostler and butcher, and would be bawd and cuckold too but
  9977	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat in the economy of heaven, foretold by Hamlet, there are no more
  9978	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmarriages, glorified man, an androgynous angel, being a wife unto
  9979	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thimself.
  9980	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9981	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Eureka! Buck Mulligan cried. Eureka!
  9982	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9983	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSuddenly happied he jumped up and reached in a stride John Eglinton’s
  9984	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdesk.
  9985	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9986	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—May I? he said. The Lord has spoken to Malachi.
  9987	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9988	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe began to scribble on a slip of paper.
  9989	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9990	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTake some slips from the counter going out.
  9991	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9992	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Those who are married, Mr Best, douce herald, said, all save one, shall
  9993	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlive. The rest shall keep as they are.
  9994	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9995	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe laughed, unmarried, at Eglinton Johannes, of arts a bachelor.
  9996	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
  9997	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tUnwed, unfancied, ware of wiles, they fingerponder nightly each his
  9998	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvariorum edition of The Taming of the Shrew.
  9999	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10000	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You are a delusion, said roundly John Eglinton to Stephen. You have
 10001	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrought us all this way to show us a French triangle. Do you believe
 10002	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyour own theory?
 10003	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10004	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—No, Stephen said promptly.
 10005	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10006	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Are you going to write it? Mr Best asked. You ought to make it a
 10007	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdialogue, don’t you know, like the Platonic dialogues Wilde wrote.
 10008	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10009	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJohn Eclecticon doubly smiled.
 10010	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10011	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Well, in that case, he said, I don’t see why you should expect payment
 10012	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor it since you don’t believe it yourself. Dowden believes there is
 10013	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsome mystery in Hamlet but will say no more. Herr Bleibtreu, the man
 10014	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPiper met in Berlin, who is working up that Rutland theory, believes
 10015	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat the secret is hidden in the Stratford monument. He is going to
 10016	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvisit the present duke, Piper says, and prove to him that his ancestor
 10017	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twrote the plays. It will come as a surprise to his grace. But he
 10018	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbelieves his theory.
 10019	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10020	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI believe, O Lord, help my unbelief. That is, help me to believe or help
 10021	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tme to unbelieve? Who helps to believe? Egomen. Who to unbelieve? Other
 10022	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchap.
 10023	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10024	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You are the only contributor to Dana who asks for pieces of silver.
 10025	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThen I don’t know about the next number. Fred Ryan wants space for an
 10026	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tarticle on economics.
 10027	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10028	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFraidrine. Two pieces of silver he lent me. Tide you over. Economics.
 10029	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10030	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—For a guinea, Stephen said, you can publish this interview.
 10031	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10032	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBuck Mulligan stood up from his laughing scribbling, laughing: and then
 10033	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgravely said, honeying malice:
 10034	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10035	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I called upon the bard Kinch at his summer residence in upper
 10036	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMecklenburgh street and found him deep in the study of the Summa contra
 10037	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGentiles in the company of two gonorrheal ladies, Fresh Nelly and
 10038	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRosalie, the coalquay whore.
 10039	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10040	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe broke away.
 10041	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10042	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Come, Kinch. Come, wandering Ængus of the birds.
 10043	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10044	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCome, Kinch. You have eaten all we left. Ay. I will serve you your orts
 10045	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand offals.
 10046	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10047	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen rose.
 10048	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10049	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLife is many days. This will end.
 10050	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10051	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—We shall see you tonight, John Eglinton said. Notre ami Moore says
 10052	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMalachi Mulligan must be there.
 10053	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10054	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBuck Mulligan flaunted his slip and panama.
 10055	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10056	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Monsieur Moore, he said, lecturer on French letters to the youth of
 10057	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIreland. I’ll be there. Come, Kinch, the bards must drink. Can you walk
 10058	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstraight?
 10059	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10060	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLaughing, he...
 10061	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10062	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSwill till eleven. Irish nights entertainment.
 10063	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10064	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLubber...
 10065	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10066	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen followed a lubber...
 10067	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10068	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOne day in the national library we had a discussion. Shakes. After. His
 10069	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlub back: I followed. I gall his kibe.
 10070	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10071	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen, greeting, then all amort, followed a lubber jester, a wellkempt
 10072	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thead, newbarbered, out of the vaulted cell into a shattering daylight of
 10073	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tno thought.
 10074	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10075	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhat have I learned? Of them? Of me?
 10076	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10077	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWalk like Haines now.

 10083	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O please do, sir... I shall be most pleased...
 10084	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10085	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAmused Buck Mulligan mused in pleasant murmur with himself, selfnodding:
 10086	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10087	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—A pleased bottom.
 10088	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10089	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe turnstile.
 10090	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10091	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIs that?... Blueribboned hat... Idly writing... What? Looked?...
 10092	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t

 10094	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10095	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPuck Mulligan, panamahelmeted, went step by step, iambing, trolling:
 10096	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10097	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t      John Eglinton, my jo, John,
 10098	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t      Why won’t you wed a wife?
 10099	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10100	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe spluttered to the air:
 10101	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10102	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O, the chinless Chinaman! Chin Chon Eg Lin Ton. We went over to their
 10103	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplaybox, Haines and I, the plumbers’ hall. Our players are creating a
 10104	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnew art for Europe like the Greeks or M. Maeterlinck. Abbey Theatre! I
 10105	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsmell the pubic sweat of monks.
 10106	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t

 10121	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10122	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPuck Mulligan footed featly, trilling:
 10123	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10124	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     I hardly hear the purlieu cry
 10125	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     Or a Tommy talk as I pass one by
 10126	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     Before my thoughts begin to run

 10138	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10139	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Mournful mummer, Buck Mulligan moaned. Synge has left off wearing black

 10144	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Longworth is awfully sick, he said, after what you wrote about that old

 10146	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton the paper and then you go and slate her drivel to Jaysus. Couldn’t

 10169	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10170	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe turned a happy patch’s smirk to Stephen, saying:
 10171	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10172	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The disguise, I fear, is thin. But listen.
 10173	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t

 10187	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10188	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe laughed, lolling a to and fro head, walking on, followed by Stephen:
 10189	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand mirthfully he told the shadows, souls of men:
 10190	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10191	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O, the night in the Camden hall when the daughters of Erin had to
 10192	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlift their skirts to step over you as you lay in your mulberrycoloured,
 10193	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmulticoloured, multitudinous vomit!
 10194	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10195	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The most innocent son of Erin, Stephen said, for whom they ever lifted

 10197	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10198	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAbout to pass through the doorway, feeling one behind, he stood aside.

 10215	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10216	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The wandering jew, Buck Mulligan whispered with clown’s awe. Did you

 10260	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10261	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFather Conmee crossed to Mountjoy square. He thought, but not for long,
 10262	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof soldiers and sailors, whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs,
 10263	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tending their days in some pauper ward, and of cardinal Wolsey’s words:
 10264	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIf I had served my God as I have served my king He would not have
 10265	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabandoned me in my old days. He walked by the treeshade of sunnywinking
 10266	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tleaves: and towards him came the wife of Mr David Sheehy M.P.
 10267	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10268	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Very well, indeed, father. And you, father?
 10269	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10270	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFather Conmee was wonderfully well indeed. He would go to Buxton
 10271	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprobably for the waters. And her boys, were they getting on well at
 10272	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBelvedere? Was that so? Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear that.
 10273	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd Mr Sheehy himself? Still in London. The house was still sitting, to
 10274	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbe sure it was. Beautiful weather it was, delightful indeed. Yes, it was
 10275	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvery probable that Father Bernard Vaughan would come again to preach. O,
 10276	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyes: a very great success. A wonderful man really.
 10277	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10278	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFather Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David Sheehy M.P.
 10279	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIooking so well and he begged to be remembered to Mr David Sheehy M.P.
 10280	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tYes, he would certainly call.
 10281	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10282	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Good afternoon, Mrs Sheehy.
 10283	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10284	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFather Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled, as he took leave, at the
 10285	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun. And smiled yet again,
 10286	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin going. He had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste.
 10287	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10288	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFather Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on Father

 10290	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10291	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Pilate! Wy don’t you old back that owlin mob?
 10292	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10293	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA zealous man, however. Really he was. And really did great good in his
 10294	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tway. Beyond a doubt. He loved Ireland, he said, and he loved the Irish.
 10295	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOf good family too would one think it? Welsh, were they not?
 10296	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10297	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tO, lest he forget. That letter to father provincial.
 10298	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10299	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFather Conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the corner of Mountjoy
 10300	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsquare. Yes: they were from Belvedere. The little house. Aha. And were
 10301	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey good boys at school? O. That was very good now. And what was his
 10302	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tname? Jack Sohan. And his name? Ger. Gallaher. And the other little man?
 10303	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis name was Brunny Lynam. O, that was a very nice name to have.
 10304	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10305	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFather Conmee gave a letter from his breast to Master Brunny Lynam and
 10306	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street.
 10307	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10308	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—But mind you don’t post yourself into the box, little man, he said.
 10309	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10310	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed:
 10311	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10312	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O, sir.
 10313	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10314	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Well, let me see if you can post a letter, Father Conmee said.
 10315	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10316	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMaster Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee’s letter
 10317	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox. Father
 10318	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tConmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square
 10319	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\teast.
 10320	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10321	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, in silk hat, slate

 10323	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttrousers, canary gloves and pointed patent boots, walking with grave
 10324	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdeportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady
 10325	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMaxwell at the corner of Dignam’s court.
 10326	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10327	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWas that not Mrs M’Guinness?
 10328	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10329	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMrs M’Guinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee from the
 10330	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfarther footpath along which she sailed. And Father Conmee smiled and
 10331	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaluted. How did she do?
 10332	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10333	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA fine carriage she had. Like Mary, queen of Scots, something. And to
 10334	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthink that she was a pawnbroker! Well, now! Such a... what should he
 10335	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsay?... such a queenly mien.
 10336	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10337	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFather Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced at the shutup
 10338	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfree church on his left. The reverend T. R. Greene B.A. will (D.V.)
 10339	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspeak. The incumbent they called him. He felt it incumbent on him to say
 10340	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta few words. But one should be charitable. Invincible ignorance. They
 10341	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tacted according to their lights.
 10342	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10343	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFather Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North Circular
 10344	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\troad. It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important
 10345	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthoroughfare. Surely, there ought to be.
 10346	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10347	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street. All
 10348	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\traised untidy caps. Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly.
 10349	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tChristian brother boys.
 10350	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10351	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFather Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked. Saint
 10352	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJoseph’s church, Portland row. For aged and virtuous females.
 10353	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFather Conmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament. Virtuous: but
 10354	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\toccasionally they were also badtempered.
 10355	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10356	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNear Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift
 10357	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnobleman. And now it was an office or something.
 10358	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10359	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFather Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was saluted
 10360	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby Mr William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop. Father
 10361	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tConmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived the odours that came
 10362	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom baconflitches and ample cools of butter. He passed Grogan’s the
 10363	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful
 10364	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcatastrophe in New York. In America those things were continually
 10365	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thappening. Unfortunate people to die like that, unprepared. Still, an
 10366	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tact of perfect contrition.
 10367	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10368	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFather Conmee went by Daniel Bergin’s publichouse against the window of
 10369	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhich two unlabouring men lounged. They saluted him and were saluted.
 10370	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10371	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFather Conmee passed H. J. O’Neill’s funeral establishment where Corny
 10372	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay.
 10373	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee saluted
 10374	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe constable. In Youkstetter’s, the porkbutcher’s, Father Conmee
 10375	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tobserved pig’s puddings, white and black and red, lie neatly curled in
 10376	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttubes.
 10377	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10378	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMoored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a
 10379	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tturfbarge, a towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty
 10380	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstraw seated amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above
 10381	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim. It was idyllic: and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of
 10382	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe Creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it
 10383	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor
 10384	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpeople.
 10385	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10386	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOn Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S. J. of saint Francis
 10387	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tXavier’s church, upper Gardiner street, stepped on to an outward bound
 10388	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttram.
 10389	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10390	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOff an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley C. C. of
 10391	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaint Agatha’s church, north William street, on to Newcomen bridge.
 10392	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10393	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAt Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for
 10394	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island.
 10395	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10396	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFather Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked with
 10397	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcare in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a sixpence
 10398	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse.
 10399	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPassing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually
 10400	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmade his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket. The
 10401	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsolemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father Conmee excessive
 10402	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor a journey so short and cheap. Father Conmee liked cheerful decorum.
 10403	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10404	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIt was a peaceful day. The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father
 10405	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tConmee had finished explaining and looked down. His wife, Father Conmee
 10406	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsupposed. A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with
 10407	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe glasses. She raised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so gently,
 10408	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily,
 10409	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsweetly.
 10410	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10411	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFather Conmee perceived her perfume in the car. He perceived also that
 10412	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the
 10413	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseat.
 10414	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10415	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFather Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the
 10416	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head.
 10417	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10418	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAt Annesley bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, an old
 10419	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twoman rose suddenly from her place to alight. The conductor pulled the
 10420	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbellstrap to stay the car for her. She passed out with her basket and
 10421	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta marketnet: and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and
 10422	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbasket down: and Father Conmee thought that, as she had nearly passed
 10423	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe end of the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had
 10424	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\talways to be told twice bless you, my child, that they have been
 10425	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabsolved, pray for me. But they had so many worries in life, so many
 10426	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcares, poor creatures.
 10427	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10428	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFrom the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at
 10429	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFather Conmee.
 10430	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10431	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFather Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and
 10432	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof his sermon on saint Peter Claver S. J. and the African mission and of
 10433	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and
 10434	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last
 10435	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thour came like a thief in the night. That book by the Belgian jesuit, Le
 10436	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNombre des Élus, seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea. Those were
 10437	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmillions of human souls created by God in His Own likeness to whom the
 10438	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfaith had not (D.V.) been brought. But they were God’s souls, created by
 10439	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGod. It seemed to Father Conmee a pity that they should all be lost, a
 10440	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twaste, if one might say.
 10441	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10442	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAt the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted, was saluted by the
 10443	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconductor and saluted in his turn.
 10444	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10445	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe Malahide road was quiet. It pleased Father Conmee, road and name.
 10446	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe joybells were ringing in gay Malahide. Lord Talbot de Malahide,
 10447	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\timmediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining.
 10448	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThen came the call to arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day.
 10449	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThose were old worldish days, loyal times in joyous townlands, old times
 10450	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the barony.
 10451	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10452	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFather Conmee, walking, thought of his little book Old Times in the
 10453	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBarony and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of
 10454	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMary Rochfort, daughter of lord Molesworth, first countess of Belvedere.
 10455	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10456	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough Ennel,
 10457	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMary, first countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in the evening,
 10458	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnot startled when an otter plunged. Who could know the truth? Not the
 10459	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjealous lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed
 10460	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tadultery fully, eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris, with her
 10461	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thusband’s brother? She would half confess if she had not all sinned as
 10462	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twomen did. Only God knew and she and he, her husband’s brother.
 10463	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10464	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFather Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed however for
 10465	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tman’s race on earth, and of the ways of God which were not our ways.
 10466	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10467	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDon John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore. He was humane and
 10468	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thonoured there. He bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at
 10469	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsmiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom, ceiled with full fruit
 10470	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tclusters. And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom, noble to noble,
 10471	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere impalmed by Don John Conmee.
 10472	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10473	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIt was a charming day.
 10474	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10475	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages,
 10476	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcurtseying to him with ample underleaves. The sky showed him a flock
 10477	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof small white clouds going slowly down the wind. Moutonner, the French
 10478	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaid. A just and homely word.
 10479	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10480	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFather Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoning clouds
 10481	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tover Rathcoffey. His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of
 10482	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tClongowes field. He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard
 10483	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe cries of the boys’ lines at their play, young cries in the quiet
 10484	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tevening. He was their rector: his reign was mild.
 10485	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10486	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFather Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out. An
 10487	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tivory bookmark told him the page.
 10488	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10489	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNones. He should have read that before lunch. But lady Maxwell had come.
 10490	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10491	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFather Conmee read in secret Pater and Ave and crossed his breast. Deus
 10492	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin adiutorium.
 10493	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10494	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe walked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading till he
 10495	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcame to Res in Beati immaculati: Principium verborum tuorum veritas: in
 10496	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\teternum omnia iudicia iustitiæ tuæ.
 10497	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10498	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a
 10499	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyoung woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand. The young man raised
 10500	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this cap abruptly: the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care
 10501	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdetached from her light skirt a clinging twig.
 10502	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10503	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFather Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his
 10504	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbreviary. Sin: Principes persecuti sunt me gratis: et a verbis tuis
 10505	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tformidavit cor meum.
 10506	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10507	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCorny Kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping eye
 10508	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner. He pulled himself erect,
 10509	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twent to it and, spinning it on its axle, viewed its shape and brass
 10510	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfurnishings. Chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came
 10511	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto the doorway. There he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes
 10512	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand leaned against the doorcase, looking idly out.
 10513	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10514	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFather John Conmee stepped into the Dollymount tram on Newcomen bridge.
 10515	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10516	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCorny Kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed, his hat
 10517	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdowntilted, chewing his blade of hay.
 10518	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10519	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tConstable 57C, on his beat, stood to pass the time of day.
 10520	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10521	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That’s a fine day, Mr Kelleher.
 10522	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10523	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ay, Corny Kelleher said.
 10524	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10525	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—It’s very close, the constable said.
 10526	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10527	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCorny Kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth
 10528	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhile a generous white arm from a window in Eccles street flung forth a
 10529	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcoin.
 10530	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10531	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What’s the best news? he asked.
 10532	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10533	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I seen that particular party last evening, the constable said with
 10534	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbated breath.
 10535	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10536	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA onelegged sailor crutched himself round MacConnell’s corner, skirting
 10537	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRabaiotti’s icecream car, and jerked himself up Eccles street. Towards
 10538	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLarry O’Rourke, in shirtsleeves in his doorway, he growled unamiably:
 10539	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10540	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—For England...
 10541	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10542	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe swung himself violently forward past Katey and Boody Dedalus, halted
 10543	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand growled:
 10544	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10545	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—home and beauty.
 10546	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10547	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJ. J. O’Molloy’s white careworn face was told that Mr Lambert was in the
 10548	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twarehouse with a visitor.
 10549	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10550	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA stout lady stopped, took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it
 10551	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinto the cap held out to her. The sailor grumbled thanks, glanced sourly
 10552	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat the unheeding windows, sank his head and swung himself forward four
 10553	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstrides.
 10554	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10555	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe halted and growled angrily:
 10556	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10557	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—For England...
 10558	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10559	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTwo barefoot urchins, sucking long liquorice laces, halted near him,
 10560	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths.
 10561	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10562	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe swung himself forward in vigorous jerks, halted, lifted his head
 10563	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttowards a window and bayed deeply:
 10564	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10565	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—home and beauty.
 10566	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10567	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two, ceased.
 10568	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe blind of the window was drawn aside. A card Unfurnished Apartments
 10569	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tslipped from the sash and fell. A plump bare generous arm shone, was
 10570	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseen, held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut shiftstraps. A
 10571	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twoman’s hand flung forth a coin over the area railings. It fell on the
 10572	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpath.
 10573	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10574	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOne of the urchins ran to it, picked it up and dropped it into the
 10575	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tminstrel’s cap, saying:
 10576	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10577	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—There, sir.
 10578	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10579	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKatey and Boody Dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming kitchen.
 10580	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10581	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Did you put in the books? Boody asked.
 10582	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10583	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMaggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds
 10584	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttwice with her potstick and wiped her brow.
 10585	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10586	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—They wouldn’t give anything on them, she said.
 10587	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10588	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFather Conmee walked through Clongowes fields, his thinsocked ankles
 10589	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttickled by stubble.
 10590	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10591	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Where did you try? Boody asked.
 10592	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10593	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—M’Guinness’s.
 10594	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10595	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBoody stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table.
 10596	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10597	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Bad cess to her big face! she cried.
 10598	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10599	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKatey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes.
 10600	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10601	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What’s in the pot? she asked.
 10602	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10603	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Shirts, Maggy said.
 10604	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10605	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBoody cried angrily:
 10606	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10607	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Crickey, is there nothing for us to eat?
 10608	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10609	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKatey, lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt, asked:
 10610	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10611	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And what’s in this?
 10612	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10613	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA heavy fume gushed in answer.
 10614	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10615	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Peasoup, Maggy said.
 10616	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10617	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Where did you get it? Katey asked.
 10618	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10619	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Sister Mary Patrick, Maggy said.
 10620	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10621	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe lacquey rang his bell.
 10622	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10623	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Barang!
 10624	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10625	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBoody sat down at the table and said hungrily:
 10626	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10627	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Give us it here.
 10628	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10629	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMaggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl. Katey,
 10630	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsitting opposite Boody, said quietly, as her fingertip lifted to her
 10631	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmouth random crumbs:
 10632	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10633	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—A good job we have that much. Where’s Dilly?
 10634	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10635	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Gone to meet father, Maggy said.
 10636	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10637	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBoody, breaking big chunks of bread into the yellow soup, added:
 10638	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10639	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Our father who art not in heaven.
 10640	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10641	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMaggy, pouring yellow soup in Katey’s bowl, exclaimed:
 10642	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10643	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Boody! For shame!
 10644	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10645	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA skiff, a crumpled throwaway, Elijah is coming, rode lightly down the
 10646	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLiffey, under Loopline bridge, shooting the rapids where water chafed
 10647	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\taround the bridgepiers, sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains,
 10648	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbetween the Customhouse old dock and George’s quay.
 10649	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10650	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe blond girl in Thornton’s bedded the wicker basket with rustling
 10651	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfibre. Blazes Boylan handed her the bottle swathed in pink tissue paper
 10652	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand a small jar.
 10653	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10654	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Put these in first, will you? he said.
 10655	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10656	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, sir, the blond girl said. And the fruit on top.
 10657	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10658	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That’ll do, game ball, Blazes Boylan said.
 10659	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10660	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe bestowed fat pears neatly, head by tail, and among them ripe
 10661	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshamefaced peaches.
 10662	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10663	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBlazes Boylan walked here and there in new tan shoes about the
 10664	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfruitsmelling shop, lifting fruits, young juicy crinkled and plump red
 10665	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttomatoes, sniffing smells.
 10666	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10667	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tH. E. L. Y.‘S filed before him, tallwhitehatted, past Tangier lane,
 10668	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplodding towards their goal.
 10669	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10670	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe turned suddenly from a chip of strawberries, drew a gold watch from
 10671	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this fob and held it at its chain’s length.
 10672	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10673	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Can you send them by tram? Now?
 10674	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10675	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA darkbacked figure under Merchants’ arch scanned books on the hawker’s
 10676	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcart.
 10677	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10678	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Certainly, sir. Is it in the city?
 10679	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10680	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O, yes, Blazes Boylan said. Ten minutes.
 10681	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10682	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe blond girl handed him a docket and pencil.
 10683	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10684	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Will you write the address, sir?
 10685	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10686	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBlazes Boylan at the counter wrote and pushed the docket to her.
 10687	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10688	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Send it at once, will you? he said. It’s for an invalid.
 10689	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10690	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, sir. I will, sir.
 10691	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10692	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBlazes Boylan rattled merry money in his trousers’ pocket.
 10693	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10694	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What’s the damage? he asked.
 10695	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10696	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe blond girl’s slim fingers reckoned the fruits.
 10697	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10698	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBlazes Boylan looked into the cut of her blouse. A young pullet. He took
 10699	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta red carnation from the tall stemglass.
 10700	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10701	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—This for me? he asked gallantly.
 10702	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10703	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe blond girl glanced sideways at him, got up regardless, with his tie
 10704	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta bit crooked, blushing.
 10705	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10706	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, sir, she said.
 10707	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10708	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBending archly she reckoned again fat pears and blushing peaches.
 10709	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10710	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBlazes Boylan looked in her blouse with more favour, the stalk of the
 10711	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tred flower between his smiling teeth.
 10712	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10713	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—May I say a word to your telephone, missy? he asked roguishly.
 10714	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10715	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ma! Almidano Artifoni said.
 10716	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10717	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe gazed over Stephen’s shoulder at Goldsmith’s knobby poll.
 10718	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10719	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTwo carfuls of tourists passed slowly, their women sitting fore,
 10720	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgripping the handrests. Palefaces. Men’s arms frankly round their
 10721	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstunted forms. They looked from Trinity to the blind columned porch of
 10722	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe bank of Ireland where pigeons roocoocooed.
 10723	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10724	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Anch’io ho avuto di queste idee, Almidano Artifoni said, quand’ ero
 10725	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgiovine come Lei. Eppoi mi sono convinto che il mondo è una bestia.
 10726	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tÈ peccato. Perchè la sua voce... sarebbe un cespite di rendita, via.
 10727	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tInvece, Lei si sacrifica.
 10728	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10729	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Sacrifizio incruento, Stephen said smiling, swaying his ashplant in
 10730	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tslow swingswong from its midpoint, lightly.
 10731	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10732	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Speriamo, the round mustachioed face said pleasantly. Ma, dia retta a
 10733	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tme. Ci rifletta.
 10734	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10735	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBy the stern stone hand of Grattan, bidding halt, an Inchicore tram
 10736	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunloaded straggling Highland soldiers of a band.
 10737	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10738	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ci rifletterò, Stephen said, glancing down the solid trouserleg.
 10739	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10740	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ma, sul serio, eh? Almidano Artifoni said.
 10741	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10742	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis heavy hand took Stephen’s firmly. Human eyes. They gazed curiously
 10743	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tan instant and turned quickly towards a Dalkey tram.
 10744	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10745	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Eccolo, Almidano Artifoni said in friendly haste. Venga a trovarmi e ci
 10746	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpensi. Addio, caro.
 10747	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10748	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Arrivederla, maestro, Stephen said, raising his hat when his hand was
 10749	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfreed. E grazie.
 10750	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10751	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Di che? Almidano Artifoni said. Scusi, eh? Tante belle cose!
 10752	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10753	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAlmidano Artifoni, holding up a baton of rolled music as a signal,
 10754	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttrotted on stout trousers after the Dalkey tram. In vain he trotted,
 10755	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsignalling in vain among the rout of barekneed gillies smuggling
 10756	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\timplements of music through Trinity gates.
 10757	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10758	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMiss Dunne hid the Capel street library copy of The Woman in White
 10759	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfar back in her drawer and rolled a sheet of gaudy notepaper into her
 10760	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttypewriter.
 10761	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10762	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tToo much mystery business in it. Is he in love with that one, Marion?
 10763	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tChange it and get another by Mary Cecil Haye.
 10764	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10765	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe disk shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased and ogled them:
 10766	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsix.
 10767	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10768	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMiss Dunne clicked on the keyboard:
 10769	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10770	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—16 June 1904.
 10771	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10772	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFive tallwhitehatted sandwichmen between Monypeny’s corner and the slab
 10773	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhere Wolfe Tone’s statue was not, eeled themselves turning H. E. L.
 10774	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tY.‘S and plodded back as they had come.
 10775	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10776	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThen she stared at the large poster of Marie Kendall, charming
 10777	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsoubrette, and, listlessly lolling, scribbled on the jotter sixteens and
 10778	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcapital esses. Mustard hair and dauby cheeks. She’s not nicelooking,
 10779	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tis she? The way she’s holding up her bit of a skirt. Wonder will that
 10780	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfellow be at the band tonight. If I could get that dressmaker to make a
 10781	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconcertina skirt like Susy Nagle’s. They kick out grand. Shannon and
 10782	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall the boatclub swells never took his eyes off her. Hope to goodness he
 10783	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twon’t keep me here till seven.
 10784	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10785	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe telephone rang rudely by her ear.
 10786	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10787	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Hello. Yes, sir. No, sir. Yes, sir. I’ll ring them up after five. Only
 10788	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthose two, sir, for Belfast and Liverpool. All right, sir. Then I can go
 10789	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tafter six if you’re not back. A quarter after. Yes, sir. Twentyseven and
 10790	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsix. I’ll tell him. Yes: one, seven, six.
 10791	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10792	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe scribbled three figures on an envelope.
 10793	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10794	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Mr Boylan! Hello! That gentleman from Sport was in looking for you. Mr
 10795	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLenehan, yes. He said he’ll be in the Ormond at four. No, sir. Yes, sir.
 10796	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI’ll ring them up after five.
 10797	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10798	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTwo pink faces turned in the flare of the tiny torch.
 10799	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10800	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Who’s that? Ned Lambert asked. Is that Crotty?
 10801	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10802	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ringabella and Crosshaven, a voice replied groping for foothold.
 10803	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10804	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Hello, Jack, is that yourself? Ned Lambert said, raising in salute his
 10805	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpliant lath among the flickering arches. Come on. Mind your steps there.
 10806	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10807	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe vesta in the clergyman’s uplifted hand consumed itself in a long
 10808	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsoft flame and was let fall. At their feet its red speck died: and
 10809	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmouldy air closed round them.
 10810	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10811	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—How interesting! a refined accent said in the gloom.
 10812	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10813	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, sir, Ned Lambert said heartily. We are standing in the historic
 10814	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcouncil chamber of saint Mary’s abbey where silken Thomas proclaimed
 10815	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thimself a rebel in 1534. This is the most historic spot in all Dublin.
 10816	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tO’Madden Burke is going to write something about it one of these days.
 10817	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe old bank of Ireland was over the way till the time of the union and
 10818	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe original jews’ temple was here too before they built their synagogue
 10819	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tover in Adelaide road. You were never here before, Jack, were you?
 10820	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10821	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—No, Ned.
 10822	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10823	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—He rode down through Dame walk, the refined accent said, if my memory
 10824	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tserves me. The mansion of the Kildares was in Thomas court.
 10825	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10826	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That’s right, Ned Lambert said. That’s quite right, sir.
 10827	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10828	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—If you will be so kind then, the clergyman said, the next time to allow
 10829	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tme perhaps...
 10830	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10831	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Certainly, Ned Lambert said. Bring the camera whenever you like. I’ll
 10832	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tget those bags cleared away from the windows. You can take it from here
 10833	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tor from here.
 10834	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10835	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIn the still faint light he moved about, tapping with his lath the piled
 10836	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseedbags and points of vantage on the floor.
 10837	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10838	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFrom a long face a beard and gaze hung on a chessboard.
 10839	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10840	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I’m deeply obliged, Mr Lambert, the clergyman said. I won’t trespass on
 10841	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyour valuable time...
 10842	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10843	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You’re welcome, sir, Ned Lambert said. Drop in whenever you like. Next
 10844	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tweek, say. Can you see?
 10845	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10846	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, yes. Good afternoon, Mr Lambert. Very pleased to have met you.
 10847	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10848	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Pleasure is mine, sir, Ned Lambert answered.
 10849	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10850	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe followed his guest to the outlet and then whirled his lath away among
 10851	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe pillars. With J. J. O’Molloy he came forth slowly into Mary’s abbey
 10852	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhere draymen were loading floats with sacks of carob and palmnut meal,
 10853	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tO’Connor, Wexford.
 10854	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10855	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe stood to read the card in his hand.
 10856	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10857	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The reverend Hugh C. Love, Rathcoffey. Present address: Saint
 10858	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMichael’s, Sallins. Nice young chap he is. He’s writing a book about the
 10859	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFitzgeralds he told me. He’s well up in history, faith.
 10860	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10861	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe young woman with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging
 10862	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttwig.
 10863	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10864	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I thought you were at a new gunpowder plot, J. J. O’Molloy said.
 10865	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10866	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNed Lambert cracked his fingers in the air.
 10867	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10868	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—God! he cried. I forgot to tell him that one about the earl of Kildare
 10869	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tafter he set fire to Cashel cathedral. You know that one? I’m bloody
 10870	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsorry I did it, says he, but I declare to God I thought the archbishop
 10871	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas inside. He mightn’t like it, though. What? God, I’ll tell him
 10872	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanyhow. That was the great earl, the Fitzgerald Mor. Hot members they
 10873	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere all of them, the Geraldines.
 10874	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10875	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe horses he passed started nervously under their slack harness. He
 10876	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tslapped a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried:
 10877	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10878	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Woa, sonny!
 10879	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10880	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe turned to J. J. O’Molloy and asked:
 10881	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10882	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Well, Jack. What is it? What’s the trouble? Wait awhile. Hold hard.
 10883	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10884	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWith gaping mouth and head far back he stood still and, after an
 10885	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinstant, sneezed loudly.
 10886	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10887	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Chow! he said. Blast you!
 10888	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10889	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The dust from those sacks, J. J. O’Molloy said politely.
 10890	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10891	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—No, Ned Lambert gasped, I caught a... cold night before... blast your
 10892	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsoul... night before last... and there was a hell of a lot of draught...
 10893	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10894	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe held his handkerchief ready for the coming...
 10895	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10896	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I was... Glasnevin this morning... poor little... what do you call
 10897	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim... Chow!... Mother of Moses!
 10898	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10899	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTom Rochford took the top disk from the pile he clasped against his
 10900	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tclaret waistcoat.
 10901	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10902	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—See? he said. Say it’s turn six. In here, see. Turn Now On.
 10903	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10904	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe slid it into the left slot for them. It shot down the groove, wobbled
 10905	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta while, ceased, ogling them: six.
 10906	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10907	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLawyers of the past, haughty, pleading, beheld pass from the
 10908	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconsolidated taxing office to Nisi Prius court Richie Goulding carrying
 10909	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward and heard rustling from the
 10910	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tadmiralty division of king’s bench to the court of appeal an elderly
 10911	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfemale with false teeth smiling incredulously and a black silk skirt of
 10912	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgreat amplitude.
 10913	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10914	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—See? he said. See now the last one I put in is over here: Turns Over.
 10915	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe impact. Leverage, see?
 10916	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10917	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe showed them the rising column of disks on the right.
 10918	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10919	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Smart idea, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling. So a fellow coming in late can
 10920	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsee what turn is on and what turns are over.
 10921	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10922	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—See? Tom Rochford said.
 10923	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10924	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle, stop:
 10925	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfour. Turn Now On.
 10926	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10927	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I’ll see him now in the Ormond, Lenehan said, and sound him. One good
 10928	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tturn deserves another.
 10929	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10930	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Do, Tom Rochford said. Tell him I’m Boylan with impatience.
 10931	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10932	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Goodnight, M’Coy said abruptly. When you two begin...
 10933	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10934	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNosey Flynn stooped towards the lever, snuffling at it.
 10935	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10936	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—But how does it work here, Tommy? he asked.
 10937	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10938	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Tooraloo, Lenehan said. See you later.
 10939	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10940	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe followed M’Coy out across the tiny square of Crampton court.
 10941	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10942	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—He’s a hero, he said simply.
 10943	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10944	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I know, M’Coy said. The drain, you mean.
 10945	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10946	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Drain? Lenehan said. It was down a manhole.
 10947	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10948	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey passed Dan Lowry’s musichall where Marie Kendall, charming
 10949	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsoubrette, smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile.
 10950	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10951	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGoing down the path of Sycamore street beside the Empire musichall
 10952	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLenehan showed M’Coy how the whole thing was. One of those manholes like
 10953	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it, half
 10954	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchoked with sewer gas. Down went Tom Rochford anyhow, booky’s vest and
 10955	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall, with the rope round him. And be damned but he got the rope round
 10956	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe poor devil and the two were hauled up.
 10957	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10958	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The act of a hero, he said.
 10959	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10960	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAt the Dolphin they halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop past
 10961	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem for Jervis street.
 10962	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10963	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—This way, he said, walking to the right. I want to pop into Lynam’s
 10964	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto see Sceptre’s starting price. What’s the time by your gold watch and
 10965	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchain?
 10966	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10967	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tM’Coy peered into Marcus Tertius Moses’ sombre office, then at O’Neill’s
 10968	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tclock.
 10969	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10970	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—After three, he said. Who’s riding her?
 10971	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10972	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O. Madden, Lenehan said. And a game filly she is.
 10973	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10974	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhile he waited in Temple bar M’Coy dodged a banana peel with gentle
 10975	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpushes of his toe from the path to the gutter. Fellow might damn easy
 10976	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tget a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark.
 10977	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10978	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregal
 10979	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcavalcade.
 10980	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10981	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Even money, Lenehan said returning. I knocked against Bantam Lyons
 10982	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin there going to back a bloody horse someone gave him that hasn’t an
 10983	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tearthly. Through here.
 10984	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10985	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey went up the steps and under Merchants’ arch. A darkbacked figure
 10986	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tscanned books on the hawker’s cart.
 10987	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10988	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—There he is, Lenehan said.
 10989	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10990	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Wonder what he’s buying, M’Coy said, glancing behind.
 10991	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10992	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Leopoldo or the Bloom is on the Rye, Lenehan said.
 10993	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10994	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—He’s dead nuts on sales, M’Coy said. I was with him one day and he
 10995	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbought a book from an old one in Liffey street for two bob. There were
 10996	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfine plates in it worth double the money, the stars and the moon and
 10997	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcomets with long tails. Astronomy it was about.
 10998	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 10999	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLenehan laughed.
 11000	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11001	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I’ll tell you a damn good one about comets’ tails, he said. Come over
 11002	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the sun.
 11003	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11004	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey crossed to the metal bridge and went along Wellington quay by the
 11005	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\triverwall.
 11006	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11007	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMaster Patrick Aloysius Dignam came out of Mangan’s, late Fehrenbach’s,
 11008	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcarrying a pound and a half of porksteaks.
 11009	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11010	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—There was a long spread out at Glencree reformatory, Lenehan said
 11011	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\teagerly. The annual dinner, you know. Boiled shirt affair. The lord
 11012	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmayor was there, Val Dillon it was, and sir Charles Cameron and Dan
 11013	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDawson spoke and there was music. Bartell d’Arcy sang and Benjamin
 11014	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDollard...
 11015	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11016	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I know, M’Coy broke in. My missus sang there once.
 11017	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11018	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Did she? Lenehan said.
 11019	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11020	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA card Unfurnished Apartments reappeared on the windowsash of number 7
 11021	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEccles street.
 11022	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11023	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh.
 11024	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11025	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—But wait till I tell you, he said. Delahunt of Camden street had the
 11026	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcatering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher. Bloom and the wife were
 11027	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthere. Lashings of stuff we put up: port wine and sherry and curacao to
 11028	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhich we did ample justice. Fast and furious it was. After liquids came
 11029	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsolids. Cold joints galore and mince pies...
 11030	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11031	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I know, M’Coy said. The year the missus was there...
 11032	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11033	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLenehan linked his arm warmly.
 11034	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11035	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—But wait till I tell you, he said. We had a midnight lunch too after
 11036	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o’clock the
 11037	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmorning after the night before. Coming home it was a gorgeous winter’s
 11038	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnight on the Featherbed Mountain. Bloom and Chris Callinan were on one
 11039	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tside of the car and I was with the wife on the other. We started singing
 11040	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglees and duets: Lo, the early beam of morning. She was well primed
 11041	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith a good load of Delahunt’s port under her bellyband. Every jolt the
 11042	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbloody car gave I had her bumping up against me. Hell’s delights! She
 11043	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thas a fine pair, God bless her. Like that.
 11044	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11045	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe held his caved hands a cubit from him, frowning:
 11046	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11047	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time. Know
 11048	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhat I mean?
 11049	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11050	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis hands moulded ample curves of air. He shut his eyes tight in
 11051	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdelight, his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips.
 11052	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11053	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The lad stood to attention anyhow, he said with a sigh. She’s a gamey
 11054	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmare and no mistake. Bloom was pointing out all the stars and the comets
 11055	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the heavens to Chris Callinan and the jarvey: the great bear and
 11056	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHercules and the dragon, and the whole jingbang lot. But, by God, I was
 11057	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlost, so to speak, in the milky way. He knows them all, faith. At last
 11058	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe spotted a weeny weeshy one miles away. And what star is that, Poldy?
 11059	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsays she. By God, she had Bloom cornered. That one, is it? says Chris
 11060	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCallinan, sure that’s only what you might call a pinprick. By God, he
 11061	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twasn’t far wide of the mark.
 11062	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11063	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall, panting with soft laughter.
 11064	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11065	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I’m weak, he gasped.
 11066	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11067	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tM’Coy’s white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave. Lenehan
 11068	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twalked on again. He lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead
 11069	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trapidly. He glanced sideways in the sunlight at M’Coy.
 11070	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11071	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—He’s a cultured allroundman, Bloom is, he said seriously. He’s not one
 11072	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof your common or garden... you know... There’s a touch of the artist
 11073	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabout old Bloom.
 11074	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11075	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom turned over idly pages of The Awful Disclosures of Maria Monk,
 11076	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthen of Aristotle’s Masterpiece. Crooked botched print. Plates: infants
 11077	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of slaughtered cows.
 11078	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLots of them like that at this moment all over the world. All butting
 11079	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith their skulls to get out of it. Child born every minute somewhere.
 11080	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMrs Purefoy.
 11081	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11082	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe laid both books aside and glanced at the third: Tales of the Ghetto
 11083	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby Leopold von Sacher Masoch.
 11084	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11085	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That I had, he said, pushing it by.
 11086	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11087	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe shopman let two volumes fall on the counter.
 11088	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11089	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Them are two good ones, he said.
 11090	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11091	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOnions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth.
 11092	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe bent to make a bundle of the other books, hugged them against his
 11093	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain.
 11094	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11095	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOn O’Connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay
 11096	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tapparel of Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c.
 11097	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11098	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom, alone, looked at the titles. Fair Tyrants by James Lovebirch.
 11099	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKnow the kind that is. Had it? Yes.
 11100	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11101	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe opened it. Thought so.
 11102	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11103	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA woman’s voice behind the dingy curtain. Listen: the man.
 11104	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11105	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNo: she wouldn’t like that much. Got her it once.
 11106	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11107	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe read the other title: Sweets of Sin. More in her line. Let us see.
 11108	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11109	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe read where his finger opened.
 11110	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11111	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—All the dollarbills her husband gave her were spent in the stores on
 11112	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twondrous gowns and costliest frillies. For him! For Raoul!
 11113	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11114	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tYes. This. Here. Try.
 11115	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11116	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Her mouth glued on his in a luscious voluptuous kiss while his hands
 11117	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfelt for the opulent curves inside her déshabillé.
 11118	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11119	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tYes. Take this. The end.
 11120	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11121	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You are late, he spoke hoarsely, eying her with a suspicious glare.
 11122	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11123	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap, displaying her
 11124	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tqueenly shoulders and heaving embonpoint. An imperceptible smile played
 11125	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tround her perfect lips as she turned to him calmly.
 11126	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11127	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom read again: The beautiful woman.
 11128	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11129	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWarmth showered gently over him, cowing his flesh. Flesh yielded amply
 11130	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tamid rumpled clothes: whites of eyes swooning up. His nostrils arched
 11131	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthemselves for prey. Melting breast ointments (for him! For Raoul!).
 11132	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tArmpits’ oniony sweat. Fishgluey slime (her heaving embonpoint!). Feel!
 11133	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPress! Crished! Sulphur dung of lions!
 11134	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11135	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tYoung! Young!
 11136	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11137	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAn elderly female, no more young, left the building of the courts of
 11138	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchancery, king’s bench, exchequer and common pleas, having heard in
 11139	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe lord chancellor’s court the case in lunacy of Potterton, in the
 11140	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tadmiralty division the summons, exparte motion, of the owners of the
 11141	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLady Cairns versus the owners of the barque Mona, in the court of appeal
 11142	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\treservation of judgment in the case of Harvey versus the Ocean Accident
 11143	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand Guarantee Corporation.
 11144	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11145	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPhlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop, bulging out the dingy
 11146	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcurtains. The shopman’s uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven
 11147	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\treddened face, coughing. He raked his throat rudely, puked phlegm on the
 11148	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfloor. He put his boot on what he had spat, wiping his sole along it,
 11149	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand bent, showing a rawskinned crown, scantily haired.
 11150	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11151	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom beheld it.
 11152	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11153	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMastering his troubled breath, he said:
 11154	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11155	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I’ll take this one.
 11156	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11157	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum.
 11158	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11159	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Sweets of Sin, he said, tapping on it. That’s a good one.
 11160	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11161	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe lacquey by the door of Dillon’s auctionrooms shook his handbell
 11162	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttwice again and viewed himself in the chalked mirror of the cabinet.
 11163	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11164	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDilly Dedalus, loitering by the curbstone, heard the beats of the
 11165	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbell, the cries of the auctioneer within. Four and nine. Those lovely
 11166	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcurtains. Five shillings. Cosy curtains. Selling new at two guineas. Any
 11167	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tadvance on five shillings? Going for five shillings.
 11168	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11169	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe lacquey lifted his handbell and shook it:
 11170	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11171	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Barang!
 11172	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11173	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBang of the lastlap bell spurred the halfmile wheelmen to their sprint.
 11174	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJ. A. Jackson, W. E. Wylie, A. Munro and H. T. Gahan, their stretched
 11175	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnecks wagging, negotiated the curve by the College library.
 11176	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11177	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Dedalus, tugging a long moustache, came round from Williams’s row. He
 11178	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thalted near his daughter.
 11179	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11180	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—It’s time for you, she said.
 11181	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11182	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Stand up straight for the love of the lord Jesus, Mr Dedalus said.
 11183	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAre you trying to imitate your uncle John, the cornetplayer, head upon
 11184	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshoulder? Melancholy God!
 11185	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11186	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDilly shrugged her shoulders. Mr Dedalus placed his hands on them and
 11187	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\theld them back.
 11188	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11189	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Stand up straight, girl, he said. You’ll get curvature of the spine. Do
 11190	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou know what you look like?
 11191	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11192	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe let his head sink suddenly down and forward, hunching his shoulders
 11193	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand dropping his underjaw.
 11194	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11195	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Give it up, father, Dilly said. All the people are looking at you.
 11196	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11197	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache.
 11198	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11199	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Did you get any money? Dilly asked.
 11200	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11201	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Where would I get money? Mr Dedalus said. There is no-one in Dublin
 11202	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould lend me fourpence.
 11203	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11204	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You got some, Dilly said, looking in his eyes.
 11205	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11206	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—How do you know that? Mr Dedalus asked, his tongue in his cheek.
 11207	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11208	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked, walked boldly along
 11209	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJames’s street.
 11210	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11211	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I know you did, Dilly answered. Were you in the Scotch house now?
 11212	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11213	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I was not, then, Mr Dedalus said, smiling. Was it the little nuns
 11214	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttaught you to be so saucy? Here.
 11215	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11216	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe handed her a shilling.
 11217	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11218	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—See if you can do anything with that, he said.
 11219	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11220	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I suppose you got five, Dilly said. Give me more than that.
 11221	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11222	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Wait awhile, Mr Dedalus said threateningly. You’re like the rest of
 11223	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem, are you? An insolent pack of little bitches since your poor mother
 11224	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdied. But wait awhile. You’ll all get a short shrift and a long day from
 11225	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tme. Low blackguardism! I’m going to get rid of you. Wouldn’t care if I
 11226	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas stretched out stiff. He’s dead. The man upstairs is dead.
 11227	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11228	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe left her and walked on. Dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat.
 11229	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11230	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Well, what is it? he said, stopping.
 11231	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11232	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe lacquey rang his bell behind their backs.
 11233	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11234	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Barang!
 11235	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11236	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Curse your bloody blatant soul, Mr Dedalus cried, turning on him.
 11237	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11238	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe lacquey, aware of comment, shook the lolling clapper of his bell but
 11239	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfeebly:
 11240	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11241	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Bang!
 11242	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11243	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Dedalus stared at him.
 11244	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11245	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Watch him, he said. It’s instructive. I wonder will he allow us to
 11246	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttalk.
 11247	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11248	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You got more than that, father, Dilly said.
 11249	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11250	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I’m going to show you a little trick, Mr Dedalus said. I’ll leave
 11251	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou all where Jesus left the jews. Look, there’s all I have. I got
 11252	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttwo shillings from Jack Power and I spent twopence for a shave for the
 11253	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfuneral.
 11254	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11255	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe drew forth a handful of copper coins, nervously.
 11256	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11257	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Can’t you look for some money somewhere? Dilly said.
 11258	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11259	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Dedalus thought and nodded.
 11260	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11261	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I will, he said gravely. I looked all along the gutter in O’Connell
 11262	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstreet. I’ll try this one now.
 11263	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11264	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You’re very funny, Dilly said, grinning.
 11265	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11266	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Here, Mr Dedalus said, handing her two pennies. Get a glass of milk for
 11267	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyourself and a bun or a something. I’ll be home shortly.
 11268	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11269	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on.
 11270	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11271	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe viceregal cavalcade passed, greeted by obsequious policemen, out of
 11272	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tParkgate.
 11273	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11274	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I’m sure you have another shilling, Dilly said.
 11275	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11276	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe lacquey banged loudly.
 11277	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11278	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Dedalus amid the din walked off, murmuring to himself with a pursing
 11279	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmincing mouth gently:
 11280	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11281	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The little nuns! Nice little things! O, sure they wouldn’t do anything!
 11282	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tO, sure they wouldn’t really! Is it little sister Monica!
 11283	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11284	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFrom the sundial towards James’s gate walked Mr Kernan, pleased with the
 11285	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\torder he had booked for Pulbrook Robertson, boldly along James’s street,
 11286	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpast Shackleton’s offices. Got round him all right. How do you do, Mr
 11287	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCrimmins? First rate, sir. I was afraid you might be up in your other
 11288	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\testablishment in Pimlico. How are things going? Just keeping alive.
 11289	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLovely weather we’re having. Yes, indeed. Good for the country. Those
 11290	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfarmers are always grumbling. I’ll just take a thimbleful of your best
 11291	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgin, Mr Crimmins. A small gin, sir. Yes, sir. Terrible affair that
 11292	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGeneral Slocum explosion. Terrible, terrible! A thousand casualties. And
 11293	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\theartrending scenes. Men trampling down women and children. Most brutal
 11294	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthing. What do they say was the cause? Spontaneous combustion. Most
 11295	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tscandalous revelation. Not a single lifeboat would float and the
 11296	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfirehose all burst. What I can’t understand is how the inspectors ever
 11297	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tallowed a boat like that... Now, you’re talking straight, Mr Crimmins.
 11298	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tYou know why? Palm oil. Is that a fact? Without a doubt. Well now, look
 11299	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat that. And America they say is the land of the free. I thought we were
 11300	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbad here.
 11301	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11302	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI smiled at him. America, I said quietly, just like that. What is it?
 11303	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe sweepings of every country including our own. Isn’t that true?
 11304	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThat’s a fact.
 11305	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11306	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGraft, my dear sir. Well, of course, where there’s money going there’s
 11307	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\talways someone to pick it up.
 11308	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11309	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSaw him looking at my frockcoat. Dress does it. Nothing like a dressy
 11310	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tappearance. Bowls them over.
 11311	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11312	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said. How are things?
 11313	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11314	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.
 11315	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11316	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Kernan halted and preened himself before the sloping mirror of Peter
 11317	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKennedy, hairdresser. Stylish coat, beyond a doubt. Scott of Dawson
 11318	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstreet. Well worth the half sovereign I gave Neary for it. Never built
 11319	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunder three guineas. Fits me down to the ground. Some Kildare street
 11320	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tclub toff had it probably. John Mulligan, the manager of the Hibernian
 11321	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbank, gave me a very sharp eye yesterday on Carlisle bridge as if he
 11322	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tremembered me.
 11323	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11324	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAham! Must dress the character for those fellows. Knight of the road.
 11325	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGentleman. And now, Mr Crimmins, may we have the honour of your custom
 11326	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tagain, sir. The cup that cheers but not inebriates, as the old saying
 11327	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thas it.
 11328	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t

 11334	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGrizzled moustache. Returned Indian officer. Bravely he bore his stumpy
 11335	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbody forward on spatted feet, squaring his shoulders. Is that Ned
 11336	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLambert’s brother over the way, Sam? What? Yes. He’s as like it as damn
 11337	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit. No. The windscreen of that motorcar in the sun there. Just a flash
 11338	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlike that. Damn like him.
 11339	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11340	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAham! Hot spirit of juniper juice warmed his vitals and his breath. Good
 11341	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdrop of gin, that was. His frocktails winked in bright sunshine to his

 11351	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLet me see. Is he buried in saint Michan’s? Or no, there was a midnight
 11352	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tburial in Glasnevin. Corpse brought in through a secret door in the

 11355	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11356	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Kernan turned and walked down the slope of Watling street by

 11368	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTimes of the troubles. Must ask Ned Lambert to lend me those

 11371	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcardsharping then. One of those fellows got his hand nailed to the table
 11372	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby a dagger. Somewhere here lord Edward Fitzgerald escaped from major

 11421	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe whirr of flapping leathern bands and hum of dynamos from the
 11422	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpowerhouse urged Stephen to be on. Beingless beings. Stop! Throb always
 11423	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twithout you and the throb always within. Your heart you sing of. I

 11425	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShatter them, one and both. But stun myself too in the blow. Shatter me

 11429	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tYes, quite true. Very large and wonderful and keeps famous time. You say

 11432	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen went down Bedford row, the handle of the ash clacking against

 11439	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe turned and halted by the slanted bookcart.

 11478	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What have you there? Stephen asked.
 11479	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11480	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I bought it from the other cart for a penny, Dilly said, laughing
 11481	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnervously. Is it any good?
 11482	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11483	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMy eyes they say she has. Do others see me so? Quick, far and daring.

 11486	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe took the coverless book from her hand. Chardenal’s French primer.
 11487	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11488	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What did you buy that for? he asked. To learn French?
 11489	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11490	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe nodded, reddening and closing tight her lips.
 11491	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11492	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShow no surprise. Quite natural.
 11493	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t

 11509	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said. How are things?
 11510	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11511	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.
 11512	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11513	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey clasped hands loudly outside Reddy and Daughter’s. Father Cowley
 11514	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand.
 11515	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11516	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What’s the best news? Mr Dedalus said.
 11517	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11518	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Why then not much, Father Cowley said. I’m barricaded up, Simon, with
 11519	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttwo men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance.
 11520	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11521	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Jolly, Mr Dedalus said. Who is it?
 11522	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11523	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O, Father Cowley said. A certain gombeen man of our acquaintance.
 11524	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11525	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—With a broken back, is it? Mr Dedalus asked.
 11526	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11527	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The same, Simon, Father Cowley answered. Reuben of that ilk. I’m just
 11528	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twaiting for Ben Dollard. He’s going to say a word to long John to get
 11529	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim to take those two men off. All I want is a little time.
 11530	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11531	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe looked with vague hope up and down the quay, a big apple bulging in
 11532	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this neck.
 11533	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11534	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I know, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. Poor old bockedy Ben! He’s always
 11535	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdoing a good turn for someone. Hold hard!
 11536	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11537	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant.
 11538	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11539	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—There he is, by God, he said, arse and pockets.
 11540	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11541	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBen Dollard’s loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops
 11542	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcrossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge. He came towards
 11543	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem at an amble, scratching actively behind his coattails.
 11544	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11545	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAs he came near Mr Dedalus greeted:
 11546	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11547	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Hold that fellow with the bad trousers.
 11548	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11549	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Hold him now, Ben Dollard said.
 11550	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11551	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of Ben
 11552	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDollard’s figure. Then, turning to Father Cowley with a nod, he muttered
 11553	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsneeringly:
 11554	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11555	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That’s a pretty garment, isn’t it, for a summer’s day?
 11556	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11557	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Why, God eternally curse your soul, Ben Dollard growled furiously, I
 11558	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthrew out more clothes in my time than you ever saw.
 11559	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11560	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe stood beside them beaming, on them first and on his roomy clothes
 11561	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff, saying:
 11562	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11563	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—They were made for a man in his health, Ben, anyhow.
 11564	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11565	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Bad luck to the jewman that made them, Ben Dollard said. Thanks be to
 11566	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGod he’s not paid yet.
 11567	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11568	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And how is that basso profondo, Benjamin? Father Cowley asked.
 11569	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11570	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, murmuring,
 11571	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglassyeyed, strode past the Kildare street club.
 11572	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11573	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBen Dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanter’s mouth, gave forth a
 11574	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdeep note.
 11575	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11576	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Aw! he said.
 11577	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11578	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That’s the style, Mr Dedalus said, nodding to its drone.
 11579	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11580	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What about that? Ben Dollard said. Not too dusty? What?
 11581	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11582	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe turned to both.
 11583	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11584	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That’ll do, Father Cowley said, nodding also.
 11585	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11586	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe reverend Hugh C. Love walked from the old chapterhouse of saint
 11587	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMary’s abbey past James and Charles Kennedy’s, rectifiers, attended by
 11588	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGeraldines tall and personable, towards the Tholsel beyond the ford of
 11589	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thurdles.
 11590	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11591	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBen Dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward,
 11592	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this joyful fingers in the air.
 11593	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11594	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Come along with me to the subsheriff’s office, he said. I want to
 11595	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshow you the new beauty Rock has for a bailiff. He’s a cross between
 11596	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLobengula and Lynchehaun. He’s well worth seeing, mind you. Come along.
 11597	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI saw John Henry Menton casually in the Bodega just now and it will
 11598	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcost me a fall if I don’t... Wait awhile... We’re on the right lay, Bob,
 11599	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbelieve you me.
 11600	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11601	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—For a few days tell him, Father Cowley said anxiously.
 11602	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11603	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBen Dollard halted and stared, his loud orifice open, a dangling button
 11604	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the
 11605	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\theavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright.
 11606	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11607	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What few days? he boomed. Hasn’t your landlord distrained for rent?
 11608	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11609	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—He has, Father Cowley said.
 11610	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11611	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Then our friend’s writ is not worth the paper it’s printed on, Ben
 11612	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDollard said. The landlord has the prior claim. I gave him all the
 11613	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tparticulars. 29 Windsor avenue. Love is the name?
 11614	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11615	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That’s right, Father Cowley said. The reverend Mr Love. He’s a minister
 11616	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the country somewhere. But are you sure of that?
 11617	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11618	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You can tell Barabbas from me, Ben Dollard said, that he can put that
 11619	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twrit where Jacko put the nuts.

 11622	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11623	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Filberts I believe they were, Mr Dedalus said, as he dropped his
 11624	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglasses on his coatfront, following them.
 11625	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11626	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The youngster will be all right, Martin Cunningham said, as they passed
 11627	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout of the Castleyard gate.
 11628	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11629	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe policeman touched his forehead.
 11630	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11631	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—God bless you, Martin Cunningham said, cheerily.
 11632	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11633	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on
 11634	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttowards Lord Edward street.
 11635	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11636	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBronze by gold, Miss Kennedy’s head by Miss Douce’s head, appeared above
 11637	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe crossblind of the Ormond hotel.
 11638	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11639	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, Martin Cunningham said, fingering his beard. I wrote to Father
 11640	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tConmee and laid the whole case before him.
 11641	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11642	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You could try our friend, Mr Power suggested backward.
 11643	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11644	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Boyd? Martin Cunningham said shortly. Touch me not.
 11645	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11646	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJohn Wyse Nolan, lagging behind, reading the list, came after them
 11647	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tquickly down Cork hill.
 11648	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11649	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOn the steps of the City hall Councillor Nannetti, descending, hailed
 11650	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAlderman Cowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending.
 11651	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11652	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe castle car wheeled empty into upper Exchange street.
 11653	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11654	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Look here, Martin, John Wyse Nolan said, overtaking them at the Mail
 11655	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\toffice. I see Bloom put his name down for five shillings.
 11656	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11657	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Quite right, Martin Cunningham said, taking the list. And put down the
 11658	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfive shillings too.
 11659	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11660	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Without a second word either, Mr Power said.
 11661	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11662	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Strange but true, Martin Cunningham added.
 11663	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11664	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJohn Wyse Nolan opened wide eyes.
 11665	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11666	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I’ll say there is much kindness in the jew, he quoted, elegantly.
 11667	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11668	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey went down Parliament street.
 11669	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11670	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—There’s Jimmy Henry, Mr Power said, just heading for Kavanagh’s.
 11671	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11672	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Righto, Martin Cunningham said. Here goes.
 11673	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11674	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOutside la Maison Claire Blazes Boylan waylaid Jack Mooney’s
 11675	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrother-in-law, humpy, tight, making for the liberties.
 11676	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11677	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJohn Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power, while Martin Cunningham took
 11678	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit, who walked
 11679	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tuncertainly, with hasty steps past Micky Anderson’s watches.
 11680	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11681	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The assistant town clerk’s corns are giving him some trouble, John Wyse
 11682	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNolan told Mr Power.
 11683	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11684	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey followed round the corner towards James Kavanagh’s winerooms. The
 11685	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tempty castle car fronted them at rest in Essex gate. Martin Cunningham,
 11686	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspeaking always, showed often the list at which Jimmy Henry did not
 11687	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglance.
 11688	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11689	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And long John Fanning is here too, John Wyse Nolan said, as large as
 11690	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlife.
 11691	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11692	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe tall form of long John Fanning filled the doorway where he stood.
 11693	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11694	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Good day, Mr Subsheriff, Martin Cunningham said, as all halted and
 11695	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgreeted.
 11696	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11697	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLong John Fanning made no way for them. He removed his large Henry Clay
 11698	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdecisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all
 11699	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir faces.
 11700	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11701	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations? he
 11702	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaid with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk.
 11703	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11704	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHell open to christians they were having, Jimmy Henry said pettishly,
 11705	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabout their damned Irish language. Where was the marshal, he wanted
 11706	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto know, to keep order in the council chamber. And old Barlow the
 11707	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmacebearer laid up with asthma, no mace on the table, nothing in order,
 11708	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tno quorum even, and Hutchinson, the lord mayor, in Llandudno and little
 11709	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLorcan Sherlock doing locum tenens for him. Damned Irish language,
 11710	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlanguage of our forefathers.
 11711	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11712	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLong John Fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips.
 11713	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11714	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMartin Cunningham spoke by turns, twirling the peak of his beard, to the
 11715	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tassistant town clerk and the subsheriff, while John Wyse Nolan held his
 11716	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpeace.
 11717	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11718	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What Dignam was that? long John Fanning asked.
 11719	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11720	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJimmy Henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot.
 11721	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11722	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O, my corns! he said plaintively. Come upstairs for goodness’ sake till
 11723	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI sit down somewhere. Uff! Ooo! Mind!
 11724	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11725	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTestily he made room for himself beside long John Fanning’s flank and
 11726	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpassed in and up the stairs.
 11727	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11728	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Come on up, Martin Cunningham said to the subsheriff. I don’t think you
 11729	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknew him or perhaps you did, though.
 11730	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11731	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWith John Wyse Nolan Mr Power followed them in.
 11732	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11733	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Decent little soul he was, Mr Power said to the stalwart back of long
 11734	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJohn Fanning ascending towards long John Fanning in the mirror.
 11735	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11736	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Rather lowsized. Dignam of Menton’s office that was, Martin Cunningham
 11737	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaid.
 11738	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11739	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLong John Fanning could not remember him.
 11740	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11741	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tClatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air.
 11742	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11743	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What’s that? Martin Cunningham said.
 11744	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11745	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAll turned where they stood. John Wyse Nolan came down again. From the
 11746	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliament street,
 11747	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tharness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering. Gaily they went past
 11748	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbefore his cool unfriendly eyes, not quickly. In saddles of the leaders,
 11749	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tleaping leaders, rode outriders.
 11750	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11751	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What was it? Martin Cunningham asked, as they went on up the staircase.
 11752	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11753	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland, John Wyse
 11754	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNolan answered from the stairfoot.
 11755	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11756	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAs they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behind his
 11757	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPanama to Haines:
 11758	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11759	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Parnell’s brother. There in the corner.
 11760	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11761	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey chose a small table near the window, opposite a longfaced man whose
 11762	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard.
 11763	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11764	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Is that he? Haines asked, twisting round in his seat.
 11765	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11766	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, Mulligan said. That’s John Howard, his brother, our city marshal.
 11767	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11768	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJohn Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw
 11769	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twent up again to his forehead whereat it rested. An instant after, under
 11770	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tits screen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbright, at his foe and fell
 11771	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tonce more upon a working corner.
 11772	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11773	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I’ll take a mélange, Haines said to the waitress.
 11774	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11775	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Two mélanges, Buck Mulligan said. And bring us some scones and butter
 11776	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand some cakes as well.
 11777	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11778	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhen she had gone he said, laughing:
 11779	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11780	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—We call it D.B.C. because they have damn bad cakes. O, but you missed
 11781	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDedalus on Hamlet.
 11782	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11783	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHaines opened his newbought book.
 11784	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11785	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I’m sorry, he said. Shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all minds
 11786	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat have lost their balance.
 11787	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11788	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe onelegged sailor growled at the area of 14 Nelson street:
 11789	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11790	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—England expects...
 11791	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11792	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBuck Mulligan’s primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter.
 11793	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11794	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You should see him, he said, when his body loses its balance. Wandering
 11795	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tÆngus I call him.
 11796	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11797	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I am sure he has an idée fixe, Haines said, pinching his chin
 11798	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthoughtfully with thumb and forefinger. Now I am speculating what it
 11799	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould be likely to be. Such persons always have.
 11800	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11801	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBuck Mulligan bent across the table gravely.
 11802	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11803	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—They drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell. He will never
 11804	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcapture the Attic note. The note of Swinburne, of all poets, the white
 11805	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdeath and the ruddy birth. That is his tragedy. He can never be a poet.
 11806	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe joy of creation...
 11807	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11808	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Eternal punishment, Haines said, nodding curtly. I see. I tackled him
 11809	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthis morning on belief. There was something on his mind, I saw.
 11810	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIt’s rather interesting because professor Pokorny of Vienna makes an
 11811	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinteresting point out of that.
 11812	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11813	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBuck Mulligan’s watchful eyes saw the waitress come. He helped her to
 11814	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunload her tray.
 11815	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11816	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—He can find no trace of hell in ancient Irish myth, Haines said, amid
 11817	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe cheerful cups. The moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny,
 11818	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof retribution. Rather strange he should have just that fixed idea. Does
 11819	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the write anything for your movement?
 11820	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11821	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream.
 11822	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBuck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over its
 11823	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsmoking pith. He bit off a soft piece hungrily.
 11824	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11825	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ten years, he said, chewing and laughing. He is going to write
 11826	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsomething in ten years.
 11827	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11828	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Seems a long way off, Haines said, thoughtfully lifting his spoon.
 11829	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStill, I shouldn’t wonder if he did after all.
 11830	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11831	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup.
 11832	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11833	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—This is real Irish cream I take it, he said with forbearance. I don’t
 11834	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twant to be imposed on.
 11835	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11836	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tElijah, skiff, light crumpled throwaway, sailed eastward by flanks of
 11837	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tships and trawlers, amid an archipelago of corks, beyond new Wapping
 11838	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstreet past Benson’s ferry, and by the threemasted schooner Rosevean
 11839	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom Bridgwater with bricks.
 11840	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11841	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAlmidano Artifoni walked past Holles street, past Sewell’s yard.
 11842	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBehind him Cashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, with
 11843	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstickumbrelladustcoat dangling, shunned the lamp before Mr Law Smith’s
 11844	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thouse and, crossing, walked along Merrion square. Distantly behind him a
 11845	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblind stripling tapped his way by the wall of College park.
 11846	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11847	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCashel Boyle O’Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walked as far as
 11848	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Lewis Werner’s cheerful windows, then turned and strode back along
 11849	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMerrion square, his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling.
 11850	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11851	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAt the corner of Wilde’s house he halted, frowned at Elijah’s name
 11852	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tannounced on the Metropolitan hall, frowned at the distant pleasance of
 11853	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tduke’s lawn. His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun. With ratsteeth
 11854	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbared he muttered:
 11855	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11856	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Coactus volui.
 11857	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11858	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe strode on for Clare street, grinding his fierce word.
 11859	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11860	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAs he strode past Mr Bloom’s dental windows the sway of his dustcoat
 11861	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards,
 11862	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thaving buffeted a thewless body. The blind stripling turned his sickly
 11863	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tface after the striding form.
 11864	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11865	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—God’s curse on you, he said sourly, whoever you are! You’re blinder nor
 11866	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI am, you bitch’s bastard!
 11867	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11868	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOpposite Ruggy O’Donohoe’s Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, pawing the
 11869	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpound and a half of Mangan’s, late Fehrenbach’s, porksteaks he had been
 11870	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsent for, went along warm Wicklow street dawdling. It was too blooming
 11871	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley and Mrs
 11872	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMacDowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping
 11873	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought from Tunney’s.
 11874	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake, jawing the whole
 11875	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblooming time and sighing.
 11876	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11877	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAfter Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle, courtdress milliner,
 11878	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstopped him. He stood looking in at the two puckers stripped to their
 11879	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpelts and putting up their props. From the sidemirrors two mourning
 11880	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMasters Dignam gaped silently. Myler Keogh, Dublin’s pet lamb, will
 11881	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmeet sergeantmajor Bennett, the Portobello bruiser, for a purse of fifty
 11882	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsovereigns. Gob, that’d be a good pucking match to see. Myler Keogh,
 11883	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat’s the chap sparring out to him with the green sash. Two bar
 11884	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tentrance, soldiers half price. I could easy do a bunk on ma. Master
 11885	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDignam on his left turned as he turned. That’s me in mourning. When
 11886	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tis it? May the twentysecond. Sure, the blooming thing is all over. He
 11887	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tturned to the right and on his right Master Dignam turned, his cap awry,
 11888	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this collar sticking up. Buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he saw the
 11889	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\timage of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, beside the two puckers. One
 11890	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof them mots that do be in the packets of fags Stoer smokes that his old
 11891	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfellow welted hell out of him for one time he found out.
 11892	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11893	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMaster Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on. The best pucker going
 11894	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor strength was Fitzsimons. One puck in the wind from that fellow would
 11895	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknock you into the middle of next week, man. But the best pucker for
 11896	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tscience was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out of
 11897	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim, dodging and all.
 11898	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11899	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIn Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toff’s mouth and
 11900	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was
 11901	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttelling him and grinning all the time.
 11902	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11903	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNo Sandymount tram.
 11904	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 11905	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMaster Dignam walked along Nassau street, shifted the porksteaks to
 11906	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this other hand. His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down. The
 11907	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt, blooming
 11908	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tend to it. He met schoolboys with satchels. I’m not going tomorrow
 11909	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\teither, stay away till Monday. He met other schoolboys. Do they notice
 11910	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI’m in mourning? Uncle Barney said he’d get it into the paper tonight.
 11911	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThen they’ll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pa’s
 11912	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tname.

 11919	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle Barney telling
 11920	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe men how to get it round the bend. A big coffin it was, and high and
 11921	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\theavylooking. How was that? The last night pa was boosed he was standing

 12204	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe laughed:
 12205	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12206	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O wept! Aren’t men frightful idiots?
 12207	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12208	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWith sadness.
 12209	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12210	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMiss Kennedy sauntered sadly from bright light, twining a loose hair
 12211	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbehind an ear. Sauntering sadly, gold no more, she twisted twined a
 12212	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thair. Sadly she twined in sauntering gold hair behind a curving ear.
 12213	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12214	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—It’s them has the fine times, sadly then she said.
 12215	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12216	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA man.
 12217	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12218	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBloowho went by by Moulang’s pipes bearing in his breast the sweets
 12219	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof sin, by Wine’s antiques, in memory bearing sweet sinful words, by
 12220	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCarroll’s dusky battered plate, for Raoul.
 12221	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12222	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe boots to them, them in the bar, them barmaids came. For them
 12223	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunheeding him he banged on the counter his tray of chattering china. And
 12224	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12225	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—There’s your teas, he said.
 12226	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12227	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMiss Kennedy with manners transposed the teatray down to an upturned
 12228	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlithia crate, safe from eyes, low.
 12229	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12230	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What is it? loud boots unmannerly asked.
 12231	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12232	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Find out, miss Douce retorted, leaving her spyingpoint.
 12233	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12234	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Your beau, is it?
 12235	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12236	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA haughty bronze replied:
 12237	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12238	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I’ll complain to Mrs de Massey on you if I hear any more of your
 12239	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\timpertinent insolence.
 12240	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12241	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Imperthnthn thnthnthn, bootssnout sniffed rudely, as he retreated as
 12242	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe threatened as he had come.
 12243	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12244	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBloom.
 12245	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12246	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOn her flower frowning miss Douce said:
 12247	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12248	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Most aggravating that young brat is. If he doesn’t conduct himself I’ll
 12249	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twring his ear for him a yard long.
 12250	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12251	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLadylike in exquisite contrast.
 12252	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12253	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Take no notice, miss Kennedy rejoined.
 12254	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12255	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe poured in a teacup tea, then back in the teapot tea. They cowered
 12256	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunder their reef of counter, waiting on footstools, crates upturned,
 12257	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twaiting for their teas to draw. They pawed their blouses, both of black
 12258	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsatin, two and nine a yard, waiting for their teas to draw, and two and
 12259	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseven.
 12260	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12261	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tYes, bronze from anear, by gold from afar, heard steel from anear, hoofs
 12262	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tring from afar, and heard steelhoofs ringhoof ringsteel.
 12263	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12264	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Am I awfully sunburnt?
 12265	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12266	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMiss bronze unbloused her neck.
 12267	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12268	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—No, said miss Kennedy. It gets brown after. Did you try the borax with
 12269	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe cherry laurel water?
 12270	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12271	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMiss Douce halfstood to see her skin askance in the barmirror
 12272	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgildedlettered where hock and claret glasses shimmered and in their
 12273	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmidst a shell.
 12274	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12275	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And leave it to my hands, she said.
 12276	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12277	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Try it with the glycerine, miss Kennedy advised.
 12278	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12279	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBidding her neck and hands adieu miss Douce
 12280	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12281	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Those things only bring out a rash, replied, reseated. I asked that old
 12282	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfogey in Boyd’s for something for my skin.
 12283	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12284	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMiss Kennedy, pouring now a fulldrawn tea, grimaced and prayed:
 12285	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12286	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O, don’t remind me of him for mercy’ sake!
 12287	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12288	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—But wait till I tell you, miss Douce entreated.
 12289	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12290	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSweet tea miss Kennedy having poured with milk plugged both two ears
 12291	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith little fingers.
 12292	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12293	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—No, don’t, she cried.
 12294	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12295	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I won’t listen, she cried.
 12296	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12297	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut Bloom?
 12298	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12299	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMiss Douce grunted in snuffy fogey’s tone:
 12300	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12301	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—For your what? says he.
 12302	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12303	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMiss Kennedy unplugged her ears to hear, to speak: but said, but prayed
 12304	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tagain:
 12305	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12306	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Don’t let me think of him or I’ll expire. The hideous old wretch! That
 12307	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnight in the Antient Concert Rooms.
 12308	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12309	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe sipped distastefully her brew, hot tea, a sip, sipped, sweet tea.
 12310	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12311	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Here he was, miss Douce said, cocking her bronze head three quarters,
 12312	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\truffling her nosewings. Hufa! Hufa!
 12313	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12314	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShrill shriek of laughter sprang from miss Kennedy’s throat. Miss Douce
 12315	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thuffed and snorted down her nostrils that quivered imperthnthn like a
 12316	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsnout in quest.
 12317	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12318	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O! shrieking, miss Kennedy cried. Will you ever forget his goggle eye?
 12319	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12320	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMiss Douce chimed in in deep bronze laughter, shouting:
 12321	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12322	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And your other eye!
 12323	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12324	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBloowhose dark eye read Aaron Figatner’s name. Why do I always think
 12325	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFigather? Gathering figs, I think. And Prosper Loré’s huguenot name.
 12326	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBy Bassi’s blessed virgins Bloom’s dark eyes went by. Bluerobed, white
 12327	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunder, come to me. God they believe she is: or goddess. Those today. I
 12328	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcould not see. That fellow spoke. A student. After with Dedalus’ son.
 12329	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe might be Mulligan. All comely virgins. That brings those rakes of
 12330	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfellows in: her white.
 12331	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12332	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBy went his eyes. The sweets of sin. Sweet are the sweets.
 12333	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12334	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOf sin.
 12335	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12336	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIn a giggling peal young goldbronze voices blended, Douce with Kennedy
 12337	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyour other eye. They threw young heads back, bronze gigglegold, to let
 12338	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfreefly their laughter, screaming, your other, signals to each other,
 12339	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thigh piercing notes.
 12340	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12341	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAh, panting, sighing, sighing, ah, fordone, their mirth died down.
 12342	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12343	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMiss Kennedy lipped her cup again, raised, drank a sip and
 12344	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgigglegiggled. Miss Douce, bending over the teatray, ruffled again her
 12345	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnose and rolled droll fattened eyes. Again Kennygiggles, stooping,
 12346	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther fair pinnacles of hair, stooping, her tortoise napecomb showed,
 12347	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspluttered out of her mouth her tea, choking in tea and laughter,
 12348	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcoughing with choking, crying:
 12349	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12350	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O greasy eyes! Imagine being married to a man like that! she cried.
 12351	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWith his bit of beard!
 12352	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12353	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDouce gave full vent to a splendid yell, a full yell of full woman,
 12354	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdelight, joy, indignation.
 12355	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12356	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Married to the greasy nose! she yelled.
 12357	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12358	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShrill, with deep laughter, after, gold after bronze, they urged each
 12359	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\teach to peal after peal, ringing in changes, bronzegold, goldbronze,
 12360	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshrilldeep, to laughter after laughter. And then laughed more. Greasy I
 12361	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknows. Exhausted, breathless, their shaken heads they laid, braided and
 12362	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpinnacled by glossycombed, against the counterledge. All flushed (O!),
 12363	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpanting, sweating (O!), all breathless.
 12364	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12365	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMarried to Bloom, to greaseabloom.
 12366	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12367	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O saints above! miss Douce said, sighed above her jumping rose. I
 12368	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twished I hadn’t laughed so much. I feel all wet.
 12369	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12370	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O, miss Douce! miss Kennedy protested. You horrid thing!
 12371	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12372	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd flushed yet more (you horrid!), more goldenly.
 12373	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12374	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBy Cantwell’s offices roved Greaseabloom, by Ceppi’s virgins, bright of
 12375	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir oils. Nannetti’s father hawked those things about, wheedling at
 12376	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdoors as I. Religion pays. Must see him for that par. Eat first. I want.
 12377	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNot yet. At four, she said. Time ever passing. Clockhands turning. On.
 12378	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhere eat? The Clarence, Dolphin. On. For Raoul. Eat. If I net five
 12379	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tguineas with those ads. The violet silk petticoats. Not yet. The sweets
 12380	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof sin.
 12381	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12382	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFlushed less, still less, goldenly paled.
 12383	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12384	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tInto their bar strolled Mr Dedalus. Chips, picking chips off one of his
 12385	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trocky thumbnails. Chips. He strolled.
 12386	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12387	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O, welcome back, miss Douce.
 12388	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12389	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe held her hand. Enjoyed her holidays?
 12390	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12391	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Tiptop.
 12392	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12393	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe hoped she had nice weather in Rostrevor.
 12394	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12395	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Gorgeous, she said. Look at the holy show I am. Lying out on the strand
 12396	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall day.
 12397	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12398	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBronze whiteness.
 12399	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12400	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That was exceedingly naughty of you, Mr Dedalus told her and pressed
 12401	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther hand indulgently. Tempting poor simple males.
 12402	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12403	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMiss Douce of satin douced her arm away.
 12404	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12405	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O go away! she said. You’re very simple, I don’t think.
 12406	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12407	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe was.
 12408	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12409	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Well now I am, he mused. I looked so simple in the cradle they
 12410	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchristened me simple Simon.
 12411	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12412	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You must have been a doaty, miss Douce made answer. And what did the
 12413	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdoctor order today?
 12414	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12415	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Well now, he mused, whatever you say yourself. I think I’ll trouble you
 12416	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor some fresh water and a half glass of whisky.
 12417	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12418	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJingle.
 12419	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12420	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—With the greatest alacrity, miss Douce agreed.
 12421	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12422	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWith grace of alacrity towards the mirror gilt Cantrell and Cochrane’s
 12423	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe turned herself. With grace she tapped a measure of gold whisky from
 12424	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther crystal keg. Forth from the skirt of his coat Mr Dedalus brought
 12425	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpouch and pipe. Alacrity she served. He blew through the flue two husky
 12426	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfifenotes.
 12427	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12428	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—By Jove, he mused, I often wanted to see the Mourne mountains. Must
 12429	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbe a great tonic in the air down there. But a long threatening comes at
 12430	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlast, they say. Yes. Yes.
 12431	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12432	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tYes. He fingered shreds of hair, her maidenhair, her mermaid’s, into the
 12433	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbowl. Chips. Shreds. Musing. Mute.
 12434	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12435	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNone nought said nothing. Yes.
 12436	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12437	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGaily miss Douce polished a tumbler, trilling:
 12438	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12439	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O, Idolores, queen of the eastern seas!
 12440	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12441	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Was Mr Lidwell in today?
 12442	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12443	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIn came Lenehan. Round him peered Lenehan. Mr Bloom reached Essex
 12444	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbridge. Yes, Mr Bloom crossed bridge of Yessex. To Martha I must write.
 12445	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBuy paper. Daly’s. Girl there civil. Bloom. Old Bloom. Blue bloom is on
 12446	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe rye.
 12447	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12448	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—He was in at lunchtime, miss Douce said.
 12449	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12450	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLenehan came forward.
 12451	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12452	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Was Mr Boylan looking for me?
 12453	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12454	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe asked. She answered:
 12455	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12456	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Miss Kennedy, was Mr Boylan in while I was upstairs?
 12457	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12458	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe asked. Miss voice of Kennedy answered, a second teacup poised, her
 12459	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgaze upon a page:
 12460	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12461	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—No. He was not.
 12462	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12463	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMiss gaze of Kennedy, heard, not seen, read on. Lenehan round the
 12464	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsandwichbell wound his round body round.
 12465	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12466	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Peep! Who’s in the corner?
 12467	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12468	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNo glance of Kennedy rewarding him he yet made overtures. To mind her
 12469	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstops. To read only the black ones: round o and crooked ess.
 12470	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12471	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJingle jaunty jingle.
 12472	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12473	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGirlgold she read and did not glance. Take no notice. She took no notice
 12474	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhile he read by rote a solfa fable for her, plappering flatly:
 12475	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12476	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ah fox met ah stork. Said thee fox too thee stork: Will you put your
 12477	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbill down inn my troath and pull upp ah bone?
 12478	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12479	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe droned in vain. Miss Douce turned to her tea aside.
 12480	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12481	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe sighed aside:
 12482	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12483	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ah me! O my!
 12484	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12485	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe greeted Mr Dedalus and got a nod.
 12486	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12487	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Greetings from the famous son of a famous father.
 12488	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12489	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Who may he be? Mr Dedalus asked.
 12490	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12491	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLenehan opened most genial arms. Who?
 12492	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12493	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Who may he be? he asked. Can you ask? Stephen, the youthful bard.
 12494	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12495	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDry.
 12496	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12497	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Dedalus, famous father, laid by his dry filled pipe.
 12498	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12499	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I see, he said. I didn’t recognise him for the moment. I hear he is
 12500	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tkeeping very select company. Have you seen him lately?
 12501	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12502	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe had.
 12503	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12504	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I quaffed the nectarbowl with him this very day, said Lenehan. In
 12505	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMooney’s en ville and in Mooney’s sur mer. He had received the rhino for
 12506	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe labour of his muse.
 12507	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12508	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe smiled at bronze’s teabathed lips, at listening lips and eyes:
 12509	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12510	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The élite of Erin hung upon his lips. The ponderous pundit, Hugh
 12511	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMacHugh, Dublin’s most brilliant scribe and editor and that minstrel boy
 12512	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the wild wet west who is known by the euphonious appellation of the
 12513	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tO’Madden Burke.
 12514	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12515	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAfter an interval Mr Dedalus raised his grog and
 12516	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12517	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That must have been highly diverting, said he. I see.
 12518	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12519	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe see. He drank. With faraway mourning mountain eye. Set down his
 12520	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglass.
 12521	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12522	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe looked towards the saloon door.
 12523	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12524	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I see you have moved the piano.
 12525	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12526	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The tuner was in today, miss Douce replied, tuning it for the smoking
 12527	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconcert and I never heard such an exquisite player.
 12528	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12529	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Is that a fact?
 12530	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12531	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Didn’t he, miss Kennedy? The real classical, you know. And blind too,
 12532	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpoor fellow. Not twenty I’m sure he was.
 12533	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12534	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Is that a fact? Mr Dedalus said.
 12535	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12536	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe drank and strayed away.
 12537	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12538	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—So sad to look at his face, miss Douce condoled.
 12539	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12540	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGod’s curse on bitch’s bastard.
 12541	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t

 12544	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLager for diner. Lager without alacrity she served.
 12545	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12546	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWith patience Lenehan waited for Boylan with impatience, for

 12549	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tUpholding the lid he (who?) gazed in the coffin (coffin?) at the oblique
 12550	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttriple (piano!) wires. He pressed (the same who pressed indulgently her
 12551	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thand), soft pedalling, a triple of keys to see the thicknesses of felt
 12552	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tadvancing, to hear the muffled hammerfall in action.

 12554	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTwo sheets cream vellum paper one reserve two envelopes when I was in

 12558	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRespectable girl meet after mass. Thanks awfully muchly. Wise Bloom eyed
 12559	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton the door a poster, a swaying mermaid smoking mid nice waves. Smoke
 12560	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmermaids, coolest whiff of all. Hair streaming: lovelorn. For some man.
 12561	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFor Raoul. He eyed and saw afar on Essex bridge a gay hat riding on a
 12562	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjaunting car. It is. Again. Third time. Coincidence.

 12566	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12567	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Twopence, sir, the shopgirl dared to say.
 12568	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12569	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Aha... I was forgetting... Excuse...
 12570	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12571	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And four.
 12572	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12573	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAt four she. Winsomely she on Bloohimwhom smiled. Bloo smi qui go.

 12575	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t

 12577	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t

 12579	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12580	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFrom the saloon a call came, long in dying. That was a tuningfork the
 12581	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttuner had that he forgot that he now struck. A call again. That he now
 12582	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpoised that it now throbbed. You hear? It throbbed, pure, purer, softly
 12583	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand softlier, its buzzing prongs. Longer in dying call.
 12584	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12585	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPat paid for diner’s popcorked bottle: and over tumbler, tray and

 12591	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA voiceless song sang from within, singing:
 12592	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t

 12594	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12595	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA duodene of birdnotes chirruped bright treble answer under sensitive
 12596	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thands. Brightly the keys, all twinkling, linked, all harpsichording,
 12597	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcalled to a voice to sing the strain of dewy morn, of youth, of love’s
 12598	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tleavetaking, life’s, love’s morn.
 12599	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12600	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The dewdrops pearl...
 12601	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12602	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLenehan’s lips over the counter lisped a low whistle of decoy.
 12603	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12604	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—But look this way, he said, rose of Castile.
 12605	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12606	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJingle jaunted by the curb and stopped.
 12607	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t

 12609	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdreamily rose.
 12610	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12611	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Did she fall or was she pushed? he asked her.
 12612	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12613	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe answered, slighting:
 12614	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12615	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ask no questions and you’ll hear no lies.
 12616	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12617	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLike lady, ladylike.
 12618	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12619	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBlazes Boylan’s smart tan shoes creaked on the barfloor where he strode.
 12620	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tYes, gold from anear by bronze from afar. Lenehan heard and knew and
 12621	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thailed him:
 12622	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12623	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—See the conquering hero comes.
 12624	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12625	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBetween the car and window, warily walking, went Bloom, unconquered
 12626	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thero. See me he might. The seat he sat on: warm. Black wary hecat walked
 12627	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttowards Richie Goulding’s legal bag, lifted aloft, saluting.
 12628	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12629	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And I from thee...
 12630	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12631	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I heard you were round, said Blazes Boylan.
 12632	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12633	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe touched to fair miss Kennedy a rim of his slanted straw. She smiled
 12634	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton him. But sister bronze outsmiled her, preening for him her richer
 12635	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thair, a bosom and a rose.
 12636	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12637	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSmart Boylan bespoke potions.
 12638	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12639	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What’s your cry? Glass of bitter? Glass of bitter, please, and a
 12640	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsloegin for me. Wire in yet?
 12641	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12642	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNot yet. At four she. Who said four?
 12643	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12644	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCowley’s red lugs and bulging apple in the door of the sheriff’s office.
 12645	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12646	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAvoid. Goulding a chance. What is he doing in the Ormond? Car waiting.
 12647	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWait.
 12648	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12649	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHello. Where off to? Something to eat? I too was just. In here. What,
 12650	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOrmond? Best value in Dublin. Is that so? Diningroom. Sit tight there.
 12651	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSee, not be seen. I think I’ll join you. Come on. Richie led on. Bloom
 12652	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfollowed bag. Dinner fit for a prince.
 12653	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12654	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMiss Douce reached high to take a flagon, stretching her satin arm, her
 12655	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbust, that all but burst, so high.
 12656	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12657	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O! O! jerked Lenehan, gasping at each stretch. O!
 12658	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12659	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut easily she seized her prey and led it low in triumph.
 12660	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12661	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Why don’t you grow? asked Blazes Boylan.
 12662	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12663	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShebronze, dealing from her oblique jar thick syrupy liquor for his
 12664	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlips, looked as it flowed (flower in his coat: who gave him?), and
 12665	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsyrupped with her voice:
 12666	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12667	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Fine goods in small parcels.
 12668	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12669	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThat is to say she. Neatly she poured slowsyrupy sloe.
 12670	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12671	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Here’s fortune, Blazes said.
 12672	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12673	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe pitched a broad coin down. Coin rang.
 12674	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12675	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Hold on, said Lenehan, till I...
 12676	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12677	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Fortune, he wished, lifting his bubbled ale.
 12678	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12679	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Sceptre will win in a canter, he said.
 12680	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12681	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I plunged a bit, said Boylan winking and drinking. Not on my own, you
 12682	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknow. Fancy of a friend of mine.
 12683	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12684	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLenehan still drank and grinned at his tilted ale and at miss Douce’s
 12685	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlips that all but hummed, not shut, the oceansong her lips had trilled.
 12686	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIdolores. The eastern seas.
 12687	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12688	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tClock whirred. Miss Kennedy passed their way (flower, wonder who gave),
 12689	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbearing away teatray. Clock clacked.
 12690	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12691	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMiss Douce took Boylan’s coin, struck boldly the cashregister. It
 12692	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tclanged. Clock clacked. Fair one of Egypt teased and sorted in the till
 12693	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand hummed and handed coins in change. Look to the west. A clack. For
 12694	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tme.
 12695	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12696	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What time is that? asked Blazes Boylan. Four?
 12697	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12698	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tO’clock.
 12699	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12700	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLenehan, small eyes ahunger on her humming, bust ahumming, tugged Blazes
 12701	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBoylan’s elbowsleeve.
 12702	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12703	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Let’s hear the time, he said.
 12704	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12705	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe bag of Goulding, Collis, Ward led Bloom by ryebloom flowered tables.
 12706	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAimless he chose with agitated aim, bald Pat attending, a table near
 12707	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe door. Be near. At four. Has he forgotten? Perhaps a trick. Not come:
 12708	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhet appetite. I couldn’t do. Wait, wait. Pat, waiter, waited.
 12709	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t

 12711	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12712	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Go on, pressed Lenehan. There’s no-one. He never heard.
 12713	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12714	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—... to Flora’s lips did hie.
 12715	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12716	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHigh, a high note pealed in the treble clear.
 12717	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12718	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBronzedouce communing with her rose that sank and rose sought Blazes
 12719	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBoylan’s flower and eyes.
 12720	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12721	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Please, please.
 12722	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12723	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe pleaded over returning phrases of avowal.
 12724	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12725	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I could not leave thee...
 12726	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12727	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Afterwits, miss Douce promised coyly.
 12728	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12729	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—No, now, urged Lenehan. Sonnez la cloche! O do! There’s no-one.
 12730	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12731	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe looked. Quick. Miss Kenn out of earshot. Sudden bent. Two kindling
 12732	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfaces watched her bend.
 12733	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12734	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tQuavering the chords strayed from the air, found it again, lost chord,
 12735	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand lost and found it, faltering.
 12736	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12737	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Go on! Do! Sonnez!
 12738	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12739	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBending, she nipped a peak of skirt above her knee. Delayed. Taunted
 12740	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem still, bending, suspending, with wilful eyes.
 12741	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12742	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Sonnez!
 12743	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12744	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSmack. She set free sudden in rebound her nipped elastic garter
 12745	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsmackwarm against her smackable a woman’s warmhosed thigh.
 12746	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12747	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—La cloche! cried gleeful Lenehan. Trained by owner. No sawdust there.
 12748	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12749	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe smilesmirked supercilious (wept! aren’t men?), but, lightward
 12750	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgliding, mild she smiled on Boylan.
 12751	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12752	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You’re the essence of vulgarity, she in gliding said.
 12753	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12754	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBoylan, eyed, eyed. Tossed to fat lips his chalice, drank off his
 12755	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchalice tiny, sucking the last fat violet syrupy drops. His spellbound
 12756	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\teyes went after, after her gliding head as it went down the bar by
 12757	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmirrors, gilded arch for ginger ale, hock and claret glasses shimmering,
 12758	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta spiky shell, where it concerted, mirrored, bronze with sunnier bronze.
 12759	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12760	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tYes, bronze from anearby.
 12761	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12762	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—... Sweetheart, goodbye!
 12763	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12764	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I’m off, said Boylan with impatience.
 12765	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12766	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe slid his chalice brisk away, grasped his change.
 12767	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12768	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Wait a shake, begged Lenehan, drinking quickly. I wanted to tell you.
 12769	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTom Rochford...
 12770	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12771	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Come on to blazes, said Blazes Boylan, going.
 12772	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12773	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLenehan gulped to go.
 12774	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12775	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Got the horn or what? he said. Wait. I’m coming.
 12776	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12777	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe followed the hasty creaking shoes but stood by nimbly by the
 12778	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthreshold, saluting forms, a bulky with a slender.
 12779	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12780	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—How do you do, Mr Dollard?
 12781	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12782	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Eh? How do? How do? Ben Dollard’s vague bass answered, turning an
 12783	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinstant from Father Cowley’s woe. He won’t give you any trouble, Bob.
 12784	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAlf Bergan will speak to the long fellow. We’ll put a barleystraw in
 12785	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat Judas Iscariot’s ear this time.
 12786	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12787	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSighing Mr Dedalus came through the saloon, a finger soothing an eyelid.
 12788	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12789	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Hoho, we will, Ben Dollard yodled jollily. Come on, Simon. Give us a
 12790	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tditty. We heard the piano.
 12791	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12792	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBald Pat, bothered waiter, waited for drink orders. Power for Richie.
 12793	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd Bloom? Let me see. Not make him walk twice. His corns. Four now. How
 12794	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twarm this black is. Course nerves a bit. Refracts (is it?) heat. Let me
 12795	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsee. Cider. Yes, bottle of cider.
 12796	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12797	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What’s that? Mr Dedalus said. I was only vamping, man.
 12798	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12799	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Come on, come on, Ben Dollard called. Begone dull care. Come, Bob.
 12800	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12801	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe ambled Dollard, bulky slops, before them (hold that fellow with the:
 12802	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thold him now) into the saloon. He plumped him Dollard on the stool. His
 12803	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgouty paws plumped chords. Plumped, stopped abrupt.
 12804	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12805	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBald Pat in the doorway met tealess gold returning. Bothered, he wanted
 12806	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPower and cider. Bronze by the window, watched, bronze from afar.
 12807	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 12808	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJingle a tinkle jaunted.
 12809	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t

 14013	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tme a wrinkle about him—lifted any God’s quantity of tea and sugar to

 14060	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14061	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What about paying our respects to our friend? says Joe.
 14062	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14063	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Who? says I. Sure, he’s out in John of God’s off his head, poor man.
 14064	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14065	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Drinking his own stuff? says Joe.
 14066	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14067	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ay, says I. Whisky and water on the brain.

 14069	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Come around to Barney Kiernan’s, says Joe. I want to see the citizen.
 14070	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14071	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Barney mavourneen’s be it, says I. Anything strange or wonderful, Joe?
 14072	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14073	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Not a word, says Joe. I was up at that meeting in the City Arms.
 14074	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14075	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—-What was that, Joe? says I.
 14076	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14077	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Cattle traders, says Joe, about the foot and mouth disease. I want to
 14078	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgive the citizen the hard word about it.
 14079	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14080	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSo we went around by the Linenhall barracks and the back of the
 14081	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcourthouse talking of one thing or another. Decent fellow Joe when he
 14082	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thas it but sure like that he never has it. Jesus, I couldn’t get over
 14083	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat bloody foxy Geraghty, the daylight robber. For trading without a

 14086	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIn Inisfail the fair there lies a land, the land of holy Michan. There
 14087	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trises a watchtower beheld of men afar. There sleep the mighty dead as in
 14088	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlife they slept, warriors and princes of high renown. A pleasant land
 14089	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit is in sooth of murmuring waters, fishful streams where sport the
 14090	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgurnard, the plaice, the roach, the halibut, the gibbed haddock, the
 14091	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgrilse, the dab, the brill, the flounder, the pollock, the mixed coarse
 14092	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfish generally and other denizens of the aqueous kingdom too numerous to
 14093	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbe enumerated. In the mild breezes of the west and of the east the lofty
 14094	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttrees wave in different directions their firstclass foliage, the wafty
 14095	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsycamore, the Lebanonian cedar, the exalted planetree, the eugenic
 14096	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\teucalyptus and other ornaments of the arboreal world with which
 14097	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat region is thoroughly well supplied. Lovely maidens sit in close
 14098	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tproximity to the roots of the lovely trees singing the most lovely songs
 14099	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhile they play with all kinds of lovely objects as for example golden
 14100	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tingots, silvery fishes, crans of herrings, drafts of eels, codlings,
 14101	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcreels of fingerlings, purple seagems and playful insects. And heroes
 14102	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvoyage from afar to woo them, from Eblana to Slievemargy, the peerless
 14103	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprinces of unfettered Munster and of Connacht the just and of smooth
 14104	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsleek Leinster and of Cruachan’s land and of Armagh the splendid and of
 14105	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe noble district of Boyle, princes, the sons of kings.
 14106	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14107	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd there rises a shining palace whose crystal glittering roof is seen
 14108	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby mariners who traverse the extensive sea in barks built expressly for
 14109	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat purpose, and thither come all herds and fatlings and firstfruits
 14110	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof that land for O’Connell Fitzsimon takes toll of them, a chieftain
 14111	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdescended from chieftains. Thither the extremely large wains bring
 14112	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfoison of the fields, flaskets of cauliflowers, floats of spinach,
 14113	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpineapple chunks, Rangoon beans, strikes of tomatoes, drums of figs,
 14114	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdrills of Swedes, spherical potatoes and tallies of iridescent kale,
 14115	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tYork and Savoy, and trays of onions, pearls of the earth, and punnets of
 14116	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmushrooms and custard marrows and fat vetches and bere and rape and red
 14117	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgreen yellow brown russet sweet big bitter ripe pomellated apples and
 14118	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchips of strawberries and sieves of gooseberries, pulpy and pelurious,
 14119	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand strawberries fit for princes and raspberries from their canes.
 14120	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14121	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI dare him, says he, and I doubledare him. Come out here, Geraghty, you
 14122	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnotorious bloody hill and dale robber!
 14123	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14124	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd by that way wend the herds innumerable of bellwethers and flushed
 14125	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tewes and shearling rams and lambs and stubble geese and medium steers
 14126	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand roaring mares and polled calves and longwools and storesheep and
 14127	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCuffe’s prime springers and culls and sowpigs and baconhogs and the
 14128	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvarious different varieties of highly distinguished swine and Angus
 14129	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\theifers and polly bulllocks of immaculate pedigree together with prime
 14130	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpremiated milchcows and beeves: and there is ever heard a trampling,
 14131	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcackling, roaring, lowing, bleating, bellowing, rumbling, grunting,
 14132	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchamping, chewing, of sheep and pigs and heavyhooved kine from
 14133	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpasturelands of Lusk and Rush and Carrickmines and from the streamy
 14134	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvales of Thomond, from the M’Gillicuddy’s reeks the inaccessible and
 14135	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlordly Shannon the unfathomable, and from the gentle declivities of the
 14136	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplace of the race of Kiar, their udders distended with superabundance of
 14137	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmilk and butts of butter and rennets of cheese and farmer’s firkins and
 14138	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttargets of lamb and crannocks of corn and oblong eggs in great hundreds,
 14139	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvarious in size, the agate with this dun.
 14140	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14141	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSo we turned into Barney Kiernan’s and there, sure enough, was the
 14142	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcitizen up in the corner having a great confab with himself and that
 14143	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbloody mangy mongrel, Garryowen, and he waiting for what the sky would
 14144	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdrop in the way of drink.
 14145	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14146	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—There he is, says I, in his gloryhole, with his cruiskeen lawn and his
 14147	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tload of papers, working for the cause.
 14148	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14149	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe bloody mongrel let a grouse out of him would give you the creeps. Be
 14150	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta corporal work of mercy if someone would take the life of that bloody
 14151	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdog. I’m told for a fact he ate a good part of the breeches off a
 14152	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconstabulary man in Santry that came round one time with a blue paper
 14153	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabout a licence.
 14154	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14155	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Stand and deliver, says he.
 14156	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14157	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That’s all right, citizen, says Joe. Friends here.
 14158	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14159	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Pass, friends, says he.
 14160	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14161	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThen he rubs his hand in his eye and says he:
 14162	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14163	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What’s your opinion of the times?
 14164	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14165	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDoing the rapparee and Rory of the hill. But, begob, Joe was equal to
 14166	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe occasion.
 14167	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14168	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I think the markets are on a rise, says he, sliding his hand down his
 14169	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfork.
 14170	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14171	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSo begob the citizen claps his paw on his knee and he says:
 14172	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14173	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Foreign wars is the cause of it.
 14174	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14175	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd says Joe, sticking his thumb in his pocket:
 14176	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14177	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—It’s the Russians wish to tyrannise.
 14178	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14179	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Arrah, give over your bloody codding, Joe, says I. I’ve a thirst on me
 14180	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI wouldn’t sell for half a crown.
 14181	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14182	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Give it a name, citizen, says Joe.
 14183	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14184	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Wine of the country, says he.
 14185	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14186	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What’s yours? says Joe.
 14187	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14188	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ditto MacAnaspey, says I.
 14189	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14190	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Three pints, Terry, says Joe. And how’s the old heart, citizen? says
 14191	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the.
 14192	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14193	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Never better, a chara, says he. What Garry? Are we going to win? Eh?
 14194	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14195	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck
 14196	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand, by Jesus, he near throttled him.
 14197	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14198	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was
 14199	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired

 14204	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbody wherever visible, with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in
 14205	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse (Ulex Europeus).
 14206	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe widewinged nostrils, from which bristles of the same tawny hue
 14207	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprojected, were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous
 14208	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tobscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest. The eyes
 14209	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the
 14210	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdimensions of a goodsized cauliflower. A powerful current of warm breath
 14211	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tissued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth
 14212	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhile in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his
 14213	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tformidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground, the summit of
 14214	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and
 14215	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttremble.
 14216	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14217	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching
 14218	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by
 14219	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta girdle of plaited straw and rushes. Beneath this he wore trews of
 14220	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdeerskin, roughly stitched with gut. His nether extremities were encased
 14221	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin high Balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple, the feet being shod
 14222	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same
 14223	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeast. From his girdle hung a row of seastones which jangled at every
 14224	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmovement of his portentous frame and on these were graven with rude
 14225	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyet striking art the tribal images of many Irish heroes and heroines of

 14250	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanimal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was
 14251	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsunk in uneasy slumber, a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and
 14252	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspasmodic movements which his master repressed from time to time
 14253	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of
 14254	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpaleolithic stone.
 14255	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14256	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSo anyhow Terry brought the three pints Joe was standing and begob the
 14257	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsight nearly left my eyes when I saw him land out a quid. O, as true as
 14258	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI’m telling you. A goodlooking sovereign.
 14259	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14260	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And there’s more where that came from, says he.
 14261	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14262	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Were you robbing the poorbox, Joe? says I.
 14263	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14264	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Sweat of my brow, says Joe. ‘Twas the prudent member gave me the
 14265	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twheeze.
 14266	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14267	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I saw him before I met you, says I, sloping around by Pill lane and
 14268	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGreek street with his cod’s eye counting up all the guts of the fish.
 14269	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14270	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWho comes through Michan’s land, bedight in sable armour? O’Bloom,
 14271	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe son of Rory: it is he. Impervious to fear is Rory’s son: he of the
 14272	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprudent soul.
 14273	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14274	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—For the old woman of Prince’s street, says the citizen, the subsidised
 14275	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\torgan. The pledgebound party on the floor of the house. And look at this
 14276	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblasted rag, says he. Look at this, says he. The Irish Independent, if
 14277	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou please, founded by Parnell to be the workingman’s friend. Listen to
 14278	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe births and deaths in the Irish all for Ireland Independent, and I’ll
 14279	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthank you and the marriages.
 14280	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14281	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd he starts reading them out:

 14283	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Gordon, Barnfield crescent, Exeter; Redmayne of Iffley, Saint Anne’s on
 14284	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSea: the wife of William T Redmayne of a son. How’s that, eh? Wright and

 14289	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStoke Newington, of gastritis and heart disease: Cockburn, at the Moat
 14290	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thouse, Chepstow...
 14291	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14292	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I know that fellow, says Joe, from bitter experience.
 14293	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14294	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Cockburn. Dimsey, wife of David Dimsey, late of the admiralty: Miller,
 14295	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTottenham, aged eightyfive: Welsh, June 12, at 35 Canning street,
 14296	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLiverpool, Isabella Helen. How’s that for a national press, eh, my brown
 14297	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tson! How’s that for Martin Murphy, the Bantry jobber?
 14298	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14299	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ah, well, says Joe, handing round the boose. Thanks be to God they had
 14300	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe start of us. Drink that, citizen.
 14301	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14302	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I will, says he, honourable person.
 14303	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14304	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Health, Joe, says I. And all down the form.
 14305	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14306	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAh! Ow! Don’t be talking! I was blue mouldy for the want of that pint.
 14307	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDeclare to God I could hear it hit the pit of my stomach with a click.
 14308	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14309	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd lo, as they quaffed their cup of joy, a godlike messenger came
 14310	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tswiftly in, radiant as the eye of heaven, a comely youth and behind him
 14311	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthere passed an elder of noble gait and countenance, bearing the sacred
 14312	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tscrolls of law and with him his lady wife a dame of peerless lineage,
 14313	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfairest of her race.
 14314	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14315	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLittle Alf Bergan popped in round the door and hid behind Barney’s
 14316	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsnug, squeezed up with the laughing. And who was sitting up there in
 14317	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe corner that I hadn’t seen snoring drunk blind to the world only Bob
 14318	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDoran. I didn’t know what was up and Alf kept making signs out of the
 14319	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdoor. And begob what was it only that bloody old pantaloon Denis Breen
 14320	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin his bathslippers with two bloody big books tucked under his oxter and
 14321	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe wife hotfoot after him, unfortunate wretched woman, trotting like a
 14322	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpoodle. I thought Alf would split.
 14323	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14324	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Look at him, says he. Breen. He’s traipsing all round Dublin with a
 14325	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpostcard someone sent him with U.P.: up on it to take a li...
 14326	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14327	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd he doubled up.
 14328	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14329	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Take a what? says I.
 14330	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14331	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Libel action, says he, for ten thousand pounds.
 14332	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14333	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O hell! says I.
 14334	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14335	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe bloody mongrel began to growl that’d put the fear of God in you
 14336	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseeing something was up but the citizen gave him a kick in the ribs.
 14337	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14338	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Bi i dho husht, says he.
 14339	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14340	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Who? says Joe.
 14341	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14342	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Breen, says Alf. He was in John Henry Menton’s and then he went round
 14343	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto Collis and Ward’s and then Tom Rochford met him and sent him round to
 14344	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe subsheriff’s for a lark. O God, I’ve a pain laughing. U. p: up. The
 14345	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlong fellow gave him an eye as good as a process and now the bloody old
 14346	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlunatic is gone round to Green street to look for a G man.
 14347	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14348	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—When is long John going to hang that fellow in Mountjoy? says Joe.
 14349	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14350	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Bergan, says Bob Doran, waking up. Is that Alf Bergan?
 14351	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14352	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, says Alf. Hanging? Wait till I show you. Here, Terry, give us a
 14353	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpony. That bloody old fool! Ten thousand pounds. You should have seen
 14354	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlong John’s eye. U.P....
 14355	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14356	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd he started laughing.
 14357	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14358	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran. Is that Bergan?
 14359	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14360	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Hurry up, Terry boy, says Alf.
 14361	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14362	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTerence O’Ryan heard him and straightway brought him a crystal cup
 14363	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfull of the foamy ebon ale which the noble twin brothers Bungiveagh and
 14364	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBungardilaun brew ever in their divine alevats, cunning as the sons of
 14365	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdeathless Leda. For they garner the succulent berries of the hop and
 14366	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmass and sift and bruise and brew them and they mix therewith sour
 14367	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjuices and bring the must to the sacred fire and cease not night or day
 14368	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom their toil, those cunning brothers, lords of the vat.
 14369	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14370	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThen did you, chivalrous Terence, hand forth, as to the manner born,
 14371	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat nectarous beverage and you offered the crystal cup to him that
 14372	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthirsted, the soul of chivalry, in beauty akin to the immortals.
 14373	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14374	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut he, the young chief of the O’Bergan’s, could ill brook to be outdone
 14375	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin generous deeds but gave therefor with gracious gesture a testoon of
 14376	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcostliest bronze. Thereon embossed in excellent smithwork was seen
 14377	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe image of a queen of regal port, scion of the house of Brunswick,
 14378	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tVictoria her name, Her Most Excellent Majesty, by grace of God of the
 14379	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British dominions
 14380	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeyond the sea, queen, defender of the faith, Empress of India, even
 14381	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe, who bore rule, a victress over many peoples, the wellbeloved, for
 14382	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey knew and loved her from the rising of the sun to the going down
 14383	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthereof, the pale, the dark, the ruddy and the ethiop.
 14384	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14385	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What’s that bloody freemason doing, says the citizen, prowling up and
 14386	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdown outside?
 14387	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14388	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What’s that? says Joe.
 14389	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14390	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Here you are, says Alf, chucking out the rhino. Talking about hanging,
 14391	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI’ll show you something you never saw. Hangmen’s letters. Look at here.
 14392	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14393	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSo he took a bundle of wisps of letters and envelopes out of his pocket.
 14394	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14395	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Are you codding? says I.
 14396	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14397	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Honest injun, says Alf. Read them.
 14398	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14399	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSo Joe took up the letters.
 14400	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14401	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Who are you laughing at? says Bob Doran.
 14402	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14403	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSo I saw there was going to be a bit of a dust Bob’s a queer chap when
 14404	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe porter’s up in him so says I just to make talk:
 14405	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14406	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—How’s Willy Murray those times, Alf?
 14407	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14408	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I don’t know, says Alf I saw him just now in Capel street with Paddy
 14409	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDignam. Only I was running after that...
 14410	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14411	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You what? says Joe, throwing down the letters. With who?
 14412	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14413	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—With Dignam, says Alf.
 14414	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14415	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Is it Paddy? says Joe.
 14416	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14417	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, says Alf. Why?
 14418	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14419	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Don’t you know he’s dead? says Joe.
 14420	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14421	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Paddy Dignam dead! says Alf.
 14422	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14423	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ay, says Joe.
 14424	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14425	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Sure I’m after seeing him not five minutes ago, says Alf, as plain as a
 14426	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpikestaff.
 14427	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14428	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Who’s dead? says Bob Doran.
 14429	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14430	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You saw his ghost then, says Joe, God between us and harm.
 14431	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14432	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What? says Alf. Good Christ, only five... What?... And Willy Murray
 14433	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith him, the two of them there near whatdoyoucallhim’s... What? Dignam
 14434	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdead?
 14435	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14436	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What about Dignam? says Bob Doran. Who’s talking about...?
 14437	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14438	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Dead! says Alf. He’s no more dead than you are.
 14439	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14440	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Maybe so, says Joe. They took the liberty of burying him this morning
 14441	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanyhow.
 14442	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14443	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Paddy? says Alf.
 14444	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14445	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ay, says Joe. He paid the debt of nature, God be merciful to him.
 14446	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14447	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Good Christ! says Alf.
 14448	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14449	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBegob he was what you might call flabbergasted.
 14450	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14451	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIn the darkness spirit hands were felt to flutter and when prayer by
 14452	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttantras had been directed to the proper quarter a faint but increasing
 14453	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tluminosity of ruby light became gradually visible, the apparition of
 14454	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe etheric double being particularly lifelike owing to the discharge
 14455	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof jivic rays from the crown of the head and face. Communication was
 14456	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\teffected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery
 14457	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus.
 14458	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tQuestioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he
 14459	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstated that he was now on the path of pralaya or return but was still
 14460	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsubmitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the
 14461	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlower astral levels. In reply to a question as to his first sensations
 14462	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a
 14463	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities
 14464	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof atmic development opened up to them. Interrogated as to whether life
 14465	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthere resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard
 14466	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were
 14467	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tequipped with every modern home comfort such as talafana, alavatar,
 14468	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thatakalda, wataklasat and that the highest adepts were steeped in
 14469	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twaves of volupcy of the very purest nature. Having requested a quart of
 14470	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbuttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief. Asked if he
 14471	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the
 14472	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twrong side of Maya to acknowledge the true path for it was reported
 14473	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were out for mischief on the
 14474	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\teastern angle where the ram has power. It was then queried whether there
 14475	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was:
 14476	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWe greet you, friends of earth, who are still in the body. Mind C. K.
 14477	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdoesn’t pile it on. It was ascertained that the reference was to Mr
 14478	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCornelius Kelleher, manager of Messrs H. J. O’Neill’s popular
 14479	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfuneral establishment, a personal friend of the defunct, who had been
 14480	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tresponsible for the carrying out of the interment arrangements. Before
 14481	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdeparting he requested that it should be told to his dear son Patsy that
 14482	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe other boot which he had been looking for was at present under the
 14483	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcommode in the return room and that the pair should be sent to Cullen’s
 14484	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto be soled only as the heels were still good. He stated that this had
 14485	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgreatly perturbed his peace of mind in the other region and earnestly
 14486	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trequested that his desire should be made known.
 14487	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14488	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAssurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was
 14489	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tintimated that this had given satisfaction.
 14490	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14491	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe is gone from mortal haunts: O’Dignam, sun of our morning. Fleet was
 14492	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this foot on the bracken: Patrick of the beamy brow. Wail, Banba, with
 14493	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyour wind: and wail, O ocean, with your whirlwind.
 14494	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14495	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—There he is again, says the citizen, staring out.
 14496	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14497	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Who? says I.
 14498	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14499	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Bloom, says he. He’s on point duty up and down there for the last ten
 14500	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tminutes.
 14501	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14502	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd, begob, I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again.
 14503	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14504	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLittle Alf was knocked bawways. Faith, he was.
 14505	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14506	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Good Christ! says he. I could have sworn it was him.
 14507	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14508	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd says Bob Doran, with the hat on the back of his poll, lowest
 14509	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblackguard in Dublin when he’s under the influence:
 14510	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14511	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Who said Christ is good?
 14512	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14513	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I beg your parsnips, says Alf.
 14514	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14515	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Is that a good Christ, says Bob Doran, to take away poor little Willy
 14516	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDignam?
 14517	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14518	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ah, well, says Alf, trying to pass it off. He’s over all his troubles.
 14519	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14520	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut Bob Doran shouts out of him.
 14521	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14522	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—He’s a bloody ruffian, I say, to take away poor little Willy Dignam.
 14523	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14524	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTerry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet, that they didn’t
 14525	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twant that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises. And Bob Doran
 14526	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstarts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam, true as you’re there.
 14527	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14528	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The finest man, says he, snivelling, the finest purest character.
 14529	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14530	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe tear is bloody near your eye. Talking through his bloody hat. Fitter
 14531	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married, Mooney, the
 14532	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbumbailiff’s daughter, mother kept a kip in Hardwicke street, that
 14533	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tused to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told me that was
 14534	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her, exposing
 14535	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther person, open to all comers, fair field and no favour.
 14536	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14537	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The noblest, the truest, says he. And he’s gone, poor little Willy,
 14538	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpoor little Paddy Dignam.
 14539	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14540	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that
 14541	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeam of heaven.
 14542	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14543	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOld Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round
 14544	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe door.
 14545	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14546	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Come in, come on, he won’t eat you, says the citizen.
 14547	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14548	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSo Bloom slopes in with his cod’s eye on the dog and he asks Terry was
 14549	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMartin Cunningham there.
 14550	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14551	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O, Christ M’Keown, says Joe, reading one of the letters. Listen to
 14552	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthis, will you?
 14553	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14554	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd he starts reading out one.
 14555	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14556	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t      7 Hunter Street,
 14557	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t      Liverpool.
 14558	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t      To the High Sheriff of Dublin,
 14559	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t      Dublin.
 14560	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14561	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHonoured sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful
 14562	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcase i hanged Joe Gann in Bootle jail on the 12 of Febuary 1900 and i
 14563	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thanged...
 14564	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14565	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Show us, Joe, says I.
 14566	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14567	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—... private Arthur Chace for fowl murder of Jessie Tilsit in
 14568	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPentonville prison and i was assistant when...
 14569	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14570	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Jesus, says I.
 14571	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14572	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—... Billington executed the awful murderer Toad Smith...
 14573	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14574	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe citizen made a grab at the letter.
 14575	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14576	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Hold hard, says Joe, i have a special nack of putting the noose once in
 14577	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the can’t get out hoping to be favoured i remain, honoured sir, my terms
 14578	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tis five ginnees.
 14579	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14580	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t      H. Rumbold,
 14581	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t      Master Barber.
 14582	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14583	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too, says the citizen.
 14584	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14585	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And the dirty scrawl of the wretch, says Joe. Here, says he, take them
 14586	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto hell out of my sight, Alf. Hello, Bloom, says he, what will you have?
 14587	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14588	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSo they started arguing about the point, Bloom saying he wouldn’t and he
 14589	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcouldn’t and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well
 14590	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the’d just take a cigar. Gob, he’s a prudent member and no mistake.
 14591	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14592	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Give us one of your prime stinkers, Terry, says Joe.
 14593	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14594	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a
 14595	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblack border round it.
 14596	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14597	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—They’re all barbers, says he, from the black country that would hang
 14598	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses.
 14599	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14600	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd he was telling us there’s two fellows waiting below to pull his
 14601	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\theels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they
 14602	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull.
 14603	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14604	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIn the dark land they bide, the vengeful knights of the razor. Their
 14605	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdeadly coil they grasp: yea, and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever
 14606	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so
 14607	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaith the Lord.
 14608	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14609	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSo they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom
 14610	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcomes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the
 14611	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbusiness and the old dog smelling him all the time I’m told those jewies
 14612	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdoes have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about I don’t
 14613	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknow what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on.
 14614	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14615	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—There’s one thing it hasn’t a deterrent effect on, says Alf.
 14616	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14617	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What’s that? says Joe.
 14618	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14619	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The poor bugger’s tool that’s being hanged, says Alf.
 14620	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14621	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That so? says Joe.
 14622	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14623	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—God’s truth, says Alf. I heard that from the head warder that was in
 14624	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady, the invincible. He told me when
 14625	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like
 14626	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta poker.
 14627	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14628	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ruling passion strong in death, says Joe, as someone said.
 14629	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14630	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That can be explained by science, says Bloom. It’s only a natural
 14631	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tphenomenon, don’t you see, because on account of the...
 14632	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14633	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and
 14634	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthis phenomenon and the other phenomenon.
 14635	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14636	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered
 14637	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmedical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the
 14638	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would,
 14639	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\taccording to the best approved tradition of medical science, be
 14640	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcalculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent
 14641	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus,
 14642	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthereby causing the elastic pores of the corpora cavernosa to rapidly
 14643	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood
 14644	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ
 14645	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tresulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a
 14646	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmorbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection in articulo mortis
 14647	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tper diminutionem capitis.
 14648	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14649	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSo of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and
 14650	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and
 14651	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe with
 14652	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim about all the fellows that were hanged, drawn and transported for
 14653	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this, that
 14654	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand the other. Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a new
 14655	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdog so he ought. Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round
 14656	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe place and scratching his scabs. And round he goes to Bob Doran that
 14657	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could get. So of
 14658	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcourse Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him:
 14659	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14660	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Give us the paw! Give the paw, doggy! Good old doggy! Give the paw
 14661	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\there! Give us the paw!
 14662	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14663	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tArrah, bloody end to the paw he’d paw and Alf trying to keep him from
 14664	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking
 14665	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and
 14666	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tintelligent dog: give you the bloody pip. Then he starts scraping a few
 14667	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs’ tin he told Terry to
 14668	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbring. Gob, he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging
 14669	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout of him a yard long for more. Near ate the tin and all, hungry bloody
 14670	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmongrel.
 14671	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14672	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point, the
 14673	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet
 14674	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand die for your country, the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and
 14675	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe’s far from the land. And Bloom, of course, with his knockmedown
 14676	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcigar putting on swank with his lardy face. Phenomenon! The fat heap he
 14677	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmarried is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley.
 14678	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTime they were stopping up in the City Arms pisser Burke told me there
 14679	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and Bloom
 14680	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttrying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing bézique
 14681	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a
 14682	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFriday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the
 14683	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlout out for a walk. And one time he led him the rounds of Dublin and,
 14684	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby the holy farmer, he never cried crack till he brought him home as
 14685	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdrunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of
 14686	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\talcohol and by herrings, if the three women didn’t near roast him, it’s
 14687	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta queer story, the old one, Bloom’s wife and Mrs O’Dowd that kept the
 14688	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thotel. Jesus, I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them off chewing the
 14689	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfat. And Bloom with his but don’t you see? and but on the other hand.
 14690	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd sure, more be token, the lout I’m told was in Power’s after, the
 14691	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblender’s, round in Cope street going home footless in a cab five times
 14692	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody
 14693	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\testablishment. Phenomenon!
 14694	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14695	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The memory of the dead, says the citizen taking up his pintglass and
 14696	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglaring at Bloom.
 14697	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14698	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ay, ay, says Joe.
 14699	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14700	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You don’t grasp my point, says Bloom. What I mean is...
 14701	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14702	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Sinn Fein! says the citizen. Sinn Fein amhain! The friends we love are
 14703	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby our side and the foes we hate before us.
 14704	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14705	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe last farewell was affecting in the extreme. From the belfries far
 14706	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand near the funereal deathbell tolled unceasingly while all around the
 14707	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgloomy precincts rolled the ominous warning of a hundred muffled drums
 14708	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpunctuated by the hollow booming of pieces of ordnance. The deafening
 14709	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tclaps of thunder and the dazzling flashes of lightning which lit up
 14710	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe ghastly scene testified that the artillery of heaven had lent its
 14711	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsupernatural pomp to the already gruesome spectacle. A torrential rain
 14712	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpoured down from the floodgates of the angry heavens upon the
 14713	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbared heads of the assembled multitude which numbered at the
 14714	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlowest computation five hundred thousand persons. A posse of Dublin
 14715	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMetropolitan police superintended by the Chief Commissioner in person
 14716	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmaintained order in the vast throng for whom the York street brass and
 14717	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\treed band whiled away the intervening time by admirably rendering on
 14718	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir blackdraped instruments the matchless melody endeared to us from
 14719	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe cradle by Speranza’s plaintive muse. Special quick excursion trains
 14720	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand upholstered charabancs had been provided for the comfort of our
 14721	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcountry cousins of whom there were large contingents. Considerable
 14722	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tamusement was caused by the favourite Dublin streetsingers L-n-h-n and
 14723	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tM-ll-g-n who sang The Night before Larry was stretched in their usual
 14724	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmirth-provoking fashion. Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade
 14725	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody
 14726	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twho has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity
 14727	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twill grudge them their hardearned pennies. The children of the Male and
 14728	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFemale Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene
 14729	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere delighted with this unexpected addition to the day’s entertainment
 14730	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the Poor for their
 14731	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\texcellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children
 14732	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta genuinely instructive treat. The viceregal houseparty which included
 14733	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmany wellknown ladies was chaperoned by Their Excellencies to the most
 14734	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfavourable positions on the grandstand while the picturesque foreign
 14735	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdelegation known as the Friends of the Emerald Isle was accommodated
 14736	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton a tribune directly opposite. The delegation, present in full force,
 14737	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconsisted of Commendatore Bacibaci Beninobenone (the semiparalysed doyen
 14738	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the party who had to be assisted to his seat by the aid of a
 14739	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpowerful steam crane), Monsieur Pierrepaul Petitépatant, the Grandjoker

 14750	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthemselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning
 14751	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe nameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness. An
 14752	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanimated altercation (in which all took part) ensued among the F. O.
 14753	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tT. E. I. as to whether the eighth or the ninth of March was the correct
 14754	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdate of the birth of Ireland’s patron saint. In the course of the
 14755	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\targument cannonballs, scimitars, boomerangs, blunderbusses, stinkpots,
 14756	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmeatchoppers, umbrellas, catapults, knuckledusters, sandbags, lumps
 14757	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof pig iron were resorted to and blows were freely exchanged. The
 14758	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbaby policeman, Constable MacFadden, summoned by special courier from
 14759	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBooterstown, quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude
 14760	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tproposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable
 14761	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor both contending parties. The readywitted ninefooter’s suggestion at
 14762	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tonce appealed to all and was unanimously accepted. Constable MacFadden
 14763	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas heartily congratulated by all the F. O. T. E. I., several of
 14764	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhom were bleeding profusely. Commendatore Beninobenone having been
 14765	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\textricated from underneath the presidential armchair, it was explained
 14766	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby his legal adviser Avvocato Pagamimi that the various articles
 14767	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsecreted in his thirtytwo pockets had been abstracted by him during the
 14768	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\taffray from the pockets of his junior colleagues in the hope of bringing
 14769	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem to their senses. The objects (which included several hundred
 14770	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tladies’ and gentlemen’s gold and silver watches) were promptly restored
 14771	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto their rightful owners and general harmony reigned supreme.
 14772	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14773	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tQuietly, unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless
 14774	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmorning dress and wearing his favourite flower, the Gladiolus Cruentus.
 14775	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe announced his presence by that gentle Rumboldian cough which so many
 14776	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thave tried (unsuccessfully) to imitate—short, painstaking yet withal so
 14777	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcharacteristic of the man. The arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was
 14778	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgreeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse, the viceregal
 14779	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even
 14780	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmore excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of
 14781	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcries, hoch, banzai, eljen, zivio, chinchin, polla kronia, hiphip, vive,
 14782	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAllah, amid which the ringing evviva of the delegate of the land of song
 14783	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t(a high double F recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which
 14784	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe eunuch Catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers) was easily
 14785	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdistinguishable. It was exactly seventeen o’clock. The signal for prayer
 14786	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were
 14787	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbared, the commendatore’s patriarchal sombrero, which has been in the
 14788	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpossession of his family since the revolution of Rienzi, being removed
 14789	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby his medical adviser in attendance, Dr Pippi. The learned prelate who
 14790	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tadministered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when
 14791	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabout to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a
 14792	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpool of rainwater, his cassock above his hoary head, and offered up to
 14793	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication. Hand by the block
 14794	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstood the grim figure of the executioner, his visage being concealed in
 14795	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his
 14796	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\teyes glowered furiously. As he awaited the fatal signal he tested the
 14797	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tedge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or
 14798	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdecapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided
 14799	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby the admirers of his fell but necessary office. On a handsome mahogany
 14800	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttable near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife, the various
 14801	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfinely tempered disembowelling appliances (specially supplied by the
 14802	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tworldfamous firm of cutlers, Messrs John Round and Sons, Sheffield),
 14803	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum, colon,
 14804	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two
 14805	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcommodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the
 14806	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmost precious victim. The housesteward of the amalgamated cats’ and
 14807	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdogs’ home was in attendance to convey these vessels when replenished
 14808	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto that beneficent institution. Quite an excellent repast consisting of
 14809	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trashers and eggs, fried steak and onions, done to a nicety, delicious
 14810	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided
 14811	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the
 14812	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced
 14813	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he,
 14814	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith an abnegation rare in these our times, rose nobly to the occasion
 14815	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand expressed the dying wish (immediately acceded to) that the meal
 14816	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshould be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and
 14817	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tindigent roomkeepers’ association as a token of his regard and esteem.
 14818	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe nec and non plus ultra of emotion were reached when the blushing
 14819	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders
 14820	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be
 14821	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlaunched into eternity for her sake. The hero folded her willowy form in
 14822	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta loving embrace murmuring fondly Sheila, my own. Encouraged by this use
 14823	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof her christian name she kissed passionately all the various suitable
 14824	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tareas of his person which the decencies of prison garb permitted her
 14825	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tardour to reach. She swore to him as they mingled the salt streams of
 14826	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir tears that she would ever cherish his memory, that she would never
 14827	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tforget her hero boy who went to his death with a song on his lips as if
 14828	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the were but going to a hurling match in Clonturk park. She brought back
 14829	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the
 14830	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbanks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes
 14831	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the young and, oblivious of the dreadful present, they both laughed
 14832	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\theartily, all the spectators, including the venerable pastor, joining in
 14833	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe general merriment. That monster audience simply rocked with delight.
 14834	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the
 14835	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlast time. A fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts
 14836	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand the vast concourse of people, touched to the inmost core, broke
 14837	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinto heartrending sobs, not the least affected being the aged prebendary
 14838	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thimself. Big strong men, officers of the peace and genial giants of the
 14839	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\troyal Irish constabulary, were making frank use of their handkerchiefs
 14840	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record
 14841	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tassemblage. A most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young
 14842	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOxford graduate, noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex, stepped
 14843	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tforward and, presenting his visiting card, bankbook and genealogical
 14844	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttree, solicited the hand of the hapless young lady, requesting her to
 14845	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tname the day, and was accepted on the spot. Every lady in the audience
 14846	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of
 14847	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta skull and crossbones brooch, a timely and generous act which evoked
 14848	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta fresh outburst of emotion: and when the gallant young Oxonian (the
 14849	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbearer, by the way, of one of the most timehonoured names in Albion’s
 14850	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thistory) placed on the finger of his blushing fiancée an expensive
 14851	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tengagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock
 14852	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe excitement knew no bounds. Nay, even the stern provostmarshal,
 14853	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlieutenantcolonel Tomkin-Maxwell ffrenchmullan Tomlinson, who presided
 14854	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton the sad occasion, he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys
 14855	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom the cannonmouth without flinching, could not now restrain his
 14856	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnatural emotion. With his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear
 14857	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand was overheard, by those privileged burghers who happened to be in
 14858	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this immediate entourage, to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone:
 14859	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14860	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—God blimey if she aint a clinker, that there bleeding tart. Blimey it
 14861	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmakes me kind of bleeding cry, straight, it does, when I sees her cause
 14862	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI thinks of my old mashtub what’s waiting for me down Limehouse way.
 14863	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14864	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSo then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the
 14865	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcorporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can’t speak
 14866	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a
 14867	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tquid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that
 14868	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the
 14869	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tantitreating league and drink, the curse of Ireland. Antitreating is
 14870	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabout the size of it. Gob, he’d let you pour all manner of drink down
 14871	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this throat till the Lord would call him before you’d ever see the froth
 14872	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof his pint. And one night I went in with a fellow into one of their
 14873	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmusical evenings, song and dance about she could get up on a truss of
 14874	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thay she could my Maureen Lay and there was a fellow with a Ballyhooly
 14875	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblue ribbon badge spiffing out of him in Irish and a lot of colleen
 14876	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbawns going about with temperance beverages and selling medals
 14877	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand oranges and lemonade and a few old dry buns, gob, flahoolagh
 14878	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tentertainment, don’t be talking. Ireland sober is Ireland free. And
 14879	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthen an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers
 14880	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of. And one or two
 14881	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the
 14882	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfemales, hitting below the belt.
 14883	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14884	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSo howandever, as I was saying, the old dog seeing the tin was empty
 14885	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstarts mousing around by Joe and me. I’d train him by kindness, so I
 14886	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould, if he was my dog. Give him a rousing fine kick now and again
 14887	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhere it wouldn’t blind him.
 14888	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14889	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Afraid he’ll bite you? says the citizen, jeering.
 14890	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14891	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—No, says I. But he might take my leg for a lamppost.
 14892	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14893	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSo he calls the old dog over.
 14894	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14895	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What’s on you, Garry? says he.
 14896	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14897	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThen he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the
 14898	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\told towser growling, letting on to answer, like a duet in the opera.
 14899	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSuch growling you never heard as they let off between them. Someone that
 14900	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thas nothing better to do ought to write a letter pro bono publico to the
 14901	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpapers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that. Growling
 14902	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the
 14903	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thydrophobia dropping out of his jaws.
 14904	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14905	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAll those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the
 14906	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlower animals (and their name is legion) should make a point of not
 14907	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmissing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the
 14908	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfamous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the sobriquet of
 14909	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGarryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and
 14910	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tacquaintances Owen Garry. The exhibition, which is the result of years
 14911	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof training by kindness and a carefully thoughtout dietary system,
 14912	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcomprises, among other achievements, the recitation of verse. Our
 14913	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgreatest living phonetic expert (wild horses shall not drag it from us!)
 14914	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thas left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the
 14915	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tverse recited and has found it bears a striking resemblance (the italics
 14916	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tare ours) to the ranns of ancient Celtic bards. We are not speaking so
 14917	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmuch of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals
 14918	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this identity under the graceful pseudonym of the Little Sweet Branch has
 14919	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfamiliarised the bookloving world but rather (as a contributor D. O.
 14920	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tC. points out in an interesting communication published by an evening
 14921	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcontemporary) of the harsher and more personal note which is found in
 14922	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe satirical effusions of the famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine
 14923	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the
 14924	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpublic eye. We subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into English
 14925	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty
 14926	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical
 14927	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tallusion rather more than an indication. The metrical system of
 14928	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe canine original, which recalls the intricate alliterative and
 14929	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tisosyllabic rules of the Welsh englyn, is infinitely more complicated
 14930	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbut we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well
 14931	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcaught. Perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased
 14932	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tif Owen’s verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone
 14933	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuggestive of suppressed rancour.
 14934	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14935	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     The curse of my curses
 14936	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     Seven days every day
 14937	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     And seven dry Thursdays
 14938	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     On you, Barney Kiernan,
 14939	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     Has no sup of water
 14940	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     To cool my courage,
 14941	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     And my guts red roaring
 14942	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     After Lowry’s lights.
 14943	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14944	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSo he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and, gob, you could
 14945	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thear him lapping it up a mile off. And Joe asked him would he have
 14946	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanother.
 14947	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14948	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I will, says he, a chara, to show there’s no ill feeling.
 14949	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14950	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGob, he’s not as green as he’s cabbagelooking. Arsing around from one
 14951	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpub to another, leaving it to your own honour, with old Giltrap’s dog
 14952	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand getting fed up by the ratepayers and corporators. Entertainment for
 14953	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tman and beast. And says Joe:
 14954	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14955	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Could you make a hole in another pint?
 14956	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14957	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Could a swim duck? says I.
 14958	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14959	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Same again, Terry, says Joe. Are you sure you won’t have anything in
 14960	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe way of liquid refreshment? says he.
 14961	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14962	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Thank you, no, says Bloom. As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet
 14963	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMartin Cunningham, don’t you see, about this insurance of poor Dignam’s.
 14964	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMartin asked me to go to the house. You see, he, Dignam, I mean, didn’t
 14965	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tserve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and
 14966	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnominally under the act the mortgagee can’t recover on the policy.
 14967	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14968	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Holy Wars, says Joe, laughing, that’s a good one if old Shylock is
 14969	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlanded. So the wife comes out top dog, what?
 14970	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14971	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Well, that’s a point, says Bloom, for the wife’s admirers.
 14972	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14973	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Whose admirers? says Joe.
 14974	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14975	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The wife’s advisers, I mean, says Bloom.
 14976	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14977	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThen he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act
 14978	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlike the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit
 14979	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that
 14980	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow
 14981	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcontested the mortgagee’s right till he near had the head of me addled
 14982	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith his mortgagor under the act. He was bloody safe he wasn’t run in
 14983	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thimself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a
 14984	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfriend in court. Selling bazaar tickets or what do you call it royal
 14985	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHungarian privileged lottery. True as you’re there. O, commend me to an
 14986	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tisraelite! Royal and privileged Hungarian robbery.
 14987	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14988	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSo Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he
 14989	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and
 14990	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was
 14991	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnever a truer, a finer than poor little Willy that’s dead to tell her.
 14992	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tChoking with bloody foolery. And shaking Bloom’s hand doing the tragic
 14993	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto tell her that. Shake hands, brother. You’re a rogue and I’m another.
 14994	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 14995	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Let me, said he, so far presume upon our acquaintance which, however
 14996	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tslight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time, is founded,
 14997	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas I hope and believe, on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of
 14998	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou this favour. But, should I have overstepped the limits of reserve
 14999	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlet the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness.
 15000	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15001	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—No, rejoined the other, I appreciate to the full the motives which
 15002	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tactuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust to
 15003	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tme consoled by the reflection that, though the errand be one of sorrow,
 15004	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthis proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of
 15005	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe cup.
 15006	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15007	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Then suffer me to take your hand, said he. The goodness of your heart,
 15008	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI feel sure, will dictate to you better than my inadequate words
 15009	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose
 15010	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpoignancy, were I to give vent to my feelings, would deprive me even of
 15011	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspeech.
 15012	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15013	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd off with him and out trying to walk straight. Boosed at five
 15014	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\to’clock. Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the
 15015	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbobby, 14A. Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after
 15016	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tclosing time, fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard, drinking
 15017	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tporter out of teacups. And calling himself a Frenchy for the shawls,
 15018	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJoseph Manuo, and talking against the Catholic religion, and he serving
 15019	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmass in Adam and Eve’s when he was young with his eyes shut, who wrote
 15020	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe new testament, and the old testament, and hugging and smugging. And
 15021	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe two shawls killed with the laughing, picking his pockets, the bloody
 15022	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls
 15023	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tscreeching laughing at one another. How is your testament? Have you got
 15024	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tan old testament? Only Paddy was passing there, I tell you what. Then
 15025	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsee him of a Sunday with his little concubine of a wife, and she wagging
 15026	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her, no
 15027	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tless, and her violets, nice as pie, doing the little lady. Jack Mooney’s
 15028	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsister. And the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street
 15029	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcouples. Gob, Jack made him toe the line. Told him if he didn’t patch up
 15030	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe pot, Jesus, he’d kick the shite out of him.
 15031	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15032	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSo Terry brought the three pints.
 15033	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15034	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Here, says Joe, doing the honours. Here, citizen.
 15035	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15036	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Slan leat, says he.
 15037	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15038	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Fortune, Joe, says I. Good health, citizen.
 15039	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15040	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGob, he had his mouth half way down the tumbler already. Want a small
 15041	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfortune to keep him in drinks.
 15042	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15043	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty, Alf? says Joe.
 15044	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15045	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Friend of yours, says Alf.
 15046	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15047	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Nannan? says Joe. The mimber?
 15048	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15049	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I won’t mention any names, says Alf.
 15050	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15051	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I thought so, says Joe. I saw him up at that meeting now with William
 15052	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tField, M. P., the cattle traders.
 15053	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15054	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Hairy Iopas, says the citizen, that exploded volcano, the darling of
 15055	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall countries and the idol of his own.
 15056	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15057	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSo Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease
 15058	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen
 15059	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsending them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his
 15060	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the
 15061	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tguaranteed remedy for timber tongue. Because he was up one time in a
 15062	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknacker’s yard. Walking about with his book and pencil here’s my head
 15063	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand my heels are coming till Joe Cuffe gave him the order of the boot
 15064	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor giving lip to a grazier. Mister Knowall. Teach your grandmother how
 15065	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto milk ducks. Pisser Burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used
 15066	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto be in rivers of tears some times with Mrs O’Dowd crying her eyes out
 15067	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith her eight inches of fat all over her. Couldn’t loosen her farting
 15068	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstrings but old cod’s eye was waltzing around her showing her how to do
 15069	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit. What’s your programme today? Ay. Humane methods. Because the poor
 15070	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanimals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that doesn’t
 15071	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently. Gob,
 15072	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the’d have a soft hand under a hen.
 15073	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15074	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGa Ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Black Liz is our hen. She lays eggs for
 15075	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tus. When she lays her egg she is so glad. Gara. Klook Klook Klook. Then
 15076	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcomes good uncle Leo. He puts his hand under black Liz and takes her
 15077	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfresh egg. Ga ga ga ga Gara. Klook Klook Klook.
 15078	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15079	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Anyhow, says Joe, Field and Nannetti are going over tonight to London
 15080	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto ask about it on the floor of the house of commons.
 15081	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15082	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Are you sure, says Bloom, the councillor is going? I wanted to see him,
 15083	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas it happens.
 15084	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15085	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Well, he’s going off by the mailboat, says Joe, tonight.
 15086	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15087	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That’s too bad, says Bloom. I wanted particularly. Perhaps only Mr
 15088	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tField is going. I couldn’t phone. No. You’re sure?
 15089	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15090	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Nannan’s going too, says Joe. The league told him to ask a question
 15091	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttomorrow about the commissioner of police forbidding Irish games in the
 15092	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpark. What do you think of that, citizen? The Sluagh na h-Eireann.
 15093	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15094	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Cowe Conacre (Multifarnham. Nat.): Arising out of the question of
 15095	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmy honourable friend, the member for Shillelagh, may I ask the right
 15096	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thonourable gentleman whether the government has issued orders that these
 15097	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanimals shall be slaughtered though no medical evidence is forthcoming
 15098	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas to their pathological condition?
 15099	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15100	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Allfours (Tamoshant. Con.): Honourable members are already in
 15101	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpossession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole
 15102	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thouse. I feel I cannot usefully add anything to that. The answer to the
 15103	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thonourable member’s question is in the affirmative.
 15104	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15105	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Orelli O’Reilly (Montenotte. Nat.): Have similar orders been issued
 15106	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor the slaughter of human animals who dare to play Irish games in the
 15107	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPhoenix park?
 15108	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15109	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Allfours: The answer is in the negative.
 15110	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15111	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Cowe Conacre: Has the right honourable gentleman’s famous
 15112	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the Treasury
 15113	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbench? (O! O!)
 15114	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15115	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Allfours: I must have notice of that question.
 15116	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15117	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Staylewit (Buncombe. Ind.): Don’t hesitate to shoot.
 15118	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15119	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t(Ironical opposition cheers.)
 15120	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15121	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe speaker: Order! Order!
 15122	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15123	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t(The house rises. Cheers.)
 15124	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15125	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—There’s the man, says Joe, that made the Gaelic sports revival. There
 15126	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the is sitting there. The man that got away James Stephens. The champion
 15127	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof all Ireland at putting the sixteen pound shot. What was your best
 15128	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthrow, citizen?
 15129	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15130	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Na bacleis, says the citizen, letting on to be modest. There was a time
 15131	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI was as good as the next fellow anyhow.
 15132	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15133	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Put it there, citizen, says Joe. You were and a bloody sight better.
 15134	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15135	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Is that really a fact? says Alf.
 15136	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15137	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, says Bloom. That’s well known. Did you not know that?
 15138	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15139	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSo off they started about Irish sports and shoneen games the like of
 15140	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlawn tennis and about hurley and putting the stone and racy of the soil
 15141	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand building up a nation once again and all to that. And of course Bloom
 15142	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower’s heart violent
 15143	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\texercise was bad. I declare to my antimacassar if you took up a straw
 15144	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom the bloody floor and if you said to Bloom: Look at, Bloom. Do you
 15145	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsee that straw? That’s a straw. Declare to my aunt he’d talk about it
 15146	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor an hour so he would and talk steady.
 15147	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15148	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA most interesting discussion took place in the ancient hall of Brian
 15149	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tO’Ciarnain’s in Sraid na Bretaine Bheag, under the auspices of Sluagh na
 15150	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\th-Eireann, on the revival of ancient Gaelic sports and the importance of
 15151	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tphysical culture, as understood in ancient Greece and ancient Rome
 15152	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand ancient Ireland, for the development of the race. The venerable
 15153	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpresident of the noble order was in the chair and the attendance was
 15154	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof large dimensions. After an instructive discourse by the chairman,
 15155	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta magnificent oration eloquently and forcibly expressed, a most
 15156	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinteresting and instructive discussion of the usual high standard of
 15157	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\texcellence ensued as to the desirability of the revivability of the
 15158	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tancient games and sports of our ancient Panceltic forefathers. The
 15159	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twellknown and highly respected worker in the cause of our old tongue, Mr
 15160	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJoseph M’Carthy Hynes, made an eloquent appeal for the resuscitation of
 15161	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe ancient Gaelic sports and pastimes, practised morning and evening
 15162	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby Finn MacCool, as calculated to revive the best traditions of manly
 15163	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstrength and prowess handed down to us from ancient ages. L. Bloom, who
 15164	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmet with a mixed reception of applause and hisses, having espoused the
 15165	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnegative the vocalist chairman brought the discussion to a close, in
 15166	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tresponse to repeated requests and hearty plaudits from all parts of
 15167	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta bumper house, by a remarkably noteworthy rendering of the immortal
 15168	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThomas Osborne Davis’ evergreen verses (happily too familiar to need
 15169	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trecalling here) A nation once again in the execution of which the
 15170	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tveteran patriot champion may be said without fear of contradiction
 15171	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto have fairly excelled himself. The Irish Caruso-Garibaldi was in
 15172	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuperlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatest
 15173	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tadvantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing
 15174	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit. His superb highclass vocalism, which by its superquality greatly
 15175	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tenhanced his already international reputation, was vociferously
 15176	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tapplauded by the large audience among which were to be noticed many
 15177	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprominent members of the clergy as well as representatives of the press
 15178	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand the bar and the other learned professions. The proceedings then
 15179	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tterminated.
 15180	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15181	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAmongst the clergy present were the very rev. William Delany, S. J., L.
 15182	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tL. D.; the rt rev. Gerald Molloy, D. D.; the rev. P. J. Kavanagh, C. S.
 15183	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSp.; the rev. T. Waters, C. C.; the rev. John M. Ivers, P. P.; the rev.

 15193	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFay, T. Quirke, etc., etc.
 15194	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15195	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Talking about violent exercise, says Alf, were you at that
 15196	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKeogh-Bennett match?
 15197	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15198	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—No, says Joe.
 15199	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15200	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I heard So and So made a cool hundred quid over it, says Alf.
 15201	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15202	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Who? Blazes? says Joe.
 15203	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15204	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd says Bloom:
 15205	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15206	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What I meant about tennis, for example, is the agility and training the
 15207	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\teye.
 15208	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15209	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ay, Blazes, says Alf. He let out that Myler was on the beer to run up
 15210	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe odds and he swatting all the time.
 15211	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15212	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—We know him, says the citizen. The traitor’s son. We know what put
 15213	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEnglish gold in his pocket.
 15214	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15215	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—True for you, says Joe.
 15216	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15217	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the
 15218	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblood, asking Alf:
 15219	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15220	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Now, don’t you think, Bergan?
 15221	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15222	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Myler dusted the floor with him, says Alf. Heenan and Sayers was only
 15223	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta bloody fool to it. Handed him the father and mother of a beating. See
 15224	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe little kipper not up to his navel and the big fellow swiping. God,
 15225	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the gave him one last puck in the wind, Queensberry rules and all, made
 15226	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim puke what he never ate.
 15227	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15228	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIt was a historic and a hefty battle when Myler and Percy were scheduled
 15229	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto don the gloves for the purse of fifty sovereigns. Handicapped as he
 15230	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas by lack of poundage, Dublin’s pet lamb made up for it by superlative
 15231	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tskill in ringcraft. The final bout of fireworks was a gruelling for both
 15232	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchampions. The welterweight sergeantmajor had tapped some lively claret
 15233	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the previous mixup during which Keogh had been receivergeneral of
 15234	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trights and lefts, the artilleryman putting in some neat work on the
 15235	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpet’s nose, and Myler came on looking groggy. The soldier got to
 15236	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbusiness, leading off with a powerful left jab to which the Irish
 15237	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the point of
 15238	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBennett’s jaw. The redcoat ducked but the Dubliner lifted him with a
 15239	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tleft hook, the body punch being a fine one. The men came to handigrips.
 15240	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMyler quickly became busy and got his man under, the bout ending with
 15241	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe bulkier man on the ropes, Myler punishing him. The Englishman, whose
 15242	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tright eye was nearly closed, took his corner where he was liberally
 15243	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdrenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey and brimful of
 15244	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpluck, confident of knocking out the fistic Eblanite in jigtime. It was
 15245	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta fight to a finish and the best man for it. The two fought like tigers
 15246	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand excitement ran fever high. The referee twice cautioned Pucking Percy
 15247	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch.
 15248	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAfter a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of
 15249	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe military man brought blood freely from his opponent’s mouth the
 15250	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to
 15251	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBattling Bennett’s stomach, flooring him flat. It was a knockout clean
 15252	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand clever. Amid tense expectation the Portobello bruiser was being
 15253	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcounted out when Bennett’s second Ole Pfotts Wettstein threw in the
 15254	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttowel and the Santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of
 15255	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with
 15256	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdelight.
 15257	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15258	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—He knows which side his bread is buttered, says Alf. I hear he’s
 15259	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trunning a concert tour now up in the north.
 15260	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15261	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—He is, says Joe. Isn’t he?
 15262	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15263	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Who? says Bloom. Ah, yes. That’s quite true. Yes, a kind of summer
 15264	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttour, you see. Just a holiday.
 15265	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15266	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Mrs B. is the bright particular star, isn’t she? says Joe.
 15267	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15268	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—My wife? says Bloom. She’s singing, yes. I think it will be a success
 15269	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttoo.
 15270	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15271	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe’s an excellent man to organise. Excellent.
 15272	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15273	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHoho begob says I to myself says I. That explains the milk in the
 15274	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcocoanut and absence of hair on the animal’s chest. Blazes doing the
 15275	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttootle on the flute. Concert tour. Dirty Dan the dodger’s son off Island
 15276	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbridge that sold the same horses twice over to the government to fight

 15281	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPride of Calpe’s rocky mount, the ravenhaired daughter of Tweedy. There
 15282	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgrew she to peerless beauty where loquat and almond scent the air. The
 15283	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgardens of Alameda knew her step: the garths of olives knew and bowed.
 15284	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe chaste spouse of Leopold is she: Marion of the bountiful bosoms.
 15285	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15286	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd lo, there entered one of the clan of the O’Molloy’s, a comely hero
 15287	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof white face yet withal somewhat ruddy, his majesty’s counsel learned
 15288	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the law, and with him the prince and heir of the noble line of
 15289	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLambert.
 15290	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15291	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Hello, Ned.
 15292	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15293	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Hello, Alf.
 15294	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15295	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Hello, Jack.
 15296	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15297	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Hello, Joe.
 15298	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15299	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—God save you, says the citizen.
 15300	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15301	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Save you kindly, says J. J. What’ll it be, Ned?
 15302	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15303	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Half one, says Ned.
 15304	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15305	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSo J. J. ordered the drinks.
 15306	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15307	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Were you round at the court? says Joe.
 15308	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15309	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, says J. J. He’ll square that, Ned, says he.
 15310	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15311	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Hope so, says Ned.
 15312	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15313	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNow what were those two at? J. J. getting him off the grand jury list
 15314	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand the other give him a leg over the stile. With his name in Stubbs’s.
 15315	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPlaying cards, hobnobbing with flash toffs with a swank glass in their
 15316	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\teye, adrinking fizz and he half smothered in writs and garnishee orders.
 15317	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPawning his gold watch in Cummins of Francis street where no-one would
 15318	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknow him in the private office when I was there with Pisser releasing
 15319	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this boots out of the pop. What’s your name, sir? Dunne, says he. Ay, and
 15320	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdone says I. Gob, he’ll come home by weeping cross one of those days,
 15321	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI’m thinking.
 15322	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15323	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Did you see that bloody lunatic Breen round there? says Alf. U.P.: up.
 15324	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15325	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, says J. J. Looking for a private detective.
 15326	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15327	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ay, says Ned. And he wanted right go wrong to address the court only
 15328	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCorny Kelleher got round him telling him to get the handwriting examined
 15329	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfirst.
 15330	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15331	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ten thousand pounds, says Alf, laughing. God, I’d give anything to hear
 15332	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim before a judge and jury.
 15333	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15334	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Was it you did it, Alf? says Joe. The truth, the whole truth and
 15335	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnothing but the truth, so help you Jimmy Johnson.
 15336	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15337	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Me? says Alf. Don’t cast your nasturtiums on my character.
 15338	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15339	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Whatever statement you make, says Joe, will be taken down in evidence
 15340	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tagainst you.
 15341	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15342	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Of course an action would lie, says J. J. It implies that he is not
 15343	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcompos mentis. U.P.: up.
 15344	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15345	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Compos your eye! says Alf, laughing. Do you know that he’s balmy? Look
 15346	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat his head. Do you know that some mornings he has to get his hat on
 15347	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith a shoehorn.
 15348	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15349	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, says J. J., but the truth of a libel is no defence to an
 15350	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tindictment for publishing it in the eyes of the law.
 15351	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15352	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ha ha, Alf, says Joe.
 15353	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15354	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Still, says Bloom, on account of the poor woman, I mean his wife.
 15355	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15356	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Pity about her, says the citizen. Or any other woman marries a half and
 15357	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thalf.
 15358	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15359	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—How half and half? says Bloom. Do you mean he...
 15360	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15361	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Half and half I mean, says the citizen. A fellow that’s neither fish
 15362	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnor flesh.
 15363	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15364	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Nor good red herring, says Joe.
 15365	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15366	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That what’s I mean, says the citizen. A pishogue, if you know what that
 15367	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tis.
 15368	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15369	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBegob I saw there was trouble coming. And Bloom explaining he meant on
 15370	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\taccount of it being cruel for the wife having to go round after the
 15371	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\told stuttering fool. Cruelty to animals so it is to let that bloody
 15372	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpovertystricken Breen out on grass with his beard out tripping him,
 15373	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbringing down the rain. And she with her nose cockahoop after she
 15374	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmarried him because a cousin of his old fellow’s was pewopener to the
 15375	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpope. Picture of him on the wall with his Smashall Sweeney’s moustaches,
 15376	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe signior Brini from Summerhill, the eyetallyano, papal Zouave to the
 15377	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHoly Father, has left the quay and gone to Moss street. And who was
 15378	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the, tell us? A nobody, two pair back and passages, at seven shillings a
 15379	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tweek, and he covered with all kinds of breastplates bidding defiance to
 15380	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe world.
 15381	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15382	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And moreover, says J. J., a postcard is publication. It was held to be
 15383	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsufficient evidence of malice in the testcase Sadgrove v. Hole. In my
 15384	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\topinion an action might lie.
 15385	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15386	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSix and eightpence, please. Who wants your opinion? Let us drink our
 15387	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpints in peace. Gob, we won’t be let even do that much itself.
 15388	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15389	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Well, good health, Jack, says Ned.
 15390	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15391	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Good health, Ned, says J. J.
 15392	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15393	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—-There he is again, says Joe.
 15394	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15395	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Where? says Alf.
 15396	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15397	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd begob there he was passing the door with his books under his oxter
 15398	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand the wife beside him and Corny Kelleher with his wall eye looking in
 15399	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas they went past, talking to him like a father, trying to sell him a
 15400	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsecondhand coffin.
 15401	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15402	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—How did that Canada swindle case go off? says Joe.
 15403	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15404	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Remanded, says J. J.
 15405	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15406	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOne of the bottlenosed fraternity it was went by the name of James
 15407	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWought alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro, put an ad in the papers
 15408	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaying he’d give a passage to Canada for twenty bob. What? Do you see
 15409	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tany green in the white of my eye? Course it was a bloody barney. What?
 15410	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSwindled them all, skivvies and badhachs from the county Meath, ay, and
 15411	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this own kidney too. J. J. was telling us there was an ancient Hebrew
 15412	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tZaretsky or something weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him,
 15413	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tswearing by the holy Moses he was stuck for two quid.
 15414	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15415	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Who tried the case? says Joe.
 15416	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15417	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Recorder, says Ned.
 15418	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15419	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Poor old sir Frederick, says Alf, you can cod him up to the two eyes.
 15420	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15421	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Heart as big as a lion, says Ned. Tell him a tale of woe about arrears
 15422	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof rent and a sick wife and a squad of kids and, faith, he’ll dissolve
 15423	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin tears on the bench.
 15424	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15425	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ay, says Alf. Reuben J was bloody lucky he didn’t clap him in the dock
 15426	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe other day for suing poor little Gumley that’s minding stones, for
 15427	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe corporation there near Butt bridge.
 15428	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15429	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd he starts taking off the old recorder letting on to cry:
 15430	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15431	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—A most scandalous thing! This poor hardworking man! How many children?
 15432	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTen, did you say?
 15433	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15434	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, your worship. And my wife has the typhoid.
 15435	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15436	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And the wife with typhoid fever! Scandalous! Leave the court
 15437	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\timmediately, sir. No, sir, I’ll make no order for payment. How dare you,
 15438	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsir, come up before me and ask me to make an order! A poor hardworking
 15439	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tindustrious man! I dismiss the case.
 15440	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15441	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and
 15442	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the third week after the feastday of the Holy and Undivided Trinity,
 15443	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe daughter of the skies, the virgin moon being then in her first
 15444	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tquarter, it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the
 15445	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thalls of law. There master Courtenay, sitting in his own chamber, gave
 15446	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this rede and master Justice Andrews, sitting without a jury in the
 15447	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprobate court, weighed well and pondered the claim of the first
 15448	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and
 15449	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfinal testamentary disposition in re the real and personal estate of the
 15450	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlate lamented Jacob Halliday, vintner, deceased, versus Livingstone, an
 15451	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinfant, of unsound mind, and another. And to the solemn court of Green
 15452	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstreet there came sir Frederick the Falconer. And he sat him there about
 15453	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe hour of five o’clock to administer the law of the brehons at the
 15454	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcommission for all that and those parts to be holden in and for the
 15455	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcounty of the city of Dublin. And there sat with him the high sinhedrim
 15456	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the twelve tribes of Iar, for every tribe one man, of the tribe of
 15457	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPatrick and of the tribe of Hugh and of the tribe of Owen and of the
 15458	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttribe of Conn and of the tribe of Oscar and of the tribe of Fergus and
 15459	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the tribe of Finn and of the tribe of Dermot and of the tribe of
 15460	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCormac and of the tribe of Kevin and of the tribe of Caolte and of the
 15461	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttribe of Ossian, there being in all twelve good men and true. And he
 15462	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconjured them by Him who died on rood that they should well and
 15463	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttruly try and true deliverance make in the issue joined between their
 15464	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and true verdict
 15465	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgive according to the evidence so help them God and kiss the book. And
 15466	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey rose in their seats, those twelve of Iar, and they swore by
 15467	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe name of Him Who is from everlasting that they would do His
 15468	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trightwiseness. And straightway the minions of the law led forth from
 15469	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended
 15470	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin consequence of information received. And they shackled him hand and
 15471	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfoot and would take of him ne bail ne mainprise but preferred a charge
 15472	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tagainst him for he was a malefactor.
 15473	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15474	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Those are nice things, says the citizen, coming over here to Ireland
 15475	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfilling the country with bugs.
 15476	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15477	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSo Bloom lets on he heard nothing and he starts talking with Joe,
 15478	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttelling him he needn’t trouble about that little matter till the first
 15479	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbut if he would just say a word to Mr Crawford. And so Joe swore high
 15480	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand holy by this and by that he’d do the devil and all.
 15481	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15482	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Because, you see, says Bloom, for an advertisement you must have
 15483	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trepetition. That’s the whole secret.
 15484	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15485	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Rely on me, says Joe.
 15486	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15487	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Swindling the peasants, says the citizen, and the poor of Ireland. We
 15488	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twant no more strangers in our house.
 15489	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15490	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O, I’m sure that will be all right, Hynes, says Bloom. It’s just that
 15491	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKeyes, you see.
 15492	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15493	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Consider that done, says Joe.
 15494	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15495	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Very kind of you, says Bloom.
 15496	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15497	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The strangers, says the citizen. Our own fault. We let them come in.
 15498	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWe brought them in. The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon
 15499	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trobbers here.
 15500	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15501	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Decree nisi, says J. J.
 15502	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15503	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing, a
 15504	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspider’s web in the corner behind the barrel, and the citizen scowling
 15505	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tafter him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite and
 15506	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhen.
 15507	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15508	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—A dishonoured wife, says the citizen, that’s what’s the cause of all
 15509	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tour misfortunes.
 15510	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15511	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And here she is, says Alf, that was giggling over the Police Gazette
 15512	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith Terry on the counter, in all her warpaint.
 15513	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15514	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Give us a squint at her, says I.
 15515	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15516	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd what was it only one of the smutty yankee pictures Terry borrows off
 15517	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof Corny Kelleher. Secrets for enlarging your private parts. Misconduct
 15518	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof society belle. Norman W. Tupper, wealthy Chicago contractor, finds
 15519	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpretty but faithless wife in lap of officer Taylor. Belle in her
 15520	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbloomers misconducting herself, and her fancyman feeling for her tickles
 15521	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand Norman W. Tupper bouncing in with his peashooter just in time to be
 15522	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlate after she doing the trick of the loop with officer Taylor.
 15523	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15524	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O jakers, Jenny, says Joe, how short your shirt is!
 15525	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15526	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—There’s hair, Joe, says I. Get a queer old tailend of corned beef off
 15527	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof that one, what?
 15528	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15529	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSo anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on
 15530	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim as long as a late breakfast.
 15531	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15532	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Well, says the citizen, what’s the latest from the scene of action?
 15533	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhat did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide
 15534	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabout the Irish language?
 15535	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15536	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tO’Nolan, clad in shining armour, low bending made obeisance to the
 15537	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpuissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of
 15538	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat which had befallen, how that the grave elders of the most obedient
 15539	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcity, second of the realm, had met them in the tholsel, and there, after
 15540	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdue prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal, had taken solemn
 15541	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcounsel whereby they might, if so be it might be, bring once more into
 15542	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thonour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided Gael.
 15543	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15544	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—It’s on the march, says the citizen. To hell with the bloody brutal
 15545	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSassenachs and their patois.
 15546	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15547	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSo J. J. puts in a word, doing the toff about one story was good till
 15548	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou heard another and blinking facts and the Nelson policy, putting your
 15549	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to impeach
 15550	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta nation, and Bloom trying to back him up moderation and botheration and
 15551	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir colonies and their civilisation.
 15552	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15553	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Their syphilisation, you mean, says the citizen. To hell with them! The
 15554	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcurse of a goodfornothing God light sideways on the bloody thicklugged
 15555	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsons of whores’ gets! No music and no art and no literature worthy of
 15556	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe name. Any civilisation they have they stole from us. Tonguetied sons
 15557	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof bastards’ ghosts.
 15558	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15559	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The European family, says J. J....
 15560	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15561	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—They’re not European, says the citizen. I was in Europe with Kevin Egan
 15562	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof Paris. You wouldn’t see a trace of them or their language anywhere in
 15563	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEurope except in a cabinet d’aisance.
 15564	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15565	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd says John Wyse:
 15566	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15567	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Full many a flower is born to blush unseen.
 15568	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15569	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo:
 15570	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15571	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Conspuez les Anglais! Perfide Albion!
 15572	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15573	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe said and then lifted he in his rude great brawny strengthy hands the
 15574	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmedher of dark strong foamy ale and, uttering his tribal slogan Lamh
 15575	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDearg Abu, he drank to the undoing of his foes, a race of mighty
 15576	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvalorous heroes, rulers of the waves, who sit on thrones of alabaster
 15577	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsilent as the deathless gods.
 15578	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15579	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What’s up with you, says I to Lenehan. You look like a fellow that had
 15580	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlost a bob and found a tanner.
 15581	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15582	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Gold cup, says he.
 15583	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15584	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Who won, Mr Lenehan? says Terry.
 15585	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15586	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Throwaway, says he, at twenty to one. A rank outsider. And the rest
 15587	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnowhere.
 15588	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15589	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And Bass’s mare? says Terry.
 15590	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15591	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Still running, says he. We’re all in a cart. Boylan plunged two quid on
 15592	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmy tip Sceptre for himself and a lady friend.
 15593	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15594	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I had half a crown myself, says Terry, on Zinfandel that Mr Flynn gave
 15595	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tme. Lord Howard de Walden’s.
 15596	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15597	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Twenty to one, says Lenehan. Such is life in an outhouse. Throwaway,
 15598	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsays he. Takes the biscuit, and talking about bunions. Frailty, thy name
 15599	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tis Sceptre.
 15600	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15601	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSo he went over to the biscuit tin Bob Doran left to see if there was
 15602	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanything he could lift on the nod, the old cur after him backing his
 15603	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tluck with his mangy snout up. Old Mother Hubbard went to the cupboard.
 15604	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15605	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Not there, my child, says he.
 15606	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15607	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Keep your pecker up, says Joe. She’d have won the money only for the
 15608	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tother dog.
 15609	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15610	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd J. J. and the citizen arguing about law and history with Bloom
 15611	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsticking in an odd word.
 15612	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15613	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Some people, says Bloom, can see the mote in others’ eyes but they
 15614	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcan’t see the beam in their own.
 15615	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15616	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Raimeis, says the citizen. There’s no-one as blind as the fellow that
 15617	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twon’t see, if you know what that means. Where are our missing twenty
 15618	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmillions of Irish should be here today instead of four, our lost tribes?
 15619	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd our potteries and textiles, the finest in the whole world! And our
 15620	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twool that was sold in Rome in the time of Juvenal and our flax and our
 15621	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdamask from the looms of Antrim and our Limerick lace, our tanneries and
 15622	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tour white flint glass down there by Ballybough and our Huguenot poplin
 15623	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat we have since Jacquard de Lyon and our woven silk and our Foxford
 15624	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttweeds and ivory raised point from the Carmelite convent in New Ross,
 15625	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnothing like it in the whole wide world. Where are the Greek merchants
 15626	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat came through the pillars of Hercules, the Gibraltar now grabbed by
 15627	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe foe of mankind, with gold and Tyrian purple to sell in Wexford at
 15628	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe fair of Carmen? Read Tacitus and Ptolemy, even Giraldus Cambrensis.
 15629	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWine, peltries, Connemara marble, silver from Tipperary, second to none,
 15630	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tour farfamed horses even today, the Irish hobbies, with king Philip
 15631	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof Spain offering to pay customs duties for the right to fish in our
 15632	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twaters. What do the yellowjohns of Anglia owe us for our ruined trade
 15633	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand our ruined hearths? And the beds of the Barrow and Shannon they
 15634	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twon’t deepen with millions of acres of marsh and bog to make us all die
 15635	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof consumption?
 15636	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15637	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—As treeless as Portugal we’ll be soon, says John Wyse, or Heligoland
 15638	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith its one tree if something is not done to reafforest the land.
 15639	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLarches, firs, all the trees of the conifer family are going fast. I was
 15640	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\treading a report of lord Castletown’s...
 15641	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15642	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Save them, says the citizen, the giant ash of Galway and the chieftain
 15643	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\telm of Kildare with a fortyfoot bole and an acre of foliage. Save the
 15644	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttrees of Ireland for the future men of Ireland on the fair hills of
 15645	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEire, O.
 15646	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15647	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Europe has its eyes on you, says Lenehan.
 15648	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15649	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe fashionable international world attended en masse this afternoon
 15650	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat the wedding of the chevalier Jean Wyse de Neaulan, grand high chief
 15651	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tranger of the Irish National Foresters, with Miss Fir Conifer of Pine
 15652	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tValley. Lady Sylvester Elmshade, Mrs Barbara Lovebirch, Mrs Poll Ash,
 15653	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMrs Holly Hazeleyes, Miss Daphne Bays, Miss Dorothy Canebrake, Mrs Clyde
 15654	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTwelvetrees, Mrs Rowan Greene, Mrs Helen Vinegadding, Miss Virginia
 15655	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCreeper, Miss Gladys Beech, Miss Olive Garth, Miss Blanche Maple, Mrs
 15656	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMaud Mahogany, Miss Myra Myrtle, Miss Priscilla Elderflower, Miss
 15657	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBee Honeysuckle, Miss Grace Poplar, Miss O Mimosa San, Miss Rachel
 15658	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCedarfrond, the Misses Lilian and Viola Lilac, Miss Timidity Aspenall,
 15659	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMrs Kitty Dewey-Mosse, Miss May Hawthorne, Mrs Gloriana Palme, Mrs Liana
 15660	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tForrest, Mrs Arabella Blackwood and Mrs Norma Holyoake of Oakholme Regis
 15661	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgraced the ceremony by their presence. The bride who was given away by
 15662	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther father, the M’Conifer of the Glands, looked exquisitely charming in
 15663	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta creation carried out in green mercerised silk, moulded on an underslip
 15664	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof gloaming grey, sashed with a yoke of broad emerald and finished with
 15665	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta triple flounce of darkerhued fringe, the scheme being relieved by
 15666	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbretelles and hip insertions of acorn bronze. The maids of honour, Miss
 15667	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLarch Conifer and Miss Spruce Conifer, sisters of the bride, wore very
 15668	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbecoming costumes in the same tone, a dainty motif of plume rose being
 15669	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tworked into the pleats in a pinstripe and repeated capriciously in the
 15670	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjadegreen toques in the form of heron feathers of paletinted coral.
 15671	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSenhor Enrique Flor presided at the organ with his wellknown ability
 15672	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand, in addition to the prescribed numbers of the nuptial mass, played
 15673	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta new and striking arrangement of Woodman, spare that tree at the
 15674	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconclusion of the service. On leaving the church of Saint Fiacre in
 15675	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHorto after the papal blessing the happy pair were subjected to a
 15676	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplayful crossfire of hazelnuts, beechmast, bayleaves, catkins of willow,
 15677	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tivytod, hollyberries, mistletoe sprigs and quicken shoots. Mr and Mrs
 15678	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWyse Conifer Neaulan will spend a quiet honeymoon in the Black Forest.
 15679	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15680	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And our eyes are on Europe, says the citizen. We had our trade with
 15681	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSpain and the French and with the Flemings before those mongrels were
 15682	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpupped, Spanish ale in Galway, the winebark on the winedark waterway.
 15683	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15684	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And will again, says Joe.
 15685	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15686	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And with the help of the holy mother of God we will again, says the
 15687	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcitizen, clapping his thigh. Our harbours that are empty will be full
 15688	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tagain, Queenstown, Kinsale, Galway, Blacksod Bay, Ventry in the kingdom
 15689	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof Kerry, Killybegs, the third largest harbour in the wide world with
 15690	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta fleet of masts of the Galway Lynches and the Cavan O’Reillys and the
 15691	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tO’Kennedys of Dublin when the earl of Desmond could make a treaty with
 15692	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe emperor Charles the Fifth himself. And will again, says he, when the
 15693	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfirst Irish battleship is seen breasting the waves with our own flag to
 15694	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe fore, none of your Henry Tudor’s harps, no, the oldest flag afloat,
 15695	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe flag of the province of Desmond and Thomond, three crowns on a blue
 15696	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfield, the three sons of Milesius.
 15697	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15698	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd he took the last swig out of the pint. Moya. All wind and piss like
 15699	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta tanyard cat. Cows in Connacht have long horns. As much as his bloody
 15700	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlife is worth to go down and address his tall talk to the assembled
 15701	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmultitude in Shanagolden where he daren’t show his nose with the Molly
 15702	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMaguires looking for him to let daylight through him for grabbing the
 15703	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tholding of an evicted tenant.
 15704	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15705	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Hear, hear to that, says John Wyse. What will you have?
 15706	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15707	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—An imperial yeomanry, says Lenehan, to celebrate the occasion.
 15708	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15709	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Half one, Terry, says John Wyse, and a hands up. Terry! Are you asleep?
 15710	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15711	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, sir, says Terry. Small whisky and bottle of Allsop. Right, sir.
 15712	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15713	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHanging over the bloody paper with Alf looking for spicy bits instead of
 15714	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tattending to the general public. Picture of a butting match, trying to
 15715	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcrack their bloody skulls, one chap going for the other with his head
 15716	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdown like a bull at a gate. And another one: Black Beast Burned in
 15717	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOmaha, Ga. A lot of Deadwood Dicks in slouch hats and they firing at a
 15718	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSambo strung up in a tree with his tongue out and a bonfire under
 15719	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim. Gob, they ought to drown him in the sea after and electrocute and
 15720	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcrucify him to make sure of their job.
 15721	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15722	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—But what about the fighting navy, says Ned, that keeps our foes at bay?
 15723	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15724	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I’ll tell you what about it, says the citizen. Hell upon earth it is.
 15725	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRead the revelations that’s going on in the papers about flogging on
 15726	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe training ships at Portsmouth. A fellow writes that calls himself
 15727	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDisgusted One.
 15728	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15729	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSo he starts telling us about corporal punishment and about the crew
 15730	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof tars and officers and rearadmirals drawn up in cocked hats and the
 15731	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tparson with his protestant bible to witness punishment and a young lad
 15732	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrought out, howling for his ma, and they tie him down on the buttend of
 15733	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta gun.
 15734	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15735	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—A rump and dozen, says the citizen, was what that old ruffian sir John
 15736	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBeresford called it but the modern God’s Englishman calls it caning on
 15737	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe breech.
 15738	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15739	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd says John Wyse:
 15740	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15741	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—‘Tis a custom more honoured in the breach than in the observance.
 15742	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15743	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThen he was telling us the master at arms comes along with a long cane
 15744	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand he draws out and he flogs the bloody backside off of the poor lad
 15745	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttill he yells meila murder.
 15746	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15747	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That’s your glorious British navy, says the citizen, that bosses the
 15748	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tearth. The fellows that never will be slaves, with the only hereditary
 15749	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchamber on the face of God’s earth and their land in the hands of a
 15750	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdozen gamehogs and cottonball barons. That’s the great empire they boast
 15751	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabout of drudges and whipped serfs.
 15752	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15753	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—On which the sun never rises, says Joe.
 15754	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15755	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And the tragedy of it is, says the citizen, they believe it. The
 15756	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunfortunate yahoos believe it.
 15757	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15758	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey believe in rod, the scourger almighty, creator of hell upon earth,
 15759	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand in Jacky Tar, the son of a gun, who was conceived of unholy boast,
 15760	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tborn of the fighting navy, suffered under rump and dozen, was scarified,
 15761	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tflayed and curried, yelled like bloody hell, the third day he arose
 15762	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tagain from the bed, steered into haven, sitteth on his beamend till
 15763	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfurther orders whence he shall come to drudge for a living and be paid.
 15764	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15765	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—But, says Bloom, isn’t discipline the same everywhere. I mean wouldn’t
 15766	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit be the same here if you put force against force?
 15767	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15768	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDidn’t I tell you? As true as I’m drinking this porter if he was at his
 15769	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlast gasp he’d try to downface you that dying was living.
 15770	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15771	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—We’ll put force against force, says the citizen. We have our greater
 15772	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIreland beyond the sea. They were driven out of house and home in the
 15773	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblack 47. Their mudcabins and their shielings by the roadside were laid
 15774	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlow by the batteringram and the Times rubbed its hands and told the
 15775	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhitelivered Saxons there would soon be as few Irish in Ireland as
 15776	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tredskins in America. Even the Grand Turk sent us his piastres. But the
 15777	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSassenach tried to starve the nation at home while the land was full
 15778	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof crops that the British hyenas bought and sold in Rio de Janeiro. Ay,
 15779	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey drove out the peasants in hordes. Twenty thousand of them died in
 15780	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe coffinships. But those that came to the land of the free remember
 15781	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe land of bondage. And they will come again and with a vengeance, no
 15782	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcravens, the sons of Granuaile, the champions of Kathleen ni Houlihan.
 15783	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15784	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Perfectly true, says Bloom. But my point was...
 15785	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15786	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—We are a long time waiting for that day, citizen, says Ned. Since the
 15787	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpoor old woman told us that the French were on the sea and landed at
 15788	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKillala.
 15789	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15790	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ay, says John Wyse. We fought for the royal Stuarts that reneged us
 15791	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tagainst the Williamites and they betrayed us. Remember Limerick and the
 15792	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbroken treatystone. We gave our best blood to France and Spain, the
 15793	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twild geese. Fontenoy, eh? And Sarsfield and O’Donnell, duke of Tetuan
 15794	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin Spain, and Ulysses Browne of Camus that was fieldmarshal to Maria
 15795	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTeresa. But what did we ever get for it?
 15796	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15797	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The French! says the citizen. Set of dancing masters! Do you know what
 15798	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit is? They were never worth a roasted fart to Ireland. Aren’t they
 15799	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttrying to make an Entente cordiale now at Tay Pay’s dinnerparty with
 15800	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tperfidious Albion? Firebrands of Europe and they always were.
 15801	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15802	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Conspuez les Français, says Lenehan, nobbling his beer.
 15803	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15804	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians, says Joe, haven’t we
 15805	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George the
 15806	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\telector down to the German lad and the flatulent old bitch that’s dead?
 15807	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15808	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJesus, I had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old one
 15809	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith the winkers on her, blind drunk in her royal palace every night of
 15810	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGod, old Vic, with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman carting
 15811	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the
 15812	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhiskers and singing him old bits of songs about Ehren on the Rhine and
 15813	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcome where the boose is cheaper.
 15814	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15815	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Well, says J. J. We have Edward the peacemaker now.
 15816	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15817	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Tell that to a fool, says the citizen. There’s a bloody sight more pox
 15818	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthan pax about that boyo. Edward Guelph-Wettin!
 15819	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15820	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And what do you think, says Joe, of the holy boys, the priests
 15821	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand bishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in His Satanic
 15822	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMajesty’s racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his
 15823	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjockeys rode. The earl of Dublin, no less.
 15824	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15825	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself, says little
 15826	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAlf.
 15827	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15828	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd says J. J.:
 15829	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15830	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Considerations of space influenced their lordships’ decision.
 15831	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15832	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Will you try another, citizen? says Joe.
 15833	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15834	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, sir, says he. I will.
 15835	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15836	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You? says Joe.
 15837	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15838	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Beholden to you, Joe, says I. May your shadow never grow less.
 15839	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15840	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Repeat that dose, says Joe.
 15841	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15842	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited with
 15843	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling about.
 15844	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15845	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Persecution, says he, all the history of the world is full of it.
 15846	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPerpetuating national hatred among nations.
 15847	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15848	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—But do you know what a nation means? says John Wyse.
 15849	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15850	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, says Bloom.
 15851	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15852	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What is it? says John Wyse.
 15853	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15854	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—A nation? says Bloom. A nation is the same people living in the same
 15855	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplace.
 15856	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15857	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—By God, then, says Ned, laughing, if that’s so I’m a nation for I’m
 15858	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tliving in the same place for the past five years.
 15859	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15860	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSo of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he, trying to muck
 15861	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout of it:
 15862	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15863	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Or also living in different places.
 15864	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15865	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That covers my case, says Joe.
 15866	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15867	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What is your nation if I may ask? says the citizen.
 15868	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15869	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ireland, says Bloom. I was born here. Ireland.
 15870	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15871	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and,
 15872	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgob, he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner.
 15873	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15874	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—After you with the push, Joe, says he, taking out his handkerchief to
 15875	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tswab himself dry.
 15876	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15877	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Here you are, citizen, says Joe. Take that in your right hand and
 15878	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trepeat after me the following words.
 15879	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15880	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe muchtreasured and intricately embroidered ancient Irish facecloth
 15881	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tattributed to Solomon of Droma and Manus Tomaltach og MacDonogh, authors
 15882	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the Book of Ballymote, was then carefully produced and called forth
 15883	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprolonged admiration. No need to dwell on the legendary beauty of the
 15884	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcornerpieces, the acme of art, wherein one can distinctly discern each
 15885	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the four evangelists in turn presenting to each of the four masters
 15886	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this evangelical symbol, a bogoak sceptre, a North American puma (a far
 15887	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnobler king of beasts than the British article, be it said in passing),
 15888	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta Kerry calf and a golden eagle from Carrantuohill. The scenes depicted
 15889	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton the emunctory field, showing our ancient duns and raths and cromlechs
 15890	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones, are as
 15891	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when the Sligo
 15892	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tilluminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy long long ago in
 15893	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe time of the Barmecides. Glendalough, the lovely lakes of Killarney,
 15894	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe ruins of Clonmacnois, Cong Abbey, Glen Inagh and the Twelve Pins,
 15895	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIreland’s Eye, the Green Hills of Tallaght, Croagh Patrick, the brewery
 15896	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof Messrs Arthur Guinness, Son and Company (Limited), Lough Neagh’s
 15897	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbanks, the vale of Ovoca, Isolde’s tower, the Mapas obelisk, Sir Patrick

 15903	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWellington, the rock of Cashel, the bog of Allen, the Henry Street
 15904	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWarehouse, Fingal’s Cave—all these moving scenes are still there for us
 15905	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttoday rendered more beautiful still by the waters of sorrow which have
 15906	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpassed over them and by the rich incrustations of time.
 15907	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15908	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Show us over the drink, says I. Which is which?
 15909	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15910	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That’s mine, says Joe, as the devil said to the dead policeman.
 15911	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15912	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And I belong to a race too, says Bloom, that is hated and persecuted.
 15913	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAlso now. This very moment. This very instant.
 15914	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15915	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGob, he near burnt his fingers with the butt of his old cigar.
 15916	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15917	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Robbed, says he. Plundered. Insulted. Persecuted. Taking what belongs
 15918	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto us by right. At this very moment, says he, putting up his fist, sold
 15919	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby auction in Morocco like slaves or cattle.
 15920	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15921	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Are you talking about the new Jerusalem? says the citizen.
 15922	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15923	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I’m talking about injustice, says Bloom.
 15924	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15925	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Right, says John Wyse. Stand up to it then with force like men.
 15926	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15927	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThat’s an almanac picture for you. Mark for a softnosed bullet. Old
 15928	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlardyface standing up to the business end of a gun. Gob, he’d adorn a
 15929	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsweepingbrush, so he would, if he only had a nurse’s apron on him. And
 15930	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthen he collapses all of a sudden, twisting around all the opposite, as
 15931	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlimp as a wet rag.
 15932	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15933	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—But it’s no use, says he. Force, hatred, history, all that. That’s not
 15934	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlife for men and women, insult and hatred. And everybody knows that it’s
 15935	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe very opposite of that that is really life.
 15936	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15937	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What? says Alf.
 15938	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15939	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Love, says Bloom. I mean the opposite of hatred. I must go now, says
 15940	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the to John Wyse. Just round to the court a moment to see if Martin is
 15941	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthere. If he comes just say I’ll be back in a second. Just a moment.
 15942	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15943	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWho’s hindering you? And off he pops like greased lightning.
 15944	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15945	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—A new apostle to the gentiles, says the citizen. Universal love.
 15946	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15947	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Well, says John Wyse. Isn’t that what we’re told. Love your neighbour.
 15948	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15949	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That chap? says the citizen. Beggar my neighbour is his motto. Love,
 15950	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmoya! He’s a nice pattern of a Romeo and Juliet.
 15951	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15952	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLove loves to love love. Nurse loves the new chemist. Constable 14A
 15953	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tloves Mary Kelly. Gerty MacDowell loves the boy that has the bicycle. M.
 15954	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tB. loves a fair gentleman. Li Chi Han lovey up kissy Cha Pu Chow. Jumbo,
 15955	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe elephant, loves Alice, the elephant. Old Mr Verschoyle with the ear
 15956	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttrumpet loves old Mrs Verschoyle with the turnedin eye. The man in the
 15957	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrown macintosh loves a lady who is dead. His Majesty the King loves Her
 15958	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMajesty the Queen. Mrs Norman W. Tupper loves officer Taylor. You love
 15959	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta certain person. And this person loves that other person because
 15960	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\teverybody loves somebody but God loves everybody.
 15961	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15962	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Well, Joe, says I, your very good health and song. More power, citizen.
 15963	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15964	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Hurrah, there, says Joe.
 15965	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15966	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The blessing of God and Mary and Patrick on you, says the citizen.
 15967	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15968	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd he ups with his pint to wet his whistle.
 15969	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15970	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—We know those canters, says he, preaching and picking your pocket. What
 15971	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabout sanctimonious Cromwell and his ironsides that put the women and
 15972	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchildren of Drogheda to the sword with the bible text God is love pasted
 15973	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tround the mouth of his cannon? The bible! Did you read that skit in the
 15974	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tUnited Irishman today about that Zulu chief that’s visiting England?
 15975	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15976	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What’s that? says Joe.
 15977	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15978	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSo the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts
 15979	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\treading out:
 15980	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 15981	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presented
 15982	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyesterday to His Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in Waiting,
 15983	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLord Walkup of Walkup on Eggs, to tender to His Majesty the heartfelt
 15984	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthanks of British traders for the facilities afforded them in his
 15985	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdominions. The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which
 15986	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe dusky potentate, in the course of a happy speech, freely translated
 15987	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby the British chaplain, the reverend Ananias Praisegod Barebones,
 15988	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and emphasised the cordial
 15989	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trelations existing between Abeakuta and the British empire, stating that
 15990	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible,
 15991	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe volume of the word of God and the secret of England’s greatness,
 15992	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgraciously presented to him by the white chief woman, the great squaw
 15993	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tVictoria, with a personal dedication from the august hand of the Royal
 15994	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDonor. The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the
 15995	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttoast Black and White from the skull of his immediate predecessor in the
 15996	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdynasty Kakachakachak, surnamed Forty Warts, after which he visited the
 15997	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchief factory of Cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors’ book,
 15998	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsubsequently executing a charming old Abeakutic wardance, in the course
 15999	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof which he swallowed several knives and forks, amid hilarious applause
 16000	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom the girl hands.
 16001	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16002	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Widow woman, says Ned. I wouldn’t doubt her. Wonder did he put that
 16003	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbible to the same use as I would.
 16004	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16005	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Same only more so, says Lenehan. And thereafter in that fruitful land
 16006	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly.
 16007	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16008	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Is that by Griffith? says John Wyse.
 16009	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16010	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—No, says the citizen. It’s not signed Shanganagh. It’s only initialled:
 16011	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tP.
 16012	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16013	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And a very good initial too, says Joe.
 16014	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16015	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That’s how it’s worked, says the citizen. Trade follows the flag.
 16016	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16017	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Well, says J. J., if they’re any worse than those Belgians in the Congo
 16018	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFree State they must be bad. Did you read that report by a man what’s
 16019	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthis his name is?
 16020	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16021	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Casement, says the citizen. He’s an Irishman.
 16022	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16023	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, that’s the man, says J. J. Raping the women and girls and flogging
 16024	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they can out of
 16025	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem.
 16026	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16027	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I know where he’s gone, says Lenehan, cracking his fingers.
 16028	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16029	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Who? says I.
 16030	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16031	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Bloom, says he. The courthouse is a blind. He had a few bob on
 16032	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThrowaway and he’s gone to gather in the shekels.
 16033	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16034	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Is it that whiteeyed kaffir? says the citizen, that never backed a
 16035	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thorse in anger in his life?
 16036	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16037	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That’s where he’s gone, says Lenehan. I met Bantam Lyons going to back
 16038	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip.
 16039	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on. He’s the
 16040	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tonly man in Dublin has it. A dark horse.
 16041	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16042	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—He’s a bloody dark horse himself, says Joe.
 16043	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16044	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Mind, Joe, says I. Show us the entrance out.
 16045	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16046	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—There you are, says Terry.
 16047	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16048	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGoodbye Ireland I’m going to Gort. So I just went round the back of
 16049	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe yard to pumpship and begob (hundred shillings to five) while I was
 16050	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tletting off my (Throwaway twenty to) letting off my load gob says I
 16051	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto myself I knew he was uneasy in his (two pints off of Joe and one in
 16052	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSlattery’s off) in his mind to get off the mark to (hundred shillings
 16053	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tis five quid) and when they were in the (dark horse) pisser Burke was
 16054	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttelling me card party and letting on the child was sick (gob, must have
 16055	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdone about a gallon) flabbyarse of a wife speaking down the tube she’s
 16056	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbetter or she’s (ow!) all a plan so he could vamoose with the pool if he
 16057	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twon or (Jesus, full up I was) trading without a licence (ow!) Ireland my
 16058	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnation says he (hoik! phthook!) never be up to those bloody (there’s the
 16059	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlast of it) Jerusalem (ah!) cuckoos.
 16060	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16061	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSo anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong, John Wyse saying it
 16062	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper
 16063	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall kinds of jerrymandering, packed juries and swindling the taxes off
 16064	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk
 16065	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabout selling Irish industries. Robbing Peter to pay Paul. Gob, that
 16066	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tputs the bloody kybosh on it if old sloppy eyes is mucking up the show.
 16067	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGive us a bloody chance. God save Ireland from the likes of that bloody
 16068	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmouseabout. Mr Bloom with his argol bargol. And his old fellow before
 16069	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim perpetrating frauds, old Methusalem Bloom, the robbing bagman, that
 16070	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpoisoned himself with the prussic acid after he swamping the country
 16071	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith his baubles and his penny diamonds. Loans by post on easy terms.
 16072	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAny amount of money advanced on note of hand. Distance no object. No
 16073	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsecurity. Gob, he’s like Lanty MacHale’s goat that’d go a piece of the
 16074	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\troad with every one.
 16075	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16076	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Well, it’s a fact, says John Wyse. And there’s the man now that’ll tell
 16077	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou all about it, Martin Cunningham.
 16078	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16079	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power
 16080	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton, pensioner out of
 16081	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe collector general’s, an orangeman Blackburn does have on the
 16082	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tregistration and he drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the
 16083	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcountry at the king’s expense.
 16084	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16085	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOur travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their
 16086	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpalfreys.
 16087	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16088	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ho, varlet! cried he, who by his mien seemed the leader of the party.
 16089	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSaucy knave! To us!
 16090	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16091	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSo saying he knocked loudly with his swordhilt upon the open lattice.
 16092	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16093	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMine host came forth at the summons, girding him with his tabard.
 16094	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16095	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Give you good den, my masters, said he with an obsequious bow.
 16096	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16097	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Bestir thyself, sirrah! cried he who had knocked. Look to our steeds.
 16098	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it.
 16099	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16100	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Lackaday, good masters, said the host, my poor house has but a bare
 16101	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlarder. I know not what to offer your lordships.
 16102	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16103	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—How now, fellow? cried the second of the party, a man of pleasant
 16104	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcountenance, So servest thou the king’s messengers, master Taptun?
 16105	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16106	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAn instantaneous change overspread the landlord’s visage.
 16107	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16108	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Cry you mercy, gentlemen, he said humbly. An you be the king’s
 16109	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmessengers (God shield His Majesty!) you shall not want for aught. The
 16110	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tking’s friends (God bless His Majesty!) shall not go afasting in my
 16111	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thouse I warrant me.
 16112	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16113	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Then about! cried the traveller who had not spoken, a lusty trencherman
 16114	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby his aspect. Hast aught to give us?
 16115	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16116	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMine host bowed again as he made answer:
 16117	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16118	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What say you, good masters, to a squab pigeon pasty, some collops of
 16119	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvenison, a saddle of veal, widgeon with crisp hog’s bacon, a boar’s head
 16120	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith pistachios, a bason of jolly custard, a medlar tansy and a flagon
 16121	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof old Rhenish?
 16122	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16123	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Gadzooks! cried the last speaker. That likes me well. Pistachios!
 16124	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16125	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Aha! cried he of the pleasant countenance. A poor house and a bare
 16126	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlarder, quotha! ‘Tis a merry rogue.
 16127	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16128	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSo in comes Martin asking where was Bloom.
 16129	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16130	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Where is he? says Lenehan. Defrauding widows and orphans.
 16131	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16132	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Isn’t that a fact, says John Wyse, what I was telling the citizen about
 16133	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBloom and the Sinn Fein?
 16134	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16135	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That’s so, says Martin. Or so they allege.
 16136	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16137	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Who made those allegations? says Alf.
 16138	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16139	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I, says Joe. I’m the alligator.
 16140	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16141	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And after all, says John Wyse, why can’t a jew love his country like
 16142	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe next fellow?
 16143	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16144	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Why not? says J. J., when he’s quite sure which country it is.
 16145	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16146	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Is he a jew or a gentile or a holy Roman or a swaddler or what the hell
 16147	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tis he? says Ned. Or who is he? No offence, Crofton.
 16148	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16149	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Who is Junius? says J. J.
 16150	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16151	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—We don’t want him, says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian.
 16152	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16153	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—He’s a perverted jew, says Martin, from a place in Hungary and it was
 16154	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system. We know that
 16155	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the castle.
 16156	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16157	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Isn’t he a cousin of Bloom the dentist? says Jack Power.
 16158	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16159	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Not at all, says Martin. Only namesakes. His name was Virag, the
 16160	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfather’s name that poisoned himself. He changed it by deedpoll, the
 16161	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfather did.
 16162	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16163	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That’s the new Messiah for Ireland! says the citizen. Island of saints
 16164	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand sages!
 16165	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16166	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Well, they’re still waiting for their redeemer, says Martin. For that
 16167	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmatter so are we.
 16168	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16169	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, says J. J., and every male that’s born they think it may be their
 16170	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMessiah. And every jew is in a tall state of excitement, I believe, till
 16171	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the knows if he’s a father or a mother.
 16172	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16173	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Expecting every moment will be his next, says Lenehan.
 16174	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16175	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O, by God, says Ned, you should have seen Bloom before that son of his
 16176	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat died was born. I met him one day in the south city markets buying a
 16177	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttin of Neave’s food six weeks before the wife was delivered.
 16178	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16179	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—En ventre sa mère, says J. J.
 16180	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16181	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Do you call that a man? says the citizen.
 16182	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16183	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I wonder did he ever put it out of sight, says Joe.
 16184	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16185	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Well, there were two children born anyhow, says Jack Power.
 16186	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16187	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And who does he suspect? says the citizen.
 16188	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16189	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGob, there’s many a true word spoken in jest. One of those mixed
 16190	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmiddlings he is. Lying up in the hotel Pisser was telling me once a
 16191	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmonth with headache like a totty with her courses. Do you know what I’m
 16192	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttelling you? It’d be an act of God to take a hold of a fellow the like
 16193	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof that and throw him in the bloody sea. Justifiable homicide, so it
 16194	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould. Then sloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint of
 16195	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstuff like a man. Give us your blessing. Not as much as would blind your
 16196	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\teye.
 16197	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16198	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Charity to the neighbour, says Martin. But where is he? We can’t wait.
 16199	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16200	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—A wolf in sheep’s clothing, says the citizen. That’s what he is. Virag
 16201	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom Hungary! Ahasuerus I call him. Cursed by God.
 16202	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16203	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Have you time for a brief libation, Martin? says Ned.
 16204	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16205	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Only one, says Martin. We must be quick. J. J. and S.
 16206	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16207	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You, Jack? Crofton? Three half ones, Terry.
 16208	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16209	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Saint Patrick would want to land again at Ballykinlar and convert us,
 16210	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsays the citizen, after allowing things like that to contaminate our
 16211	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshores.
 16212	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16213	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Well, says Martin, rapping for his glass. God bless all here is my
 16214	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprayer.
 16215	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16216	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Amen, says the citizen.
 16217	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16218	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And I’m sure He will, says Joe.
 16219	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16220	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd at the sound of the sacring bell, headed by a crucifer with
 16221	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tacolytes, thurifers, boatbearers, readers, ostiarii, deacons and
 16222	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsubdeacons, the blessed company drew nigh of mitred abbots and priors

 16266	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNelson’s Pillar, Henry street, Mary street, Capel street, Little Britain
 16267	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstreet chanting the introit in Epiphania Domini which beginneth Surge,
 16268	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tilluminare and thereafter most sweetly the gradual Omnes which saith de
 16269	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSaba venient they did divers wonders such as casting out devils, raising
 16270	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe dead to life, multiplying fishes, healing the halt and the blind,
 16271	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdiscovering various articles which had been mislaid, interpreting and
 16272	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfulfilling the scriptures, blessing and prophesying. And last, beneath

 16282	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprayed that God might bless that house as he had blessed the house of
 16283	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAbraham and Isaac and Jacob and make the angels of His light to inhabit
 16284	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttherein. And entering he blessed the viands and the beverages and the
 16285	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcompany of all the blessed answered his prayers.
 16286	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16287	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Adiutorium nostrum in nomine Domini.
 16288	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16289	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Qui fecit cœlum et terram.
 16290	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16291	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Dominus vobiscum.
 16292	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16293	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Et cum spiritu tuo.
 16294	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16295	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd he laid his hands upon that he blessed and gave thanks and he prayed
 16296	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand they all with him prayed:
 16297	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16298	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Deus, cuius verbo sanctificantur omnia, benedictionem tuam effunde
 16299	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuper creaturas istas: et praesta ut quisquis eis secundum legem et
 16300	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvoluntatem Tuam cum gratiarum actione usus fuerit per invocationem
 16301	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsanctissimi nominis Tui corporis sanitatem et animæ tutelam Te auctore

 16303	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16304	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And so say all of us, says Jack.
 16305	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16306	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Thousand a year, Lambert, says Crofton or Crawford.
 16307	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16308	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Right, says Ned, taking up his John Jameson. And butter for fish.
 16309	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16310	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI was just looking around to see who the happy thought would strike when
 16311	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbe damned but in he comes again letting on to be in a hell of a hurry.
 16312	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16313	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I was just round at the courthouse, says he, looking for you. I hope
 16314	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI’m not...
 16315	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16316	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—No, says Martin, we’re ready.
 16317	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16318	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCourthouse my eye and your pockets hanging down with gold and silver.
 16319	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMean bloody scut. Stand us a drink itself. Devil a sweet fear! There’s
 16320	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta jew for you! All for number one. Cute as a shithouse rat. Hundred to
 16321	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfive.
 16322	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16323	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Don’t tell anyone, says the citizen,
 16324	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16325	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Beg your pardon, says he.
 16326	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16327	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Come on boys, says Martin, seeing it was looking blue. Come along now.
 16328	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16329	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Don’t tell anyone, says the citizen, letting a bawl out of him. It’s a
 16330	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsecret.
 16331	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16332	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd the bloody dog woke up and let a growl.
 16333	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16334	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Bye bye all, says Martin.
 16335	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16336	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd he got them out as quick as he could, Jack Power and Crofton or
 16337	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhatever you call him and him in the middle of them letting on to be all
 16338	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat sea and up with them on the bloody jaunting car.
 16339	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16340	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Off with you, says Martin to the jarvey.
 16341	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16342	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and, rising in the golden poop the
 16343	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thelmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off forward
 16344	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith all sail set, the spinnaker to larboard. A many comely nymphs drew
 16345	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnigh to starboard and to larboard and, clinging to the sides of
 16346	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe noble bark, they linked their shining forms as doth the cunning
 16347	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twheelwright when he fashions about the heart of his wheel the
 16348	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tequidistant rays whereof each one is sister to another and he binds them
 16349	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall with an outer ring and giveth speed to the feet of men whenas they
 16350	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tride to a hosting or contend for the smile of ladies fair. Even so did
 16351	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey come and set them, those willing nymphs, the undying sisters. And
 16352	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey laughed, sporting in a circle of their foam: and the bark clave the
 16353	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twaves.
 16354	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16355	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw the
 16356	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcitizen getting up to waddle to the door, puffing and blowing with the
 16357	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdropsy, and he cursing the curse of Cromwell on him, bell, book and
 16358	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcandle in Irish, spitting and spatting out of him and Joe and little Alf
 16359	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tround him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him.
 16360	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16361	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Let me alone, says he.
 16362	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16363	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd begob he got as far as the door and they holding him and he bawls
 16364	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout of him:
 16365	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16366	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Three cheers for Israel!

 16368	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tArrah, sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christ’ sake
 16369	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand don’t be making a public exhibition of yourself. Jesus, there’s
 16370	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\talways some bloody clown or other kicking up a bloody murder about
 16371	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbloody nothing. Gob, it’d turn the porter sour in your guts, so it
 16372	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould.
 16373	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16374	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and
 16375	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMartin telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and Alf
 16376	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand Joe at him to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews and
 16377	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe loafers calling for a speech and Jack Power trying to get him to sit
 16378	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdown on the car and hold his bloody jaw and a loafer with a patch over
 16379	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this eye starts singing If the man in the moon was a jew, jew, jew and a

 16382	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Eh, mister! Your fly is open, mister!
 16383	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t

 16385	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16386	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and Mercadante and Spinoza. And the
 16387	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSaviour was a jew and his father was a jew. Your God.
 16388	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16389	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—He had no father, says Martin. That’ll do now. Drive ahead.
 16390	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t

 16392	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16393	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Well, his uncle was a jew, says he. Your God was a jew. Christ was a
 16394	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjew like me.
 16395	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16396	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGob, the citizen made a plunge back into the shop.
 16397	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16398	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—By Jesus, says he, I’ll brain that bloody jewman for using the holy
 16399	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tname.
 16400	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16401	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBy Jesus, I’ll crucify him so I will. Give us that biscuitbox here.

 16405	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA large and appreciative gathering of friends and acquaintances from
 16406	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe metropolis and greater Dublin assembled in their thousands to bid
 16407	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfarewell to Nagyaságos uram Lipóti Virag, late of Messrs Alexander
 16408	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThom’s, printers to His Majesty, on the occasion of his departure
 16409	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor the distant clime of Százharminczbrojúgulyás-Dugulás (Meadow of
 16410	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMurmuring Waters). The ceremony which went off with great éclat was
 16411	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcharacterised by the most affecting cordiality. An illuminated scroll
 16412	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof ancient Irish vellum, the work of Irish artists, was presented to
 16413	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe distinguished phenomenologist on behalf of a large section of the
 16414	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcommunity and was accompanied by the gift of a silver casket, tastefully
 16415	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\texecuted in the style of ancient Celtic ornament, a work which reflects
 16416	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tevery credit on the makers, Messrs Jacob agus Jacob. The departing guest
 16417	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas the recipient of a hearty ovation, many of those who were present
 16418	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeing visibly moved when the select orchestra of Irish pipes struck
 16419	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tup the wellknown strains of Come Back to Erin, followed immediately
 16420	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby Rakóczsy’s March. Tarbarrels and bonfires were lighted along the
 16421	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcoastline of the four seas on the summits of the Hill of Howth, Three
 16422	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRock Mountain, Sugarloaf, Bray Head, the mountains of Mourne, the
 16423	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGaltees, the Ox and Donegal and Sperrin peaks, the Nagles and the
 16424	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBograghs, the Connemara hills, the reeks of M’Gillicuddy, Slieve Aughty,
 16425	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSlieve Bernagh and Slieve Bloom. Amid cheers that rent the welkin,
 16426	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tresponded to by answering cheers from a big muster of henchmen on the
 16427	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdistant Cambrian and Caledonian hills, the mastodontic pleasureship
 16428	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tslowly moved away saluted by a final floral tribute from the
 16429	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trepresentatives of the fair sex who were present in large numbers while,
 16430	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas it proceeded down the river, escorted by a flotilla of barges, the
 16431	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tflags of the Ballast office and Custom House were dipped in salute as
 16432	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere also those of the electrical power station at the Pigeonhouse and
 16433	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe Poolbeg Light. Visszontlátásra, kedvés barátom! Visszontlátásra!
 16434	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGone but not forgotten.
 16435	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16436	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGob, the devil wouldn’t stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin
 16437	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanyhow and out with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he
 16438	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshouting like a stuck pig, as good as any bloody play in the Queen’s
 16439	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\troyal theatre:
 16440	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16441	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Where is he till I murder him?
 16442	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t

 16444	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16445	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Bloody wars, says I, I’ll be in for the last gospel.
 16446	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16447	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut as luck would have it the jarvey got the nag’s head round the other
 16448	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tway and off with him.
 16449	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16450	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Hold on, citizen, says Joe. Stop!
 16451	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16452	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBegob he drew his hand and made a swipe and let fly. Mercy of God the
 16453	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsun was in his eyes or he’d have left him for dead. Gob, he near sent it
 16454	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinto the county Longford. The bloody nag took fright and the old
 16455	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmongrel after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting and
 16456	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlaughing and the old tinbox clattering along the street.
 16457	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16458	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe catastrophe was terrific and instantaneous in its effect. The
 16459	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tobservatory of Dunsink registered in all eleven shocks, all of the fifth
 16460	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgrade of Mercalli’s scale, and there is no record extant of a similar
 16461	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseismic disturbance in our island since the earthquake of 1534, the year
 16462	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the rebellion of Silken Thomas. The epicentre appears to have been
 16463	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat part of the metropolis which constitutes the Inn’s Quay ward and
 16464	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tparish of Saint Michan covering a surface of fortyone acres, two roods
 16465	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand one square pole or perch. All the lordly residences in the vicinity
 16466	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the palace of justice were demolished and that noble edifice itself,
 16467	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin which at the time of the catastrophe important legal debates were in
 16468	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprogress, is literally a mass of ruins beneath which it is to be
 16469	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfeared all the occupants have been buried alive. From the reports of
 16470	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\teyewitnesses it transpires that the seismic waves were accompanied by
 16471	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta violent atmospheric perturbation of cyclonic character. An article of

 16477	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin remote parts of the island respectively, the former on the third

 16479	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\textent of one foot three inches in the sandy beach of Holeopen bay near
 16480	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe old head of Kinsale. Other eyewitnesses depose that they observed

 16482	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tatmosphere at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory directed southwest
 16483	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby west. Messages of condolence and sympathy are being hourly received

 16535	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious
 16536	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tembrace. Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of
 16537	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud
 16538	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpromontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on
 16539	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on
 16540	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness
 16541	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to
 16542	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe stormtossed heart of man, Mary, star of the sea.
 16543	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16544	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe three girl friends were seated on the rocks, enjoying the evening
 16545	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tscene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly. Many a time and
 16546	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\toft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy
 16547	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine, Cissy
 16548	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCaffrey and Edy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and
 16549	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJacky Caffrey, two little curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits with
 16550	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcaps to match and the name H. M. S. Belleisle printed on both. For Tommy
 16551	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand Jacky Caffrey were twins, scarce four years old and very noisy and
 16552	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with
 16553	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbright merry faces and endearing ways about them. They were dabbling in
 16554	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe sand with their spades and buckets, building castles as children do,
 16555	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tor playing with their big coloured ball, happy as the day was long. And
 16556	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEdy Boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while
 16557	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight. He was but eleven
 16558	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmonths and nine days old and, though still a tiny toddler, was just
 16559	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeginning to lisp his first babyish words. Cissy Caffrey bent over to
 16560	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin.
 16561	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16562	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said. Say out big, big. I want a drink of
 16563	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twater.
 16564	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16565	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd baby prattled after her:
 16566	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16567	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—A jink a jink a jawbo.
 16568	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16569	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children,
 16570	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tso patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could never be got to
 16571	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttake his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that held his nose and
 16572	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpromised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden
 16573	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsyrup on. What a persuasive power that girl had! But to be sure baby
 16574	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBoardman was as good as gold, a perfect little dote in his new fancy
 16575	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbib. None of your spoilt beauties, Flora MacFlimsy sort, was Cissy
 16576	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCaffrey. A truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life, always with
 16577	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe
 16578	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tred lips, a girl lovable in the extreme. And Edy Boardman laughed too at
 16579	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe quaint language of little brother.
 16580	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16581	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and
 16582	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMaster Jacky. Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception
 16583	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto this golden rule. The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand
 16584	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhich Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go
 16585	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the
 16586	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMartello tower had. But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky was
 16587	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tselfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every little Irishman’s house
 16588	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tis his castle, he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the
 16589	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to relate!) the coveted castle
 16590	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttoo. Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master Tommy drew the
 16591	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tattention of the girl friends.
 16592	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16593	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively. At once! And you,
 16594	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJacky, for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand. Wait till I
 16595	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcatch you for that.
 16596	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16597	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for their
 16598	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbig sister’s word was law with the twins. And in a sad plight he was
 16599	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttoo after his misadventure. His little man-o’-war top and unmentionables
 16600	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing
 16601	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tover life’s tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was to
 16602	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbe seen on his smart little suit. Still the blue eyes were glistening
 16603	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness and
 16604	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and said if she was near him
 16605	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe wouldn’t be far from him, her eyes dancing in admonition.
 16606	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16607	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Nasty bold Jacky! she cried.
 16608	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16609	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly:
 16610	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16611	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What’s your name? Butter and cream?
 16612	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16613	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman. Is Cissy your
 16614	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsweetheart?
 16615	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16616	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Nao, tearful Tommy said.
 16617	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16618	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart? Cissy queried.
 16619	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16620	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Nao, Tommy said.
 16621	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16622	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I know, Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from her
 16623	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshortsighted eyes. I know who is Tommy’s sweetheart. Gerty is Tommy’s
 16624	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsweetheart.
 16625	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16626	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears.
 16627	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16628	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCissy’s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to
 16629	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEdy Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman
 16630	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcouldn’t see and to mind he didn’t wet his new tan shoes.
 16631	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16632	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut who was Gerty?
 16633	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16634	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions, lost in thought,
 16635	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgazing far away into the distance was, in very truth, as fair a specimen
 16636	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see. She was pronounced
 16637	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeautiful by all who knew her though, as folks often said, she was
 16638	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmore a Giltrap than a MacDowell. Her figure was slight and graceful,
 16639	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking
 16640	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof late had done her a world of good much better than the Widow Welch’s
 16641	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfemale pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to
 16642	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tget and that tired feeling. The waxen pallor of her face was almost
 16643	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine
 16644	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCupid’s bow, Greekly perfect. Her hands were of finely veined alabaster
 16645	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments
 16646	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcould make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves
 16647	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin bed or take a milk footbath either. Bertha Supple told that once to
 16648	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEdy Boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black out at daggers drawn
 16649	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith Gerty (the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to
 16650	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttime like the rest of mortals) and she told her not to let on whatever
 16651	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe did that it was her that told her or she’d never speak to her
 16652	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tagain. No. Honour where honour is due. There was an innate refinement, a
 16653	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlanguid queenly hauteur about Gerty which was unmistakably evidenced in
 16654	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther delicate hands and higharched instep. Had kind fate but willed her
 16655	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had she
 16656	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tonly received the benefit of a good education Gerty MacDowell might
 16657	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\teasily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen
 16658	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\therself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician suitors
 16659	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to her.
 16660	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMayhap it was this, the love that might have been, that lent to her
 16661	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsoftlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed meaning,
 16662	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes, a charm
 16663	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfew could resist. Why have women such eyes of witchery? Gerty’s were of
 16664	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe bluest Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive
 16665	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrows. Time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive. It
 16666	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas Madame Vera Verity, directress of the Woman Beautiful page of the
 16667	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPrincess Novelette, who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which
 16668	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgave that haunting expression to the eyes, so becoming in leaders
 16669	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof fashion, and she had never regretted it. Then there was blushing
 16670	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tscientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you
 16671	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thave a beautiful face but your nose? That would suit Mrs Dignam because
 16672	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe had a button one. But Gerty’s crowning glory was her wealth of
 16673	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twonderful hair. It was dark brown with a natural wave in it. She had cut
 16674	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit that very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about
 16675	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters and pared her nails
 16676	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttoo, Thursday for wealth. And just now at Edy’s words as a telltale
 16677	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tflush, delicate as the faintest rosebloom, crept into her cheeks she
 16678	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlooked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety God’s
 16679	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfair land of Ireland did not hold her equal.
 16680	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16681	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFor an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes. She
 16682	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue.
 16683	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tInclination prompted her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent.
 16684	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into
 16685	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young May
 16686	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmorning. She knew right well, no-one better, what made squinty Edy
 16687	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsay that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a
 16688	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlovers’ quarrel. As per usual somebody’s nose was out of joint about the
 16689	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tboy that had the bicycle off the London bridge road always riding up
 16690	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand down in front of her window. Only now his father kept him in in the
 16691	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tevenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was
 16692	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton and he was going to go to Trinity college to study for a doctor when
 16693	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the left the high school like his brother W. E. Wylie who was racing
 16694	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the bicycle races in Trinity college university. Little recked he
 16695	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tperhaps for what she felt, that dull aching void in her heart sometimes,
 16696	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpiercing to the core. Yet he was young and perchance he might learn
 16697	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto love her in time. They were protestants in his family and of course
 16698	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGerty knew Who came first and after Him the Blessed Virgin and then
 16699	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSaint Joseph. But he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite nose and
 16700	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the was what he looked, every inch a gentleman, the shape of his head too
 16701	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere something
 16702	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\toff the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his
 16703	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes
 16704	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand besides they were both of a size too he and she and that was why Edy
 16705	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBoardman thought she was so frightfully clever because he didn’t go and
 16706	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tride up and down in front of her bit of a garden.
 16707	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16708	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of
 16709	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be
 16710	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout. A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes (because it
 16711	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas expected in the Lady’s Pictorial that electric blue would be worn)
 16712	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket (in
 16713	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhich she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her
 16714	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfavourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit) and a navy
 16715	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthreequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure
 16716	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto perfection. She wore a coquettish little love of a hat of wideleaved
 16717	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue chenille and
 16718	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone. All Tuesday week afternoon
 16719	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe was hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what she
 16720	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twanted at Clery’s summer sales, the very it, slightly shopsoiled but you
 16721	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould never notice, seven fingers two and a penny. She did it up all by
 16722	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\therself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then, smiling at the
 16723	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her! And when she put
 16724	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that would take the
 16725	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshine out of some people she knew. Her shoes were the newest thing in
 16726	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfootwear (Edy Boardman prided herself that she was very petite but she
 16727	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnever had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a five, and never would ash,
 16728	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\toak or elm) with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over
 16729	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther higharched instep. Her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect
 16730	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tproportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of
 16731	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and
 16732	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twide garter tops. As for undies they were Gerty’s chief care and who
 16733	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen (though
 16734	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGerty would never see seventeen again) can find it in his heart to
 16735	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblame her? She had four dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery,
 16736	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthree garments and nighties extra, and each set slotted with different
 16737	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcoloured ribbons, rosepink, pale blue, mauve and peagreen, and she aired
 16738	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem herself and blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed
 16739	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldn’t
 16740	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttrust those washerwomen as far as she’d see them scorching the things.
 16741	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against hope, her own colour
 16742	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because
 16743	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe green she wore that day week brought grief because his father
 16744	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because
 16745	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that
 16746	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmorning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that
 16747	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas for luck and lovers’ meeting if you put those things on inside
 16748	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long as it
 16749	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twasn’t of a Friday.
 16750	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16751	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd yet and yet! That strained look on her face! A gnawing sorrow is
 16752	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthere all the time. Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give
 16753	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tworlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where, giving
 16754	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tway to tears, she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings
 16755	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthough not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the
 16756	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmirror. You are lovely, Gerty, it said. The paly light of evening falls
 16757	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tupon a face infinitely sad and wistful. Gerty MacDowell yearns in vain.
 16758	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tYes, she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage
 16759	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thas been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T.
 16760	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tC. D. (because the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs Wylie)
 16761	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand in the fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was wearing a
 16762	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not
 16763	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto be. He was too young to understand. He would not believe in love, a
 16764	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twoman’s birthright. The night of the party long ago in Stoer’s (he was
 16765	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstill in short trousers) when they were alone and he stole an arm round
 16766	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther waist she went white to the very lips. He called her little one in
 16767	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss (the first!) but it
 16768	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas only the end of her nose and then he hastened from the room with a
 16769	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tremark about refreshments. Impetuous fellow! Strength of character had
 16770	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnever been Reggy Wylie’s strong point and he who would woo and win Gerty
 16771	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMacDowell must be a man among men. But waiting, always waiting to
 16772	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbe asked and it was leap year too and would soon be over. No prince
 16773	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcharming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her feet
 16774	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbut rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who had not found
 16775	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this ideal, perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey, and who would
 16776	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunderstand, take her in his sheltering arms, strain her to him in all
 16777	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort her with a long
 16778	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlong kiss. It would be like heaven. For such a one she yearns this balmy
 16779	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsummer eve. With all the heart of her she longs to be his only, his
 16780	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\taffianced bride for riches for poor, in sickness in health, till death
 16781	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tus two part, from this to this day forward.
 16782	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16783	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was
 16784	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjust thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his
 16785	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlittle wife to be. Then they could talk about her till they went blue in
 16786	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe face, Bertha Supple too, and Edy, little spitfire, because she would
 16787	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbe twentytwo in November. She would care for him with creature comforts
 16788	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttoo for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that
 16789	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfeeling of hominess. Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and
 16790	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tqueen Ann’s pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions
 16791	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire, dredge
 16792	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction,
 16793	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthen cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though
 16794	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe didn’t like the eating part when there were any people that made her
 16795	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshy and often she wondered why you couldn’t eat something poetical like
 16796	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tviolets or roses and they would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom
 16797	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith pictures and engravings and the photograph of grandpapa Giltrap’s
 16798	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlovely dog Garryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz
 16799	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcovers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in Clery’s summer
 16800	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjumble sales like they have in rich houses. He would be tall with
 16801	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbroad shoulders (she had always admired tall men for a husband) with
 16802	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache
 16803	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand they would go on the continent for their honeymoon (three wonderful
 16804	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tweeks!) and then, when they settled down in a nice snug and cosy little
 16805	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thomely house, every morning they would both have brekky, simple but
 16806	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tperfectly served, for their own two selves and before he went out to
 16807	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbusiness he would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and gaze
 16808	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor a moment deep down into her eyes.
 16809	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16810	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEdy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she
 16811	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbuttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off
 16812	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight. But Tommy said
 16813	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with the
 16814	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tball and if he took it there’d be wigs on the green but Tommy said it
 16815	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if
 16816	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou please. The temper of him! O, he was a man already was little Tommy
 16817	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCaffrey since he was out of pinnies. Edy told him no, no and to be off
 16818	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnow with him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him.
 16819	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16820	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You’re not my sister, naughty Tommy said. It’s my ball.
 16821	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16822	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up, look up high at her
 16823	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfinger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and
 16824	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTommy after it in full career, having won the day.
 16825	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16826	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Anything for a quiet life, laughed Ciss.
 16827	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16828	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd she tickled tiny tot’s two cheeks to make him forget and played
 16829	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\there’s the lord mayor, here’s his two horses, here’s his gingerbread
 16830	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcarriage and here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper
 16831	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchin. But Edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way
 16832	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlike that from everyone always petting him.
 16833	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16834	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I’d like to give him something, she said, so I would, where I won’t
 16835	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsay.
 16836	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16837	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—On the beeoteetom, laughed Cissy merrily.
 16838	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16839	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy
 16840	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaying an unladylike thing like that out loud she’d be ashamed of her
 16841	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlife to say, flushing a deep rosy red, and Edy Boardman said she was
 16842	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsure the gentleman opposite heard what she said. But not a pin cared
 16843	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCiss.
 16844	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16845	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Let him! she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of
 16846	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther nose. Give it to him too on the same place as quick as I’d look at
 16847	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim.
 16848	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16849	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMadcap Ciss with her golliwog curls. You had to laugh at her sometimes.
 16850	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFor instance when she asked you would you have some more Chinese tea and
 16851	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men’s faces on her
 16852	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go
 16853	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhere you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the Miss
 16854	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhite. That was just like Cissycums. O, and will you ever forget her the
 16855	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tevening she dressed up in her father’s suit and hat and the burned cork
 16856	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmoustache and walked down Tritonville road, smoking a cigarette. There
 16857	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas none to come up to her for fun. But she was sincerity itself, one of
 16858	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made, not one of your twofaced
 16859	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthings, too sweet to be wholesome.
 16860	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16861	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing
 16862	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanthem of the organ. It was the men’s temperance retreat conducted
 16863	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby the missioner, the reverend John Hughes S. J., rosary, sermon and
 16864	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbenediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament. They were there gathered
 16865	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttogether without distinction of social class (and a most edifying
 16866	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspectacle it was to see) in that simple fane beside the waves, after the
 16867	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstorms of this weary world, kneeling before the feet of the immaculate,
 16868	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\treciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto, beseeching her to intercede
 16869	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor them, the old familiar words, holy Mary, holy virgin of virgins. How
 16870	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsad to poor Gerty’s ears! Had her father only avoided the clutches of
 16871	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe demon drink, by taking the pledge or those powders the drink habit
 16872	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcured in Pearson’s Weekly, she might now be rolling in her carriage,
 16873	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsecond to none. Over and over had she told herself that as she mused by
 16874	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe dying embers in a brown study without the lamp because she hated two
 16875	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlights or oftentimes gazing out of the window dreamily by the hour at
 16876	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe rain falling on the rusty bucket, thinking. But that vile decoction
 16877	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhich has ruined so many hearths and homes had cast its shadow over her
 16878	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchildhood days. Nay, she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of
 16879	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tviolence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father, a prey to
 16880	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe fumes of intoxication, forget himself completely for if there was
 16881	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tone thing of all things that Gerty knew it was that the man who lifts
 16882	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this hand to a woman save in the way of kindness, deserves to be branded
 16883	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas the lowest of the low.
 16884	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16885	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful,
 16886	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tVirgin most merciful. And Gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard
 16887	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman
 16888	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\toff Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like
 16889	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thimself passing along the strand taking a short walk. You never saw him
 16890	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tany way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a
 16891	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfather because he was too old or something or on account of his face
 16892	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t(it was a palpable case of Doctor Fell) or his carbuncly nose with the
 16893	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose. Poor
 16894	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfather! With all his faults she loved him still when he sang Tell me,
 16895	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMary, how to woo thee or My love and cottage near Rochelle and they had
 16896	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstewed cockles and lettuce with Lazenby’s salad dressing for supper and
 16897	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhen he sang The moon hath raised with Mr Dignam that died suddenly and
 16898	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas buried, God have mercy on him, from a stroke. Her mother’s birthday
 16899	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat was and Charley was home on his holidays and Tom and Mr Dignam and
 16900	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMrs and Patsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have had a group taken.
 16901	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNo-one would have thought the end was so near. Now he was laid to rest.
 16902	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest
 16903	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof his days and he couldn’t even go to the funeral on account of the
 16904	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgout and she had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples
 16905	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom his office about Catesby’s cork lino, artistic, standard designs,
 16906	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfit for a palace, gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the
 16907	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thome.
 16908	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16909	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the
 16910	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thouse, a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in
 16911	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgold. And when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was
 16912	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn’t
 16913	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlike her mother’s taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single
 16914	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthing they ever had words about, taking snuff. Everyone thought the
 16915	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tworld of her for her gentle ways. It was Gerty who turned off the gas at
 16916	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe main every night and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of that
 16917	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplace where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime Mr
 16918	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTunney the grocer’s christmas almanac, the picture of halcyon days
 16919	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhere a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a
 16920	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthreecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with
 16921	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\toldtime chivalry through her lattice window. You could see there was a
 16922	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstory behind it. The colours were done something lovely. She was in
 16923	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in
 16924	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat. She often looked at them
 16925	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own
 16926	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tarms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back
 16927	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand thought about those times because she had found out in Walker’s
 16928	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrap about the
 16929	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thalcyon days what they meant.
 16930	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16931	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion
 16932	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttill at last Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was
 16933	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tno getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he
 16934	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcould down towards the seaweedy rocks. Needless to say poor Tommy was
 16935	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnot slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was
 16936	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted
 16937	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe ball. Our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and
 16938	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to
 16939	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther please. The gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw
 16940	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit up the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the slope and
 16941	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstopped right under Gerty’s skirt near the little pool by the rock. The
 16942	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttwins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it away and
 16943	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlet them fight for it so Gerty drew back her foot but she wished their
 16944	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstupid ball hadn’t come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she
 16945	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmissed and Edy and Cissy laughed.
 16946	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16947	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said.
 16948	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16949	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGerty smiled assent and bit her lip. A delicate pink crept into her
 16950	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted
 16951	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a
 16952	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down
 16953	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttowards the shingle. Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw
 16954	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tattention on account of the gentleman opposite looking. She felt the
 16955	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twarm flush, a danger signal always with Gerty MacDowell, surging and
 16956	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tflaming into her cheeks. Till then they had only exchanged glances of
 16957	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a
 16958	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlook at him and the face that met her gaze there in the twilight, wan
 16959	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand strangely drawn, seemed to her the saddest she had ever seen.
 16960	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16961	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThrough the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted
 16962	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of
 16963	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\toriginal sin, spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray
 16964	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor us, vessel of singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose. And
 16965	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcareworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many
 16966	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twho had erred and wandered, their eyes wet with contrition but for all
 16967	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat bright with hope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told
 16968	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem what the great saint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary, the
 16969	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmost pious Virgin’s intercessory power that it was not recorded in any
 16970	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tage that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned
 16971	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby her.
 16972	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16973	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of
 16974	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchildhood are but as fleeting summer showers. Cissy Caffrey played with
 16975	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbaby Boardman till he crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air. Peep
 16976	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was Cissy
 16977	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah! and, my word,
 16978	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdidn’t the little chap enjoy that! And then she told him to say papa.
 16979	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16980	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Say papa, baby. Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa.
 16981	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16982	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for
 16983	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\televen months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of
 16984	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thealth, a perfect little bunch of love, and he would certainly turn out
 16985	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto be something great, they said.
 16986	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16987	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Haja ja ja haja.
 16988	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16989	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to
 16990	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried
 16991	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout, holy saint Denis, that he was possing wet and to double the half
 16992	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblanket the other way under him. Of course his infant majesty was most
 16993	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tobstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it:
 16994	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16995	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa.
 16996	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 16997	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks. It was all
 16998	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tno use soothering him with no, nono, baby, no and telling him about the
 16999	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgeegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss, always readywitted, gave
 17000	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was
 17001	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tquickly appeased.
 17002	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17003	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out
 17004	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof that and not get on her nerves, no hour to be out, and the little
 17005	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrats of twins. She gazed out towards the distant sea. It was like the
 17006	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpaintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured
 17007	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out, the
 17008	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tevening and the clouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and to
 17009	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they burned
 17010	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the church like a kind of waft. And while she gazed her heart went
 17011	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpitapat. Yes, it was her he was looking at, and there was meaning in his
 17012	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlook. His eyes burned into her as though they would search her through
 17013	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand through, read her very soul. Wonderful eyes they were, superbly
 17014	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\texpressive, but could you trust them? People were so queer. She could
 17015	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsee at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he
 17016	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas a foreigner, the image of the photo she had of Martin Harvey, the
 17017	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmatinee idol, only for the moustache which she preferred because she
 17018	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twasn’t stagestruck like Winny Rippingham that wanted they two to always
 17019	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdress the same on account of a play but she could not see whether he had
 17020	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tan aquiline nose or a slightly retroussé from where he was sitting. He
 17021	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas in deep mourning, she could see that, and the story of a haunting
 17022	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsorrow was written on his face. She would have given worlds to know what
 17023	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit was. He was looking up so intently, so still, and he saw her kick the
 17024	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles of her shoes if
 17025	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down. She was glad
 17026	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking
 17027	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tReggy Wylie might be out but that was far away. Here was that of which
 17028	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe had so often dreamed. It was he who mattered and there was joy on
 17029	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he
 17030	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas like no-one else. The very heart of the girlwoman went out to him,
 17031	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther dreamhusband, because she knew on the instant it was him. If he had
 17032	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuffered, more sinned against than sinning, or even, even, if he had
 17033	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeen himself a sinner, a wicked man, she cared not. Even if he was a
 17034	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprotestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved
 17035	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther. There were wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm. She was a
 17036	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twomanly woman not like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known,
 17037	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthose cyclists showing off what they hadn’t got and she just yearned to
 17038	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknow all, to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her,
 17039	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmake him forget the memory of the past. Then mayhap he would embrace her
 17040	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgently, like a real man, crushing her soft body to him, and love her,
 17041	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this ownest girlie, for herself alone.
 17042	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17043	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRefuge of sinners. Comfortress of the afflicted. Ora pro nobis. Well has
 17044	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can
 17045	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnever be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for
 17046	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own
 17047	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\theart. Gerty could picture the whole scene in the church, the stained
 17048	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglass windows lighted up, the candles, the flowers and the blue banners
 17049	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the blessed Virgin’s sodality and Father Conroy was helping Canon
 17050	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tO’Hanlon at the altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes cast
 17051	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdown. He looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and
 17052	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tclean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever she
 17053	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbecame a Dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come to the
 17054	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconvent for the novena of Saint Dominic. He told her that time when she
 17055	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttold him about that in confession, crimsoning up to the roots of her
 17056	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thair for fear he could see, not to be troubled because that was only the
 17057	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvoice of nature and we were all subject to nature’s laws, he said, in
 17058	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthis life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of
 17059	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twoman instituted by God, he said, and that Our Blessed Lady herself said
 17060	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto the archangel Gabriel be it done unto me according to Thy Word. He
 17061	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas so kind and holy and often and often she thought and thought could
 17062	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design for him as a
 17063	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpresent or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the mantelpiece
 17064	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhite and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house to tell
 17065	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours’
 17066	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tadoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or
 17067	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tperhaps an album of illuminated views of Dublin or some place.
 17068	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17069	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky
 17070	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthrew the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it. Little
 17071	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmonkeys common as ditchwater. Someone ought to take them and give them
 17072	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places, the both of
 17073	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem. And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because they
 17074	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned.
 17075	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17076	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Jacky! Tommy!
 17077	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17078	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNot they! What a great notion they had! So Cissy said it was the very
 17079	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlast time she’d ever bring them out. She jumped up and called them and
 17080	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe ran down the slope past him, tossing her hair behind her which had
 17081	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the
 17082	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn’t get it to grow
 17083	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlong because it wasn’t natural so she could just go and throw her hat at
 17084	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit. She ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn’t rip up
 17085	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot
 17086	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever
 17087	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just because she
 17088	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end of
 17089	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible. It
 17090	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould have served her just right if she had tripped up over something
 17091	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\taccidentally on purpose with her high crooked French heels on her to
 17092	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmake her look tall and got a fine tumble. Tableau! That would have been
 17093	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta very charming exposé for a gentleman like that to witness.
 17094	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17095	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tQueen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints,
 17096	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handed
 17097	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe thurible to Canon O’Hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the
 17098	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBlessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she was
 17099	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\titching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn’t
 17100	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbecause she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger
 17101	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmistake in all her life because Gerty could see without looking that
 17102	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the never took his eyes off of her and then Canon O’Hanlon handed the
 17103	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the Blessed
 17104	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSacrament and the choir began to sing the Tantum ergo and she just swung
 17105	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to the Tantumer
 17106	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgosa cramen tum. Three and eleven she paid for those stockings in
 17107	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSparrow’s of George’s street on the Tuesday, no the Monday before Easter
 17108	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand there wasn’t a brack on them and that was what he was looking at,
 17109	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttransparent, and not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape
 17110	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnor form (the cheek of her!) because he had eyes in his head to see the
 17111	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdifference for himself.
 17112	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17113	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with
 17114	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a
 17115	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstreel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only
 17116	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat
 17117	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thanging like a caricature. Gerty just took off her hat for a moment to
 17118	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsettle her hair and a prettier, a daintier head of nutbrown tresses
 17119	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas never seen on a girl’s shoulders—a radiant little vision, in sooth,
 17120	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\talmost maddening in its sweetness. You would have to travel many a long
 17121	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmile before you found a head of hair the like of that. She could almost
 17122	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsee the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her
 17123	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttingling in every nerve. She put on her hat so that she could see from
 17124	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunderneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath
 17125	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcaught as she caught the expression in his eyes. He was eying her as a
 17126	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsnake eyes its prey. Her woman’s instinct told her that she had raised
 17127	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat
 17128	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose.
 17129	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17130	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEdy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty,
 17131	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thalf smiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to nurse the
 17132	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbaby. Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why
 17133	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tno-one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of
 17134	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thers. And she said to Gerty:
 17135	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17136	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—A penny for your thoughts.
 17137	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17138	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What? replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth. I
 17139	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas only wondering was it late.
 17140	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17141	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBecause she wished to goodness they’d take the snottynosed twins and
 17142	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just
 17143	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgave a gentle hint about its being late. And when Cissy came up Edy
 17144	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tasked her the time and Miss Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was half
 17145	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpast kissing time, time to kiss again. But Edy wanted to know because
 17146	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey were told to be in early.
 17147	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17148	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Wait, said Cissy, I’ll run ask my uncle Peter over there what’s the
 17149	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttime by his conundrum.
 17150	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17151	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSo over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his
 17152	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his
 17153	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twatchchain, looking up at the church. Passionate nature though he was
 17154	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGerty could see that he had enormous control over himself. One moment he
 17155	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze, and the
 17156	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnext moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol expressed
 17157	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin every line of his distinguishedlooking figure.
 17158	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17159	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the
 17160	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tright time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch, listening to it
 17161	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his
 17162	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twatch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the
 17163	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsun was set. His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in
 17164	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmeasured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones.
 17165	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said
 17166	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this waterworks were out of order.
 17167	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17168	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThen they sang the second verse of the Tantum ergo and Canon O’Hanlon
 17169	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgot up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down and he told
 17170	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFather Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the
 17171	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tflowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and she could
 17172	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsee the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she
 17173	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tswung her leg more in and out in time. It was getting darker but he
 17174	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcould see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch
 17175	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tor whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands
 17176	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tback into his pockets. She felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over
 17177	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against
 17178	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther stays that that thing must be coming on because the last time too
 17179	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas when she clipped her hair on account of the moon. His dark eyes
 17180	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfixed themselves on her again drinking in her every contour, literally
 17181	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tworshipping at her shrine. If ever there was undisguised admiration in a
 17182	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tman’s passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that man’s face.
 17183	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIt is for you, Gertrude MacDowell, and you know it.
 17184	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17185	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEdy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty
 17186	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnoticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect
 17187	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbecause it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place
 17188	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins’ caps and tidied
 17189	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O’Hanlon stood
 17190	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tup with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the
 17191	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcard to read off and he read out Panem de coelo praestitisti eis and Edy
 17192	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand Cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but
 17193	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered with
 17194	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tscathing politeness when Edy asked her was she heartbroken about her
 17195	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbest boy throwing her over. Gerty winced sharply. A brief cold blaze
 17196	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn immeasurable. It hurt—O
 17197	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyes, it cut deep because Edy had her own quiet way of saying things
 17198	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlike that she knew would wound like the confounded little cat she was.
 17199	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGerty’s lips parted swiftly to frame the word but she fought back
 17200	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe sob that rose to her throat, so slim, so flawless, so beautifully
 17201	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmoulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of. She had loved him
 17202	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbetter than he knew. Lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex
 17203	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant
 17204	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthere was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears. Their eyes were
 17205	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprobing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back in
 17206	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see.
 17207	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17208	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O, responded Gerty, quick as lightning, laughing, and the proud head
 17209	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tflashed up. I can throw my cap at who I like because it’s leap year.
 17210	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17211	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHer words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of the
 17212	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tringdove, but they cut the silence icily. There was that in her young
 17213	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvoice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with. As
 17214	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck
 17215	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as
 17216	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmuch as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen
 17217	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpieces. And if ever after he dared to presume she could give him one
 17218	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlook of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot. Miss
 17219	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpuny little Edy’s countenance fell to no slight extent and Gerty could
 17220	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsee by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering
 17221	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trage though she hid it, the little kinnatt, because that shaft had
 17222	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstruck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was
 17223	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsomething aloof, apart, in another sphere, that she was not of them and
 17224	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnever would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it
 17225	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tso they could put that in their pipe and smoke it.
 17226	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17227	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEdy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked in
 17228	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the
 17229	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior. And Cissy told him
 17230	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttoo that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby
 17231	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlooked just too ducky, laughing up out of his gleeful eyes, and Cissy
 17232	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpoked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby, without as
 17233	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmuch as by your leave, sent up his compliments to all and sundry on to
 17234	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this brandnew dribbling bib.
 17235	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17236	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O my! Puddeny pie! protested Ciss. He has his bib destroyed.
 17237	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17238	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe slight contretemps claimed her attention but in two twos she set
 17239	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat little matter to rights.
 17240	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17241	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and Edy
 17242	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tasked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was
 17243	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tflying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed
 17244	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction
 17245	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbecause just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet
 17246	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseashore because Canon O’Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that
 17247	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFather Conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the
 17248	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBlessed Sacrament in his hands.
 17249	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17250	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHow moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse
 17251	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof Erin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same
 17252	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttime a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither,
 17253	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthither, with a tiny lost cry. And she could see far away the lights of
 17254	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of
 17255	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpaints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter
 17256	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould be going his rounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along
 17257	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby shady Tritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the
 17258	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlamp near her window where Reggy Wylie used to turn his freewheel like
 17259	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe read in that book The Lamplighter by Miss Cummins, author of Mabel
 17260	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tVaughan and other tales. For Gerty had her dreams that no-one knew of.
 17261	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe loved to read poetry and when she got a keepsake from Bertha Supple
 17262	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof that lovely confession album with the coralpink cover to write her
 17263	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthoughts in she laid it in the drawer of her toilettable which, though
 17264	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit did not err on the side of luxury, was scrupulously neat and clean.
 17265	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIt was there she kept her girlish treasure trove, the tortoiseshell
 17266	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcombs, her child of Mary badge, the whiterose scent, the eyebrowleine,
 17267	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her things came
 17268	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thome from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts written in it
 17269	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin violet ink that she bought in Hely’s of Dame Street for she felt that
 17270	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe too could write poetry if she could only express herself like that
 17271	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpoem that appealed to her so deeply that she had copied out of the
 17272	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnewspaper she found one evening round the potherbs. Art thou real, my
 17273	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tideal? it was called by Louis J Walsh, Magherafelt, and after there was
 17274	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsomething about twilight, wilt thou ever? and ofttimes the beauty of
 17275	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpoetry, so sad in its transient loveliness, had misted her eyes with
 17276	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsilent tears for she felt that the years were slipping by for her,
 17277	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tone by one, and but for that one shortcoming she knew she need fear no
 17278	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcompetition and that was an accident coming down Dalkey hill and she
 17279	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\talways tried to conceal it. But it must end, she felt. If she saw that
 17280	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmagic lure in his eyes there would be no holding back for her. Love
 17281	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlaughs at locksmiths. She would make the great sacrifice. Her every
 17282	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\teffort would be to share his thoughts. Dearer than the whole world
 17283	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould she be to him and gild his days with happiness. There was the
 17284	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tallimportant question and she was dying to know was he a married man or
 17285	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like the nobleman
 17286	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith the foreign name from the land of song had to have her put into a
 17287	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmadhouse, cruel only to be kind. But even if—what then? Would it make
 17288	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta very great difference? From everything in the least indelicate her
 17289	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfinebred nature instinctively recoiled. She loathed that sort of person,
 17290	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe fallen women off the accommodation walk beside the Dodder that went
 17291	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith the soldiers and coarse men with no respect for a girl’s honour,
 17292	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdegrading the sex and being taken up to the police station. No, no:
 17293	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnot that. They would be just good friends like a big brother and sister
 17294	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twithout all that other in spite of the conventions of Society with a big
 17295	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tess. Perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days
 17296	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeyond recall. She thought she understood. She would try to understand
 17297	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim because men were so different. The old love was waiting, waiting
 17298	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith little white hands stretched out, with blue appealing eyes. Heart
 17299	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof mine! She would follow, her dream of love, the dictates of her heart
 17300	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat told her he was her all in all, the only man in all the world for
 17301	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther for love was the master guide. Nothing else mattered. Come what
 17302	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmight she would be wild, untrammelled, free.
 17303	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17304	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCanon O’Hanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacle and
 17305	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgenuflected and the choir sang Laudate Dominum omnes gentes and then he
 17306	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlocked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and Father
 17307	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tConroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked wasn’t she
 17308	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcoming but Jacky Caffrey called out:
 17309	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17310	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O, look, Cissy!
 17311	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17312	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over the
 17313	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttrees beside the church, blue and then green and purple.
 17314	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17315	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—It’s fireworks, Cissy Caffrey said.
 17316	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17317	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church,
 17318	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thelterskelter, Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and Cissy
 17319	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tholding Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn’t fall running.
 17320	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17321	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Come on, Gerty, Cissy called. It’s the bazaar fireworks.
 17322	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17323	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut Gerty was adamant. She had no intention of being at their beck and
 17324	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcall. If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could
 17325	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsee from where she was. The eyes that were fastened upon her set her
 17326	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpulses tingling. She looked at him a moment, meeting his glance, and
 17327	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta light broke in upon her. Whitehot passion was in that face, passion
 17328	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsilent as the grave, and it had made her his. At last they were left
 17329	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\talone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he could
 17330	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbe trusted to the death, steadfast, a sterling man, a man of inflexible
 17331	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thonour to his fingertips. His hands and face were working and a tremour
 17332	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twent over her. She leaned back far to look up where the fireworks were
 17333	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking up
 17334	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand there was no-one to see only him and her when she revealed all her
 17335	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgraceful beautifully shaped legs like that, supply soft and delicately
 17336	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trounded, and she seemed to hear the panting of his heart, his hoarse
 17337	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbreathing, because she knew too about the passion of men like that,
 17338	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thotblooded, because Bertha Supple told her once in dead secret and made
 17339	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther swear she’d never about the gentleman lodger that was staying with
 17340	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem out of the Congested Districts Board that had pictures cut out of
 17341	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpapers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said he used to do
 17342	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsomething not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in the bed. But
 17343	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthis was altogether different from a thing like that because there was
 17344	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall the difference because she could almost feel him draw her face to
 17345	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this and the first quick hot touch of his handsome lips. Besides there
 17346	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas absolution so long as you didn’t do the other thing before being
 17347	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmarried and there ought to be women priests that would understand
 17348	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twithout your telling out and Cissy Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy
 17349	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tkind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too, my dear, and Winny
 17350	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRippingham so mad about actors’ photographs and besides it was on
 17351	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\taccount of that other thing coming on the way it did.
 17352	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17353	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned back
 17354	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and
 17355	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey all saw it and they all shouted to look, look, there it was and
 17356	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was
 17357	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tflying through the air, a soft thing, to and fro, dark. And she saw a
 17358	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlong Roman candle going up over the trees, up, up, and, in the tense
 17359	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thush, they were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and
 17360	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thigher and she had to lean back more and more to look up after it, high,
 17361	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thigh, almost out of sight, and her face was suffused with a divine, an
 17362	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tentrancing blush from straining back and he could see her other things
 17363	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttoo, nainsook knickers, the fabric that caresses the skin, better than
 17364	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthose other pettiwidth, the green, four and eleven, on account of being
 17365	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhite and she let him and she saw that he saw and then it went so high
 17366	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in every limb from
 17367	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeing bent so far back that he had a full view high up above her knee
 17368	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhere no-one ever not even on the swing or wading and she wasn’t ashamed
 17369	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand he wasn’t either to look in that immodest way like that because he
 17370	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcouldn’t resist the sight of the wondrous revealment half offered like
 17371	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthose skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen looking and he
 17372	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tkept on looking, looking. She would fain have cried to him chokingly,
 17373	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\theld out her snowy slender arms to him to come, to feel his lips laid on
 17374	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther white brow, the cry of a young girl’s love, a little strangled cry,
 17375	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twrung from her, that cry that has rung through the ages. And then a
 17376	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and O! then the Roman candle
 17377	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tburst and it was like a sigh of O! and everyone cried O! O! in raptures
 17378	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they
 17379	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshed and ah! they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden, O so
 17380	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlovely, O, soft, sweet, soft!
 17381	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17382	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThen all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent. Ah! She
 17383	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglanced at him as she bent forward quickly, a pathetic little glance of
 17384	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpiteous protest, of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl. He
 17385	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas leaning back against the rock behind. Leopold Bloom (for it is he)
 17386	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstands silent, with bowed head before those young guileless eyes. What a
 17387	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrute he had been! At it again? A fair unsullied soul had called to him
 17388	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand, wretch that he was, how had he answered? An utter cad he had been!
 17389	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe of all men! But there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes,
 17390	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and
 17391	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twandered. Should a girl tell? No, a thousand times no. That was their
 17392	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsecret, only theirs, alone in the hiding twilight and there was none to
 17393	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknow or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the evening
 17394	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto and fro and little bats don’t tell.
 17395	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17396	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCissy Caffrey whistled, imitating the boys in the football field to show
 17397	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhat a great person she was: and then she cried:
 17398	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17399	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Gerty! Gerty! We’re going. Come on. We can see from farther up.

 17401	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGerty had an idea, one of love’s little ruses. She slipped a hand into
 17402	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of
 17403	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcourse without letting him and then slipped it back. Wonder if he’s too
 17404	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfar to. She rose. Was it goodbye? No. She had to go but they would meet
 17405	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tagain, there, and she would dream of that till then, tomorrow, of her
 17406	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdream of yester eve. She drew herself up to her full height. Their souls
 17407	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmet in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart, full
 17408	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof a strange shining, hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face. She
 17409	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thalf smiled at him wanly, a sweet forgiving smile, a smile that verged
 17410	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton tears, and then they parted.
 17411	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17412	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSlowly, without looking back she went down the uneven strand to Cissy,
 17413	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto Edy to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey, to little baby Boardman. It was
 17414	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdarker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and
 17415	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tslippy seaweed. She walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic
 17416	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof her but with care and very slowly because—because Gerty MacDowell
 17417	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas...
 17418	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17419	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTight boots? No. She’s lame! O!
 17420	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17421	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom watched her as she limped away. Poor girl! That’s why she’s
 17422	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tleft on the shelf and the others did a sprint. Thought something was
 17423	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twrong by the cut of her jib. Jilted beauty. A defect is ten times worse
 17424	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin a woman. But makes them polite. Glad I didn’t know it when she was on
 17425	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshow. Hot little devil all the same. I wouldn’t mind. Curiosity like a
 17426	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnun or a negress or a girl with glasses. That squinty one is delicate.
 17427	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNear her monthlies, I expect, makes them feel ticklish. I have such
 17428	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta bad headache today. Where did I put the letter? Yes, all right. All
 17429	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tkinds of crazy longings. Licking pennies. Girl in Tranquilla convent
 17430	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat nun told me liked to smell rock oil. Virgins go mad in the end I
 17431	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuppose. Sister? How many women in Dublin have it today? Martha, she.
 17432	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSomething in the air. That’s the moon. But then why don’t all women
 17433	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmenstruate at the same time with the same moon, I mean? Depends on the
 17434	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttime they were born I suppose. Or all start scratch then get out of
 17435	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstep. Sometimes Molly and Milly together. Anyhow I got the best of that.
 17436	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDamned glad I didn’t do it in the bath this morning over her silly I
 17437	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twill punish you letter. Made up for that tramdriver this morning. That
 17438	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgouger M’Coy stopping me to say nothing. And his wife engagement in the
 17439	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcountry valise, voice like a pickaxe. Thankful for small mercies.
 17440	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCheap too. Yours for the asking. Because they want it themselves. Their
 17441	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnatural craving. Shoals of them every evening poured out of offices.
 17442	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tReserve better. Don’t want it they throw it at you. Catch em alive, O.
 17443	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPity they can’t see themselves. A dream of wellfilled hose. Where was
 17444	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat? Ah, yes. Mutoscope pictures in Capel street: for men only. Peeping
 17445	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTom. Willy’s hat and what the girls did with it. Do they snapshot those
 17446	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgirls or is it all a fake? Lingerie does it. Felt for the curves inside
 17447	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther déshabillé. Excites them also when they’re. I’m all clean come and
 17448	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdirty me. And they like dressing one another for the sacrifice. Milly
 17449	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdelighted with Molly’s new blouse. At first. Put them all on to take
 17450	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem all off. Molly. Why I bought her the violet garters. Us too: the
 17451	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttie he wore, his lovely socks and turnedup trousers. He wore a pair
 17452	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof gaiters the night that first we met. His lovely shirt was shining
 17453	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeneath his what? of jet. Say a woman loses a charm with every pin she
 17454	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttakes out. Pinned together. O, Mairy lost the pin of her. Dressed up to
 17455	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe nines for somebody. Fashion part of their charm. Just changes when
 17456	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou’re on the track of the secret. Except the east: Mary, Martha: now as
 17457	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthen. No reasonable offer refused. She wasn’t in a hurry either. Always
 17458	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\toff to a fellow when they are. They never forget an appointment. Out on
 17459	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspec probably. They believe in chance because like themselves. And the
 17460	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tothers inclined to give her an odd dig. Girl friends at school, arms
 17461	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tround each other’s necks or with ten fingers locked, kissing and
 17462	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhispering secrets about nothing in the convent garden. Nuns with
 17463	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhitewashed faces, cool coifs and their rosaries going up and down,
 17464	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvindictive too for what they can’t get. Barbed wire. Be sure now and
 17465	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twrite to me. And I’ll write to you. Now won’t you? Molly and Josie
 17466	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPowell. Till Mr Right comes along, then meet once in a blue moon.
 17467	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTableau! O, look who it is for the love of God! How are you at all? What
 17468	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thave you been doing with yourself? Kiss and delighted to, kiss, to see
 17469	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou. Picking holes in each other’s appearance. You’re looking splendid.
 17470	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSister souls. Showing their teeth at one another. How many have you
 17471	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tleft? Wouldn’t lend each other a pinch of salt.
 17472	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17473	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAh!
 17474	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17475	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDevils they are when that’s coming on them. Dark devilish appearance.
 17476	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMolly often told me feel things a ton weight. Scratch the sole of my
 17477	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfoot. O that way! O, that’s exquisite! Feel it myself too. Good to rest
 17478	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tonce in a way. Wonder if it’s bad to go with them then. Safe in one way.
 17479	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTurns milk, makes fiddlestrings snap. Something about withering plants I
 17480	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tread in a garden. Besides they say if the flower withers she wears she’s
 17481	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta flirt. All are. Daresay she felt I. When you feel like that you often
 17482	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmeet what you feel. Liked me or what? Dress they look at. Always know a
 17483	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfellow courting: collars and cuffs. Well cocks and lions do the same
 17484	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand stags. Same time might prefer a tie undone or something. Trousers?
 17485	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSuppose I when I was? No. Gently does it. Dislike rough and tumble. Kiss
 17486	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the dark and never tell. Saw something in me. Wonder what. Sooner
 17487	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thave me as I am than some poet chap with bearsgrease plastery hair,
 17488	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlovelock over his dexter optic. To aid gentleman in literary. Ought to
 17489	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tattend to my appearance my age. Didn’t let her see me in profile. Still,
 17490	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou never know. Pretty girls and ugly men marrying. Beauty and the
 17491	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeast. Besides I can’t be so if Molly. Took off her hat to show her
 17492	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thair. Wide brim. Bought to hide her face, meeting someone might know
 17493	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther, bend down or carry a bunch of flowers to smell. Hair strong in rut.
 17494	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTen bob I got for Molly’s combings when we were on the rocks in Holles
 17495	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstreet. Why not? Suppose he gave her money. Why not? All a prejudice.
 17496	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe’s worth ten, fifteen, more, a pound. What? I think so. All that for
 17497	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnothing. Bold hand: Mrs Marion. Did I forget to write address on
 17498	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat letter like the postcard I sent to Flynn? And the day I went to
 17499	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDrimmie’s without a necktie. Wrangle with Molly it was put me off. No,
 17500	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI remember. Richie Goulding: he’s another. Weighs on his mind. Funny
 17501	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmy watch stopped at half past four. Dust. Shark liver oil they use to
 17502	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tclean. Could do it myself. Save. Was that just when he, she?
 17503	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17504	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tO, he did. Into her. She did. Done.
 17505	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17506	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAh!
 17507	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17508	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom with careful hand recomposed his wet shirt. O Lord, that little
 17509	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlimping devil. Begins to feel cold and clammy. Aftereffect not pleasant.
 17510	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStill you have to get rid of it someway. They don’t care. Complimented
 17511	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tperhaps. Go home to nicey bread and milky and say night prayers with the
 17512	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tkiddies. Well, aren’t they? See her as she is spoil all. Must have the
 17513	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstage setting, the rouge, costume, position, music. The name too. Amours
 17514	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof actresses. Nell Gwynn, Mrs Bracegirdle, Maud Branscombe. Curtain
 17515	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tup. Moonlight silver effulgence. Maiden discovered with pensive bosom.
 17516	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLittle sweetheart come and kiss me. Still, I feel. The strength it gives
 17517	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta man. That’s the secret of it. Good job I let off there behind the wall
 17518	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcoming out of Dignam’s. Cider that was. Otherwise I couldn’t have. Makes
 17519	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou want to sing after. Lacaus esant taratara. Suppose I spoke to
 17520	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther. What about? Bad plan however if you don’t know how to end the
 17521	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconversation. Ask them a question they ask you another. Good idea if
 17522	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou’re stuck. Gain time. But then you’re in a cart. Wonderful of course
 17523	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tif you say: good evening, and you see she’s on for it: good evening. O
 17524	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbut the dark evening in the Appian way I nearly spoke to Mrs Clinch O
 17525	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthinking she was. Whew! Girl in Meath street that night. All the dirty
 17526	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthings I made her say. All wrong of course. My arks she called it. It’s
 17527	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tso hard to find one who. Aho! If you don’t answer when they solicit must
 17528	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbe horrible for them till they harden. And kissed my hand when I gave
 17529	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther the extra two shillings. Parrots. Press the button and the bird will
 17530	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsqueak. Wish she hadn’t called me sir. O, her mouth in the dark! And you
 17531	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta married man with a single girl! That’s what they enjoy. Taking a man
 17532	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom another woman. Or even hear of it. Different with me. Glad to get
 17533	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\taway from other chap’s wife. Eating off his cold plate. Chap in the
 17534	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBurton today spitting back gumchewed gristle. French letter still in
 17535	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmy pocketbook. Cause of half the trouble. But might happen sometime,
 17536	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI don’t think. Come in, all is prepared. I dreamt. What? Worst is
 17537	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeginning. How they change the venue when it’s not what they like. Ask
 17538	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou do you like mushrooms because she once knew a gentleman who. Or ask
 17539	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou what someone was going to say when he changed his mind and stopped.
 17540	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tYet if I went the whole hog, say: I want to, something like that.
 17541	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBecause I did. She too. Offend her. Then make it up. Pretend to want
 17542	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsomething awfully, then cry off for her sake. Flatters them. She must
 17543	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thave been thinking of someone else all the time. What harm? Must since
 17544	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshe came to the use of reason, he, he and he. First kiss does the trick.
 17545	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe propitious moment. Something inside them goes pop. Mushy like, tell
 17546	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby their eye, on the sly. First thoughts are best. Remember that till
 17547	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir dying day. Molly, lieutenant Mulvey that kissed her under the
 17548	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMoorish wall beside the gardens. Fifteen she told me. But her breasts
 17549	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere developed. Fell asleep then. After Glencree dinner that was when we
 17550	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdrove home. Featherbed mountain. Gnashing her teeth in sleep. Lord mayor
 17551	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad his eye on her too. Val Dillon. Apoplectic.
 17552	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17553	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThere she is with them down there for the fireworks. My fireworks. Up
 17554	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlike a rocket, down like a stick. And the children, twins they must
 17555	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbe, waiting for something to happen. Want to be grownups. Dressing in
 17556	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmother’s clothes. Time enough, understand all the ways of the world. And
 17557	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe dark one with the mop head and the nigger mouth. I knew she could
 17558	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhistle. Mouth made for that. Like Molly. Why that highclass whore in
 17559	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJammet’s wore her veil only to her nose. Would you mind, please, telling
 17560	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tme the right time? I’ll tell you the right time up a dark lane.
 17561	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSay prunes and prisms forty times every morning, cure for fat lips.
 17562	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCaressing the little boy too. Onlookers see most of the game. Of course
 17563	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey understand birds, animals, babies. In their line.
 17564	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17565	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDidn’t look back when she was going down the strand. Wouldn’t give that
 17566	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsatisfaction. Those girls, those girls, those lovely seaside girls. Fine
 17567	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\teyes she had, clear. It’s the white of the eye brings that out not so
 17568	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmuch the pupil. Did she know what I? Course. Like a cat sitting beyond
 17569	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta dog’s jump. Women never meet one like that Wilkins in the high school
 17570	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdrawing a picture of Venus with all his belongings on show. Call that
 17571	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinnocence? Poor idiot! His wife has her work cut out for her. Never see
 17572	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem sit on a bench marked Wet Paint. Eyes all over them. Look under
 17573	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe bed for what’s not there. Longing to get the fright of their lives.
 17574	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSharp as needles they are. When I said to Molly the man at the corner of
 17575	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCuffe street was goodlooking, thought she might like, twigged at once he
 17576	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad a false arm. Had, too. Where do they get that? Typist going up Roger
 17577	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGreene’s stairs two at a time to show her understandings. Handed down
 17578	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom father to, mother to daughter, I mean. Bred in the bone. Milly for
 17579	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\texample drying her handkerchief on the mirror to save the ironing. Best
 17580	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplace for an ad to catch a woman’s eye on a mirror. And when I sent
 17581	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther for Molly’s Paisley shawl to Prescott’s by the way that ad I must,
 17582	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcarrying home the change in her stocking! Clever little minx. I never
 17583	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttold her. Neat way she carries parcels too. Attract men, small thing
 17584	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlike that. Holding up her hand, shaking it, to let the blood flow back
 17585	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhen it was red. Who did you learn that from? Nobody. Something the
 17586	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnurse taught me. O, don’t they know! Three years old she was in front of
 17587	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMolly’s dressingtable, just before we left Lombard street west. Me have
 17588	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta nice pace. Mullingar. Who knows? Ways of the world. Young student.
 17589	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStraight on her pins anyway not like the other. Still she was game.
 17590	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLord, I am wet. Devil you are. Swell of her calf. Transparent stockings,
 17591	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstretched to breaking point. Not like that frump today. A. E. Rumpled
 17592	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstockings. Or the one in Grafton street. White. Wow! Beef to the heel.
 17593	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17594	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA monkey puzzle rocket burst, spluttering in darting crackles. Zrads and
 17595	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tzrads, zrads, zrads. And Cissy and Tommy and Jacky ran out to see and
 17596	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEdy after with the pushcar and then Gerty beyond the curve of the rocks.
 17597	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWill she? Watch! Watch! See! Looked round. She smelt an onion. Darling,
 17598	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI saw, your. I saw all.
 17599	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17600	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLord!
 17601	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17602	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDid me good all the same. Off colour after Kiernan’s, Dignam’s. For
 17603	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthis relief much thanks. In Hamlet, that is. Lord! It was all things
 17604	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcombined. Excitement. When she leaned back, felt an ache at the butt
 17605	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof my tongue. Your head it simply swirls. He’s right. Might have made a
 17606	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tworse fool of myself however. Instead of talking about nothing. Then
 17607	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI will tell you all. Still it was a kind of language between us. It
 17608	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcouldn’t be? No, Gerty they called her. Might be false name however like
 17609	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmy name and the address Dolphin’s barn a blind.
 17610	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17611	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t      Her maiden name was Jemina Brown
 17612	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t      And she lived with her mother in Irishtown.
 17613	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17614	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPlace made me think of that I suppose. All tarred with the same brush.
 17615	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWiping pens in their stockings. But the ball rolled down to her as if
 17616	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit understood. Every bullet has its billet. Course I never could throw
 17617	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanything straight at school. Crooked as a ram’s horn. Sad however
 17618	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbecause it lasts only a few years till they settle down to potwalloping
 17619	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand papa’s pants will soon fit Willy and fuller’s earth for the baby
 17620	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhen they hold him out to do ah ah. No soft job. Saves them. Keeps
 17621	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem out of harm’s way. Nature. Washing child, washing corpse. Dignam.
 17622	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tChildren’s hands always round them. Cocoanut skulls, monkeys, not even
 17623	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tclosed at first, sour milk in their swaddles and tainted curds. Oughtn’t
 17624	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto have given that child an empty teat to suck. Fill it up with wind.
 17625	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMrs Beaufoy, Purefoy. Must call to the hospital. Wonder is nurse Callan
 17626	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthere still. She used to look over some nights when Molly was in the
 17627	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCoffee Palace. That young doctor O’Hare I noticed her brushing his coat.
 17628	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd Mrs Breen and Mrs Dignam once like that too, marriageable. Worst
 17629	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof all at night Mrs Duggan told me in the City Arms. Husband rolling in
 17630	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdrunk, stink of pub off him like a polecat. Have that in your nose in
 17631	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe dark, whiff of stale boose. Then ask in the morning: was I drunk
 17632	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlast night? Bad policy however to fault the husband. Chickens come home
 17633	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto roost. They stick by one another like glue. Maybe the women’s fault
 17634	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\talso. That’s where Molly can knock spots off them. It’s the blood of the
 17635	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsouth. Moorish. Also the form, the figure. Hands felt for the opulent.
 17636	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJust compare for instance those others. Wife locked up at home, skeleton

 17650	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOther hand a sixfooter with a wifey up to his watchpocket. Long and

 17653	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinfluence between the person because that was about the time he. Yes, I
 17654	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuppose, at once. Cat’s away, the mice will play. I remember looking
 17655	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin Pill lane. Also that now is magnetism. Back of everything magnetism.
 17656	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEarth for instance pulling this and being pulled. That causes movement.
 17657	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd time, well that’s the time the movement takes. Then if one thing
 17658	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit. Because it’s all
 17659	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tarranged. Magnetic needle tells you what’s going on in the sun, the

 17670	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFine voice that fellow had. How Giuglini began. Smell that I did. Like
 17671	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tflowers. It was too. Violets. Came from the turpentine probably in the

 17677	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWait. Hm. Hm. Yes. That’s her perfume. Why she waved her hand. I leave

 17679	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHeliotrope? No. Hyacinth? Hm. Roses, I think. She’d like scent of that
 17680	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tkind. Sweet and cheap: soon sour. Why Molly likes opoponax. Suits her,
 17681	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith a little jessamine mixed. Her high notes and her low notes. At the
 17682	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdance night she met him, dance of the hours. Heat brought it out. She
 17683	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas wearing her black and it had the perfume of the time before. Good
 17684	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconductor, is it? Or bad? Light too. Suppose there’s some connection.
 17685	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFor instance if you go into a cellar where it’s dark. Mysterious thing
 17686	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttoo. Why did I smell it only now? Took its time in coming like herself,
 17687	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tslow but sure. Suppose it’s ever so many millions of tiny grains
 17688	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblown across. Yes, it is. Because those spice islands, Cinghalese this
 17689	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmorning, smell them leagues off. Tell you what it is. It’s like a fine
 17690	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfine veil or web they have all over the skin, fine like what do you
 17691	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcall it gossamer, and they’re always spinning it out of them, fine as

 17695	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin her shift on the bed. Know her smell in a thousand. Bathwater too.
 17696	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tReminds me of strawberries and cream. Wonder where it is really. There
 17697	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tor the armpits or under the neck. Because you get it out of all holes
 17698	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand corners. Hyacinth perfume made of oil of ether or something.
 17699	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMuskrat. Bag under their tails. One grain pour off odour for years. Dogs
 17700	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat each other behind. Good evening. Evening. How do you sniff? Hm. Hm.
 17701	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tVery well, thank you. Animals go by that. Yes now, look at it that way.
 17702	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWe’re the same. Some women, instance, warn you off when they have their

 17705	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 17706	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPerhaps they get a man smell off us. What though? Cigary gloves long

 17708	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat. No. Mansmell, I mean. Must be connected with that because priests

 18137	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdied and the nun answered him and said that he was died in Mona Island
 18138	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthrough bellycrab three year agone come Childermas and she prayed to God
 18139	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe Allruthful to have his dear soul in his undeathliness. He heard her
 18140	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsad words, in held hat sad staring. So stood they there both awhile in
 18141	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twanhope sorrowing one with other.
 18142	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 18143	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTherefore, everyman, look to that last end that is thy death and the
 18144	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdust that gripeth on every man that is born of woman for as he came
 18145	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnaked forth from his mother’s womb so naked shall he wend him at the
 18146	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlast for to go as he came.
 18147	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 18148	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe man that was come in to the house then spoke to the nursingwoman and
 18149	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in childbed.
 18150	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in throes
 18151	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnow full three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to bear
 18152	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbut that now in a little it would be. She said thereto that she had
 18153	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseen many births of women but never was none so hard as was that woman’s
 18154	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbirth. Then she set it all forth to him for because she knew the man
 18155	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat time was had lived nigh that house. The man hearkened to her words
 18156	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor he felt with wonder women’s woe in the travail that they have of
 18157	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmotherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair face for
 18158	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tany man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaid. Nine
 18159	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttwelve bloodflows chiding her childless.
 18160	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 18161	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there nighed
 18162	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat. And there came
 18163	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tagainst the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept Dixon. And
 18164	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe traveller Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they
 18165	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad had ado each with other in the house of misericord where this
 18166	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlearningknight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be
 18167	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thealed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a
 18168	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thorrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make
 18169	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice. And he
 18170	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaid now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with
 18171	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem that were there. And the traveller Leopold said that he should go
 18172	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\totherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile. Also the lady
 18173	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well
 18174	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility. But
 18175	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have
 18176	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvellous
 18177	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcastle. And the traveller Leopold went into the castle for to rest him
 18178	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers
 18179	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlands and sometime venery.
 18180	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 18181	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of Finlandy
 18182	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not
 18183	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmove more for enchantment. And on this board were frightful swords and
 18184	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white
 18185	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tflames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there
 18186	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabound marvellously. And there were vessels that are wrought by magic of
 18187	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he
 18188	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblases in to them like to bubbles. And full fair cheer and rich was on
 18189	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer. And there was
 18190	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay strange
 18191	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be possible
 18192	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthing without they see it natheless they are so. And these fishes lie
 18193	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin an oily water brought there from Portugal land because of the fatness
 18194	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat therein is like to the juices of the olivepress. And also it was
 18195	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of
 18196	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfecund wheatkidneys out of Chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits
 18197	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat they do in to it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain. And
 18198	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey teach the serpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks
 18199	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a
 18200	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrewage like to mead.
 18201	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 18202	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halp
 18203	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthereto the while all they that were there drank every each. And childe
 18204	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLeopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat
 18205	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and
 18206	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and
 18207	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this neighbour nist not of this wile. And he sat down in that castle with
 18208	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem for to rest him there awhile. Thanked be Almighty God.
 18209	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 18210	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThis meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at the
 18211	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\treverence of Jesu our alther liege Lord to leave their wassailing for
 18212	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthere was above one quick with child, a gentle dame, whose time hied
 18213	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfast. Sir Leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what
 18214	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcry that it was whether of child or woman and I marvel, said he, that it
 18215	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbe not come or now. Meseems it dureth overlong. And he was ware and saw
 18216	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta franklin that hight Lenehan on that side the table that was older than
 18217	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tany of the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the
 18218	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tone emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full
 18219	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgently. But, said he, or it be long too she will bring forth by God His
 18220	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbounty and have joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long.
 18221	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd the franklin that had drunken said, Expecting each moment to be her
 18222	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnext. Also he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never
 18223	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnone asking nor desiring of him to drink and, Now drink, said he, fully
 18224	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdelectably, and he quaffed as far as he might to their both’s health for
 18225	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the was a passing good man of his lustiness. And sir Leopold that was the
 18226	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgoodliest guest that ever sat in scholars’ hall and that was the meekest
 18227	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tman and the kindest that ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was
 18228	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe very truest knight of the world one that ever did minion service
 18229	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto lady gentle pledged him courtly in the cup. Woman’s woe with wonder
 18230	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpondering.
 18231	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 18232	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNow let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be
 18233	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdrunken an they might. There was a sort of scholars along either side
 18234	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe board, that is to wit, Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary Merciable’s
 18235	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith other his fellows Lynch and Madden, scholars of medicine, and the
 18236	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfranklin that hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa, one Crotthers, and
 18237	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyoung Stephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board
 18238	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand Costello that men clepen Punch Costello all long of a mastery of
 18239	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim erewhile gested (and of all them, reserved young Stephen, he was the
 18240	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmost drunken that demanded still of more mead) and beside the meek sir
 18241	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLeopold. But on young Malachi they waited for that he promised to have
 18242	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcome and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avow.
 18243	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir Simon
 18244	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand to this his son young Stephen and for that his languor becalmed him
 18245	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthere after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that
 18246	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttime in the honourablest manner. Ruth red him, love led on with will to
 18247	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twander, loth to leave.
 18248	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 18249	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFor they were right witty scholars. And he heard their aresouns each gen
 18250	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tother as touching birth and righteousness, young Madden maintaining that
 18251	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tput such case it were hard the wife to die (for so it had fallen out a
 18252	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmatter of some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Horne’s house that
 18253	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnow was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her
 18254	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdeath all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case). And
 18255	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey said farther she should live because in the beginning, they said,
 18256	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of
 18257	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthis imagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for he had
 18258	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconscience to let her die. And not few and of these was young Lynch
 18259	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never
 18260	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tother howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his
 18261	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjudges did provide no remedy. A redress God grant. This was scant said
 18262	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbut all cried with one acclaim nay, by our Virgin Mother, the wife
 18263	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshould live and the babe to die. In colour whereof they waxed hot
 18264	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tupon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the
 18265	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfranklin Lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the
 18266	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tleast way mirth might not lack. Then young Madden showed all the whole
 18267	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\taffair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake by
 18268	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to Saint Ultan of
 18269	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tArbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were
 18270	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall wondrous grieved. To whom young Stephen had these words following:
 18271	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMurmur, sirs, is eke oft among lay folk. Both babe and parent now
 18272	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglorify their Maker, the one in limbo gloom, the other in purgefire.
 18273	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut, gramercy, what of those Godpossibled souls that we nightly
 18274	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\timpossibilise, which is the sin against the Holy Ghost, Very God, Lord
 18275	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand Giver of Life? For, sirs, he said, our lust is brief. We are means
 18276	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto those small creatures within us and nature has other ends than we.
 18277	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThen said Dixon junior to Punch Costello wist he what ends. But he had
 18278	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tovermuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he
 18279	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if
 18280	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead. Whereat
 18281	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCrotthers of Alba Longa sang young Malachi’s praise of that beast the
 18282	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn, the other all
 18283	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthis while, pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice
 18284	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim, witnessing all and several by saint Foutinus his engines that
 18285	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do. Thereat
 18286	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlaughed they all right jocundly only young Stephen and sir Leopold which
 18287	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnever durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would
 18288	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnot bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might
 18289	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbe or wheresoever. Then spake young Stephen orgulous of mother Church
 18290	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat would cast him out of her bosom, of law of canons, of Lilith,
 18291	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpatron of abortions, of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness
 18292	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tor by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or, as Virgilius saith, by the
 18293	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinfluence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or an she
 18294	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlie with a woman which her man has but lain with, effectu secuto, or
 18295	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tperadventure in her bath according to the opinions of Averroes and Moses
 18296	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMaimonides. He said also how at the end of the second month a human soul
 18297	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for God’s
 18298	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgreater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bear
 18299	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fisherman’s
 18300	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseal, even that blessed Peter on which rock was holy church for all ages
 18301	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfounded. All they bachelors then asked of sir Leopold would he in like
 18302	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcase so jeopard her person as risk life to save life. A wariness of
 18303	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmind he would answer as fitted all and, laying hand to jaw, he said
 18304	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdissembling, as his wont was, that as it was informed him, who had ever
 18305	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tloved the art of physic as might a layman, and agreeing also with his
 18306	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\texperience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that mother
 18307	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tChurch belike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort
 18308	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdeliverly he scaped their questions. That is truth, pardy, said Dixon,
 18309	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand, or I err, a pregnant word. Which hearing young Stephen was a
 18310	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmarvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor
 18311	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlendeth to the Lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and
 18312	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons.
 18313	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 18314	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had
 18315	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour
 18316	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand as he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only
 18317	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmanchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art
 18318	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcould save so dark is destiny. And she was wondrous stricken of heart
 18319	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of
 18320	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlamb’s wool, the flower of the flock, lest he might perish utterly and
 18321	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlie akeled (for it was then about the midst of the winter) and now sir
 18322	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLeopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his
 18323	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfriend’s son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and
 18324	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage (for all
 18325	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\taccounted him of real parts) so grieved he also in no less measure
 18326	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor young Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and
 18327	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmurdered his goods with whores.
 18328	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 18329	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAbout that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood empty
 18330	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tso as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed
 18331	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir approach from him that still plied it very busily who, praying for
 18332	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe intentions of the sovereign pontiff, he gave them for a pledge the
 18333	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvicar of Christ which also as he said is vicar of Bray. Now drink we,
 18334	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tquod he, of this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed parcel
 18335	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof my body but my soul’s bodiment. Leave ye fraction of bread to them
 18336	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat live by bread alone. Be not afeard neither for any want for this
 18337	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twill comfort more than the other will dismay. See ye here. And he showed
 18338	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the worth of
 18339	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttwo pound nineteen shilling that he had, he said, for a song which he
 18340	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twrit. They all admired to see the foresaid riches in such dearth of
 18341	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmoney as was herebefore. His words were then these as followeth: Know
 18342	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall men, he said, time’s ruins build eternity’s mansions. What means
 18343	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthis? Desire’s wind blasts the thorntree but after it becomes from a
 18344	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbramblebush to be a rose upon the rood of time. Mark me now. In woman’s
 18345	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twomb word is made flesh but in the spirit of the maker all flesh
 18346	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat passes becomes the word that shall not pass away. This is the
 18347	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpostcreation. Omnis caro ad te veniet. No question but her name is
 18348	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpuissant who aventried the dear corse of our Agenbuyer, Healer and Herd,
 18349	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tour mighty mother and mother most venerable and Bernardus saith aptly
 18350	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat She hath an omnipotentiam deiparae supplicem, that is to wit, an
 18351	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\talmightiness of petition because she is the second Eve and she won
 18352	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tus, saith Augustine too, whereas that other, our grandam, which we are
 18353	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlinked up with by successive anastomosis of navelcords sold us all,

 18355	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnow. Or she knew him, that second I say, and was but creature of her
 18356	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcreature, vergine madre, figlia di tuo figlio, or she knew him not and
 18357	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthen stands she in the one denial or ignorancy with Peter Piscator who

 18362	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconsubstantiality but in no case subsubstantiality. And all cried out
 18363	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tupon it for a very scurvy word. A pregnancy without joy, he said, a
 18364	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbirth without pangs, a body without blemish, a belly without bigness.
 18365	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLet the lewd with faith and fervour worship. With will will we

 18368	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHereupon Punch Costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would

 18470	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat hist his heart. And Master Lynch bade him have a care to flout and
 18471	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twitwanton as the god self was angered for his hellprate and paganry. And
 18472	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed wan as they might all
 18473	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmark and shrank together and his pitch that was before so haught uplift
 18474	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart shook within the
 18475	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that storm. Then did some
 18476	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmock and some jeer and Punch Costello fell hard again to his yale which
 18477	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMaster Lenehan vowed he would do after and he was indeed but a word and
 18478	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta blow on any the least colour. But the braggart boaster cried that an
 18479	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\told Nobodaddy was in his cups it was muchwhat indifferent and he would
 18480	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnot lag behind his lead. But this was only to dye his desperation as
 18481	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcowed he crouched in Horne’s hall. He drank indeed at one draught to

 18483	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe heavens so that Master Madden, being godly certain whiles, knocked
 18484	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim on his ribs upon that crack of doom and Master Bloom, at the
 18485	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbraggart’s side, spoke to him calming words to slumber his great fear,
 18486	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tadvertising how it was no other thing but a hubbub noise that he heard,
 18487	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe discharge of fluid from the thunderhead, look you, having taken

 18489	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 18490	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut was young Boasthard’s fear vanquished by Calmer’s words? No, for he
 18491	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad in his bosom a spike named Bitterness which could not by words be
 18492	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdone away. And was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the
 18493	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tother? He was neither as much as he would have liked to be either. But
 18494	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcould he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the
 18495	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbottle Holiness that then he lived withal? Indeed no for Grace was not
 18496	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthere to find that bottle. Heard he then in that clap the voice of the
 18497	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgod Bringforth or, what Calmer said, a hubbub of Phenomenon? Heard?
 18498	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhy, he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube
 18499	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tUnderstanding (which he had not done). For through that tube he saw that
 18500	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the was in the land of Phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die
 18501	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas he was like the rest too a passing show. And would he not accept to
 18502	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdie like the rest and pass away? By no means would he though he must nor
 18503	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould he make more shows according as men do with wives which Phenomenon
 18504	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thas commanded them to do by the book Law. Then wotted he nought of that
 18505	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tother land which is called Believe-on-Me, that is the land of promise
 18506	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhich behoves to the king Delightful and shall be for ever where there
 18507	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tis no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering at which all shall
 18508	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcome as many as believe on it? Yes, Pious had told him of that land and
 18509	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tChaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he
 18510	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing exterior whose name, she
 18511	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaid, is Bird-in-the-Hand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true
 18512	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpath by her flatteries that she said to him as, Ho, you pretty man, turn
 18513	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\taside hither and I will show you a brave place, and she lay at him so
 18514	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tflatteringly that she had him in her grot which is named Two-in-the-Bush

 18519	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBird-in-the-Hand (which was within all foul plagues, monsters and a
 18520	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twicked devil) they would strain the last but they would make at her and
 18521	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknow her. For regarding Believe-on-Me they said it was nought else
 18522	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbut notion and they could conceive no thought of it for, first,

 18614	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this name), ‘tis all about Kerry cows that are to be butchered along of
 18615	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe plague. But they can go hang, says he with a wink, for me with their
 18616	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbully beef, a pox on it. There’s as good fish in this tin as ever came
 18617	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout of it and very friendly he offered to take of some salty sprats that
 18618	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstood by which he had eyed wishly in the meantime and found the place
 18619	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhich was indeed the chief design of his embassy as he was sharpset.
 18620	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMort aux vaches, says Frank then in the French language that had been
 18621	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tindentured to a brandyshipper that has a winelodge in Bordeaux and he
 18622	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspoke French like a gentleman too. From a child this Frank had been
 18623	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta donought that his father, a headborough, who could ill keep him to
 18624	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tschool to learn his letters and the use of the globes, matriculated at
 18625	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe university to study the mechanics but he took the bit between his
 18626	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tteeth like a raw colt and was more familiar with the justiciary and the
 18627	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tparish beadle than with his volumes. One time he would be a playactor,
 18628	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthen a sutler or a welsher, then nought would keep him from the bearpit
 18629	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand the cocking main, then he was for the ocean sea or to hoof it on
 18630	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe roads with the romany folk, kidnapping a squire’s heir by favour of
 18631	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmoonlight or fecking maids’ linen or choking chicken behind a hedge. He
 18632	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad been off as many times as a cat has lives and back again with naked
 18633	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpockets as many more to his father the headborough who shed a pint
 18634	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof tears as often as he saw him. What, says Mr Leopold with his hands
 18635	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tacross, that was earnest to know the drift of it, will they slaughter
 18636	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall? I protest I saw them but this day morning going to the Liverpool
 18637	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tboats, says he. I can scarce believe ‘tis so bad, says he. And he had
 18638	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\texperience of the like brood beasts and of springers, greasy hoggets and
 18639	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twether wool, having been some years before actuary for Mr Joseph Cuffe,
 18640	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock and meadow
 18641	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tauctions hard by Mr Gavin Low’s yard in Prussia street. I question with
 18642	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou there, says he. More like ‘tis the hoose or the timber tongue. Mr
 18643	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen, a little moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and
 18644	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat he had dispatches from the emperor’s chief tailtickler thanking
 18645	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim for the hospitality, that was sending over Doctor Rinderpest, the
 18646	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbestquoted cowcatcher in all Muscovy, with a bolus or two of physic to
 18647	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttake the bull by the horns. Come, come, says Mr Vincent, plain dealing.
 18648	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe’ll find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a
 18649	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbull that’s Irish, says he. Irish by name and irish by nature, says Mr
 18650	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen, and he sent the ale purling about, an Irish bull in an English
 18651	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchinashop. I conceive you, says Mr Dixon. It is that same bull that was
 18652	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsent to our island by farmer Nicholas, the bravest cattlebreeder of them
 18653	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall, with an emerald ring in his nose. True for you, says Mr Vincent
 18654	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcross the table, and a bullseye into the bargain, says he, and a plumper
 18655	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand a portlier bull, says he, never shit on shamrock. He had horns
 18656	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgalore, a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of
 18657	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this nostrils so that the women of our island, leaving doughballs and
 18658	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trollingpins, followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains.
 18659	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhat for that, says Mr Dixon, but before he came over farmer Nicholas
 18660	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who
 18661	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere no better off than himself. So be off now, says he, and do all my
 18662	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmer’s blessing, and
 18663	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith that he slapped his posteriors very soundly. But the slap and the
 18664	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblessing stood him friend, says Mr Vincent, for to make up he taught him
 18665	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta trick worth two of the other so that maid, wife, abbess and widow to
 18666	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthis day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper
 18667	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his
 18668	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlong holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in
 18669	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe four fields of all Ireland. Another then put in his word: And they
 18670	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdressed him, says he, in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and
 18671	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgirdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him
 18672	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of
 18673	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market
 18674	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tso that he could doss and dung to his heart’s content. By this time the
 18675	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfather of the faithful (for so they called him) was grown so heavy that
 18676	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the could scarce walk to pasture. To remedy which our cozening dames and
 18677	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdamsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his
 18678	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbelly was full he would rear up on his hind quarters to show their
 18679	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls’ language
 18680	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand they all after him. Ay, says another, and so pampered was he that he
 18681	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself
 18682	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t(for that was the only colour to his mind) and there was a board put up
 18683	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice, saying:
 18684	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBy the Lord Harry, Green is the grass that grows on the ground. And,
 18685	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsays Mr Dixon, if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in Roscommon or
 18686	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe wilds of Connemara or a husbandman in Sligo that was sowing as much
 18687	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he’d run amok over half
 18688	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all
 18689	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby lord Harry’s orders. There was bad blood between them at first, says
 18690	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Vincent, and the lord Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks
 18691	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house
 18692	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand I’ll meddle in his matters, says he. I’ll make that animal smell
 18693	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thell, says he, with the help of that good pizzle my father left me. But
 18694	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tone evening, says Mr Dixon, when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal
 18695	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace (he had spade oars for
 18696	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thimself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row
 18697	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith pitchforks) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull
 18698	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry
 18699	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous
 18700	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchampion bull of the Romans, Bos Bovum, which is good bog Latin for boss
 18701	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the show. After that, says Mr Vincent, the lord Harry put his head
 18702	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinto a cow’s drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and
 18703	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpulling it out again told them all his new name. Then, with the water
 18704	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trunning off him, he got into an old smock and skirt that had belonged to
 18705	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls’ language to study
 18706	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbut he could never learn a word of it except the first personal pronoun
 18707	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhich he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for
 18708	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what took his
 18709	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfancy, the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of cotton or
 18710	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta corkfloat. In short, he and the bull of Ireland were soon as fast
 18711	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfriends as an arse and a shirt. They were, says Mr Stephen, and the end
 18712	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas that the men of the island seeing no help was toward, as the ungrate
 18713	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twomen were all of one mind, made a wherry raft, loaded themselves and
 18714	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir bundles of chattels on shipboard, set all masts erect, manned the
 18715	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyards, sprang their luff, heaved to, spread three sheets in the wind,
 18716	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tput her head between wind and water, weighed anchor, ported her helm,
 18717	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tran up the jolly Roger, gave three times three, let the bullgine run,
 18718	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpushed off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of
 18719	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAmerica. Which was the occasion, says Mr Vincent, of the composing by a
 18720	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tboatswain of that rollicking chanty:
 18721	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 18722	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     —Pope Peter’s but a pissabed.
 18723	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     A man’s a man for a’ that.
 18724	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 18725	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOur worthy acquaintance Mr Malachi Mulligan now appeared in the doorway
 18726	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend
 18727	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhom he had just rencountered, a young gentleman, his name Alec Bannon,
 18728	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twho had late come to town, it being his intention to buy a colour or a
 18729	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars. Mr Mulligan was civil
 18730	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tenough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a
 18731	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tproject of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched
 18732	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton. Whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards
 18733	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhich he had had printed that day at Mr Quinnell’s bearing a legend
 18734	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprinted in fair italics: Mr Malachi Mulligan. Fertiliser and Incubator.
 18735	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLambay Island. His project, as he went on to expound, was to withdraw
 18736	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir
 18737	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFopling Popinjay and sir Milksop Quidnunc in town and to devote himself
 18738	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed. Well,
 18739	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlet us hear of it, good my friend, said Mr Dixon. I make no doubt it
 18740	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsmacks of wenching. Come, be seated, both. ‘Tis as cheap sitting as
 18741	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstanding. Mr Mulligan accepted of the invitation and, expatiating upon
 18742	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this design, told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by
 18743	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta consideration of the causes of sterility, both the inhibitory and the
 18744	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprohibitory, whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal
 18745	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the
 18746	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities
 18747	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tacquired. It grieved him plaguily, he said, to see the nuptial couch
 18748	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdefrauded of its dearest pledges: and to reflect upon so many agreeable
 18749	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfemales with rich jointures, a prey to the vilest bonzes, who hide their
 18750	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tflambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly
 18751	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might
 18752	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmultiply the inlets of happiness, sacrificing the inestimable jewel of
 18753	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress, this, he
 18754	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tassured them, made his heart weep. To curb this inconvenient (which
 18755	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the concluded due to a suppression of latent heat), having advised with
 18756	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcertain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter, he had
 18757	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tresolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of Lambay
 18758	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tisland from its holder, lord Talbot de Malahide, a Tory gentleman of
 18759	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnote much in favour with our ascendancy party. He proposed to set up
 18760	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthere a national fertilising farm to be named Omphalos with an obelisk
 18761	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thewn and erected after the fashion of Egypt and to offer his dutiful
 18762	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life
 18763	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsoever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the
 18764	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfunctions of her natural. Money was no object, he said, nor would he
 18765	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttake a penny for his pains. The poorest kitchenwench no less than the
 18766	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\topulent lady of fashion, if so be their constructions and their tempers
 18767	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere warm persuaders for their petitions, would find in him their man.
 18768	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFor his nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a
 18769	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdiet of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there, the flesh of these
 18770	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlatter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose, both
 18771	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbroiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum
 18772	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchillies. After this homily which he delivered with much warmth of
 18773	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tasseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with
 18774	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhich he had shielded it. They both, it seems, had been overtaken by the
 18775	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\train and for all their mending their pace had taken water, as might be
 18776	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tobserved by Mr Mulligan’s smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now
 18777	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsomewhat piebald. His project meanwhile was very favourably entertained
 18778	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though Mr Dixon of
 18779	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMary’s excepted to it, asking with a finicking air did he purpose also
 18780	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto carry coals to Newcastle. Mr Mulligan however made court to the
 18781	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tscholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which, as it dwelt
 18782	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tupon his memory, seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his
 18783	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcontention: Talis ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi, O quirites,
 18784	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tut matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici
 18785	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttitillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus
 18786	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcenturionum Romanorum magnopere anteponunt, while for those of ruder wit
 18787	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more suitable
 18788	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto their stomach, the buck and doe of the forest glade, the farmyard
 18789	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdrake and duck.
 18790	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 18791	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tValuing himself not a little upon his elegance, being indeed a proper
 18792	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tman of person, this talkative now applied himself to his dress with
 18793	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanimadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics
 18794	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhile the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had
 18795	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tadvanced. The young gentleman, his friend, overjoyed as he was at a
 18796	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpassage that had late befallen him, could not forbear to tell it his
 18797	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnearest neighbour. Mr Mulligan, now perceiving the table, asked for whom
 18798	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere those loaves and fishes and, seeing the stranger, he made him
 18799	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta civil bow and said, Pray, sir, was you in need of any professional
 18800	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tassistance we could give? Who, upon his offer, thanked him very
 18801	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\theartily, though preserving his proper distance, and replied that he was
 18802	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcome there about a lady, now an inmate of Horne’s house, that was in an
 18803	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinteresting condition, poor body, from woman’s woe (and here he fetched
 18804	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta deep sigh) to know if her happiness had yet taken place. Mr Dixon,
 18805	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto turn the table, took on to ask of Mr Mulligan himself whether
 18806	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this incipient ventripotence, upon which he rallied him, betokened an
 18807	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due,
 18808	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas with the noted physician, Mr Austin Meldon, to a wolf in the stomach.
 18809	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFor answer Mr Mulligan, in a gale of laughter at his smalls, smote
 18810	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thimself bravely below the diaphragm, exclaiming with an admirable droll
 18811	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmimic of Mother Grogan (the most excellent creature of her sex though
 18812	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t‘tis pity she’s a trollop): There’s a belly that never bore a bastard.
 18813	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThis was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw
 18814	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe whole room into the most violent agitations of delight. The spry
 18815	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the
 18816	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tantechamber.
 18817	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 18818	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHere the listener who was none other than the Scotch student, a little
 18819	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfume of a fellow, blond as tow, congratulated in the liveliest fashion
 18820	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith the young gentleman and, interrupting the narrative at a salient
 18821	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpoint, having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the
 18822	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tobligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by
 18823	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta questioning poise of the head (a whole century of polite breeding had
 18824	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnot achieved so nice a gesture) to which was united an equivalent but
 18825	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcontrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever
 18826	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdone in words if he might treat him with a cup of it. Mais bien sûr,
 18827	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnoble stranger, said he cheerily, et mille compliments. That you may
 18828	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand very opportunely. There wanted nothing but this cup to crown my
 18829	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfelicity. But, gracious heaven, was I left with but a crust in my wallet
 18830	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand a cupful of water from the well, my God, I would accept of them and
 18831	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfind it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to
 18832	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the Giver of good
 18833	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthings. With these words he approached the goblet to his lips, took a
 18834	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcomplacent draught of the cordial, slicked his hair and, opening his
 18835	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbosom, out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband, that very
 18836	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpicture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein.
 18837	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGazing upon those features with a world of tenderness, Ah, Monsieur, he
 18838	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaid, had you but beheld her as I did with these eyes at that affecting
 18839	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinstant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap (a gift for her
 18840	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfeastday as she told me prettily) in such an artless disorder, of so
 18841	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmelting a tenderness, ‘pon my conscience, even you, Monsieur, had been
 18842	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\timpelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of
 18843	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuch an enemy or to quit the field for ever. I declare, I was never so
 18844	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttouched in all my life. God, I thank thee, as the Author of my days!
 18845	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her
 18846	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfavours. A sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and, having
 18847	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\treplaced the locket in his bosom, he wiped his eye and sighed again.
 18848	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBeneficent Disseminator of blessings to all Thy creatures, how great

 18856	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseven showers, we were neither of us a penny the worse. But beshrew me,

 18863	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the town), is my authority that in Cape Horn, ventre biche, they have
 18864	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta rain that will wet through any, even the stoutest cloak. A drenching
 18865	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof that violence, he tells me, sans blague, has sent more than one
 18866	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tluckless fellow in good earnest posthaste to another world. Pooh! A
 18867	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlivre! cries Monsieur Lynch. The clumsy things are dear at a sou. One
 18868	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tumbrella, were it no bigger than a fairy mushroom, is worth ten such
 18869	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstopgaps. No woman of any wit would wear one. My dear Kitty told me

 18872	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhispering in my ear though there was none to snap her words but giddy
 18873	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbutterflies), dame Nature, by the divine blessing, has implanted it in

 18878	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttilbury, to fix my attention, gently tipped with her tongue the outer
 18879	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchamber of my ear), the first is a bath... But at this point a bell
 18880	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttinkling in the hall cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for
 18881	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe enrichment of our store of knowledge.
 18882	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 18883	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAmid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and, while
 18884	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall were conjecturing what might be the cause, Miss Callan entered and,
 18885	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thaving spoken a few words in a low tone to young Mr Dixon, retired with
 18886	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta profound bow to the company. The presence even for a moment among a
 18887	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tparty of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and
 18888	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnot less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of
 18889	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of
 18890	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tribaldry. Strike me silly, said Costello, a low fellow who was fuddled.
 18891	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA monstrous fine bit of cowflesh! I’ll be sworn she has rendezvoused

 18895	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchin. As I look to be saved I had it from my Kitty who has been wardmaid
 18896	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthere any time these seven months. Lawksamercy, doctor, cried the young
 18897	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblood in the primrose vest, feigning a womanish simper and with immodest
 18898	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsquirmings of his body, how you do tease a body! Drat the man! Bless
 18899	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tme, I’m all of a wibbly wobbly. Why, you’re as bad as dear little Father
 18900	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCantekissem, that you are! May this pot of four half choke me, cried
 18901	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCostello, if she aint in the family way. I knows a lady what’s got a

 18903	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just
 18904	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthen informed him that he was needed in the ward. Merciful providence
 18905	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad been pleased to put a period to the sufferings of the lady who was
 18906	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tenceinte which she had borne with a laudable fortitude and she had
 18907	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgiven birth to a bouncing boy. I want patience, said he, with those
 18908	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twho, without wit to enliven or learning to instruct, revile an ennobling
 18909	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprofession which, saving the reverence due to the Deity, is the greatest
 18910	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpower for happiness upon the earth. I am positive when I say that if
 18911	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tneed were I could produce a cloud of witnesses to the excellence of
 18912	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther noble exercitations which, so far from being a byword, should be a
 18913	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglorious incentive in the human breast. I cannot away with them. What?
 18914	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMalign such an one, the amiable Miss Callan, who is the lustre of
 18915	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther own sex and the astonishment of ours? And at an instant the most
 18916	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmomentous that can befall a puny child of clay? Perish the thought! I
 18917	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshudder to think of the future of a race where the seeds of such malice
 18918	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thave been sown and where no right reverence is rendered to mother and
 18919	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmaid in house of Horne. Having delivered himself of this rebuke he
 18920	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaluted those present on the by and repaired to the door. A murmur
 18921	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof approval arose from all and some were for ejecting the low soaker
 18922	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twithout more ado, a design which would have been effected nor would
 18923	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the have received more than his bare deserts had he not abridged his
 18924	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttransgression by affirming with a horrid imprecation (for he swore a
 18925	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tround hand) that he was as good a son of the true fold as ever drew
 18926	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbreath. Stap my vitals, said he, them was always the sentiments of
 18927	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thonest Frank Costello which I was bred up most particular to honour thy
 18928	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfather and thy mother that had the best hand to a rolypoly or a hasty

 18932	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsome impudent mocks which he however had borne with as being the fruits
 18933	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof that age upon which it is commonly charged that it knows not
 18934	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpity. The young sparks, it is true, were as full of extravagancies
 18935	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas overgrown children: the words of their tumultuary discussions
 18936	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere difficultly understood and not often nice: their testiness and
 18937	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\toutrageous mots were such that his intellects resiled from: nor were
 18938	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of
 18939	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstrong animal spirits spoke in their behalf. But the word of Mr Costello
 18940	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas an unwelcome language for him for he nauseated the wretch that
 18941	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseemed to him a cropeared creature of a misshapen gibbosity, born out
 18942	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof wedlock and thrust like a crookback toothed and feet first into the
 18943	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tworld, which the dint of the surgeon’s pliers in his skull lent indeed
 18944	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta colour to, so as to put him in thought of that missing link of
 18945	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcreation’s chain desiderated by the late ingenious Mr Darwin. It was now
 18946	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had passed
 18947	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthrough the thousand vicissitudes of existence and, being of a wary
 18948	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tascendancy and self a man of rare forecast, he had enjoined his heart
 18949	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto repress all motions of a rising choler and, by intercepting them
 18950	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith the readiest precaution, foster within his breast that plenitude
 18951	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof sufferance which base minds jeer at, rash judgers scorn and all find
 18952	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttolerable and but tolerable. To those who create themselves wits at the
 18953	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcost of feminine delicacy (a habit of mind which he never did hold
 18954	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith) to them he would concede neither to bear the name nor to herit
 18955	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe tradition of a proper breeding: while for such that, having lost
 18956	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall forbearance, can lose no more, there remained the sharp antidote of
 18957	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\texperience to cause their insolency to beat a precipitate and inglorious
 18958	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tretreat. Not but what he could feel with mettlesome youth which, caring
 18959	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnought for the mows of dotards or the gruntlings of the severe, is ever
 18960	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t(as the chaste fancy of the Holy Writer expresses it) for eating of the
 18961	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttree forbid it yet not so far forth as to pretermit humanity upon any
 18962	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcondition soever towards a gentlewoman when she was about her lawful
 18963	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\toccasions. To conclude, while from the sister’s words he had reckoned
 18964	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tupon a speedy delivery he was, however, it must be owned, not a little
 18965	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\talleviated by the intelligence that the issue so auspicated after an
 18966	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tordeal of such duress now testified once more to the mercy as well as to
 18967	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe bounty of the Supreme Being.
 18968	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 18969	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAccordingly he broke his mind to his neighbour, saying that, to express
 18970	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this notion of the thing, his opinion (who ought not perchance to express
 18971	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tone) was that one must have a cold constitution and a frigid genius not
 18972	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto be rejoiced by this freshest news of the fruition of her confinement
 18973	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsince she had been in such pain through no fault of hers. The dressy
 18974	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyoung blade said it was her husband’s that put her in that expectation
 18975	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tor at least it ought to be unless she were another Ephesian matron. I
 18976	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmust acquaint you, said Mr Crotthers, clapping on the table so as to
 18977	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tevoke a resonant comment of emphasis, old Glory Allelujurum was round
 18978	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tagain today, an elderly man with dundrearies, preferring through his
 18979	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnose a request to have word of Wilhelmina, my life, as he calls her. I
 18980	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbade him hold himself in readiness for that the event would burst anon.
 18981	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t‘Slife, I’ll be round with you. I cannot but extol the virile potency of
 18982	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe old bucko that could still knock another child out of her. All fell
 18983	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto praising of it, each after his own fashion, though the same young
 18984	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblade held with his former view that another than her conjugial had
 18985	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeen the man in the gap, a clerk in orders, a linkboy (virtuous) or
 18986	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tan itinerant vendor of articles needed in every household. Singular,
 18987	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcommuned the guest with himself, the wonderfully unequal faculty of
 18988	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmetempsychosis possessed by them, that the puerperal dormitory and the
 18989	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdissecting theatre should be the seminaries of such frivolity, that the
 18990	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmere acquisition of academic titles should suffice to transform in a
 18991	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpinch of time these votaries of levity into exemplary practitioners of
 18992	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tan art which most men anywise eminent have esteemed the noblest. But,
 18993	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the further added, it is mayhap to relieve the pentup feelings that in
 18994	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcommon oppress them for I have more than once observed that birds of a
 18995	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfeather laugh together.
 18996	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 18997	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut with what fitness, let it be asked of the noble lord, his patron,
 18998	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thas this alien, whom the concession of a gracious prince has admitted
 18999	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto civic rights, constituted himself the lord paramount of our
 19000	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinternal polity? Where is now that gratitude which loyalty should have
 19001	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcounselled? During the recent war whenever the enemy had a temporary
 19002	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tadvantage with his granados did this traitor to his kind not seize that
 19003	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmoment to discharge his piece against the empire of which he is a tenant
 19004	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat will while he trembled for the security of his four per cents? Has he
 19005	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tforgotten this as he forgets all benefits received? Or is it that from
 19006	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeing a deluder of others he has become at last his own dupe as he is,
 19007	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tif report belie him not, his own and his only enjoyer? Far be it from
 19008	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcandour to violate the bedchamber of a respectable lady, the daughter of
 19009	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta gallant major, or to cast the most distant reflections upon her
 19010	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvirtue but if he challenges attention there (as it was indeed highly his
 19011	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinterest not to have done) then be it so. Unhappy woman, she has been
 19012	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttoo long and too persistently denied her legitimate prerogative to
 19013	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlisten to his objurgations with any other feeling than the derision of
 19014	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe desperate. He says this, a censor of morals, a very pelican in his
 19015	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpiety, who did not scruple, oblivious of the ties of nature, to attempt
 19016	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tillicit intercourse with a female domestic drawn from the lowest strata
 19017	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof society! Nay, had the hussy’s scouringbrush not been her tutelary
 19018	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tangel, it had gone with her as hard as with Hagar, the Egyptian! In the
 19019	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tquestion of the grazing lands his peevish asperity is notorious and in
 19020	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Cuffe’s hearing brought upon him from an indignant rancher a scathing
 19021	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tretort couched in terms as straightforward as they were bucolic. It ill
 19022	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbecomes him to preach that gospel. Has he not nearer home a seedfield
 19023	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat lies fallow for the want of the ploughshare? A habit reprehensible
 19024	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat puberty is second nature and an opprobrium in middle life. If he must
 19025	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdispense his balm of Gilead in nostrums and apothegms of dubious taste
 19026	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto restore to health a generation of unfledged profligates let his
 19027	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpractice consist better with the doctrines that now engross him. His
 19028	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmarital breast is the repository of secrets which decorum is reluctant
 19029	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto adduce. The lewd suggestions of some faded beauty may console him for
 19030	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta consort neglected and debauched but this new exponent of morals and
 19031	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thealer of ills is at his best an exotic tree which, when rooted in
 19032	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tits native orient, throve and flourished and was abundant in balm
 19033	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbut, transplanted to a clime more temperate, its roots have lost their
 19034	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tquondam vigour while the stuff that comes away from it is stagnant, acid

 19046	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpalliate a licence which the simultaneous absence of abigail and
 19047	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tobstetrician rendered the easier, broke out at once into a strife of
 19048	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttongues. In vain the voice of Mr Canvasser Bloom was heard endeavouring
 19049	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto urge, to mollify, to refrain. The moment was too propitious for the
 19050	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdisplay of that discursiveness which seemed the only bond of union among
 19051	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttempers so divergent. Every phase of the situation was successively
 19052	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\teviscerated: the prenatal repugnance of uterine brothers, the Caesarean
 19053	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsection, posthumity with respect to the father and, that rarer form,
 19054	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith respect to the mother, the fratricidal case known as the Childs
 19055	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMurder and rendered memorable by the impassioned plea of Mr Advocate

 19094	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto us in the pages of his Metamorphoses. The impression made by his
 19095	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twords was immediate but shortlived. It was effaced as easily as it had
 19096	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeen evoked by an allocution from Mr Candidate Mulligan in that vein of
 19097	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpleasantry which none better than he knew how to affect, postulating as
 19098	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe supremest object of desire a nice clean old man. Contemporaneously,
 19099	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta heated argument having arisen between Mr Delegate Madden and Mr
 19100	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCandidate Lynch regarding the juridical and theological dilemma created
 19101	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the event of one Siamese twin predeceasing the other, the difficulty
 19102	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby mutual consent was referred to Mr Canvasser Bloom for instant
 19103	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsubmittal to Mr Coadjutor Deacon Dedalus. Hitherto silent, whether the
 19104	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbetter to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity of the
 19105	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgarb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice, he
 19106	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdelivered briefly and, as some thought, perfunctorily the ecclesiastical
 19107	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tordinance forbidding man to put asunder what God has joined.
 19108	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 19109	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBut Malachias’ tale began to freeze them with horror. He conjured up the
 19110	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tscene before them. The secret panel beside the chimney slid back and in
 19111	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe recess appeared... Haines! Which of us did not feel his flesh creep!
 19112	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe had a portfolio full of Celtic literature in one hand, in the other
 19113	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta phial marked Poison. Surprise, horror, loathing were depicted on all
 19114	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfaces while he eyed them with a ghostly grin. I anticipated some such
 19115	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\treception, he began with an eldritch laugh, for which, it seems, history
 19116	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tis to blame. Yes, it is true. I am the murderer of Samuel Childs.
 19117	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd how I am punished! The inferno has no terrors for me. This is the
 19118	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tappearance is on me. Tare and ages, what way would I be resting at all,
 19119	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the muttered thickly, and I tramping Dublin this while back with my share
 19120	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof songs and himself after me the like of a soulth or a bullawurrus? My
 19121	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thell, and Ireland’s, is in this life. It is what I tried to obliterate
 19122	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmy crime. Distractions, rookshooting, the Erse language (he recited
 19123	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsome), laudanum (he raised the phial to his lips), camping out. In vain!
 19124	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis spectre stalks me. Dope is my only hope... Ah! Destruction! The
 19125	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblack panther! With a cry he suddenly vanished and the panel slid back.
 19126	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAn instant later his head appeared in the door opposite and said: Meet
 19127	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tme at Westland Row station at ten past eleven. He was gone. Tears
 19128	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgushed from the eyes of the dissipated host. The seer raised his hand
 19129	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto heaven, murmuring: The vendetta of Mananaun! The sage repeated: Lex
 19130	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttalionis. The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring
 19131	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe immense debtorship for a thing done. Malachias, overcome by emotion,
 19132	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tceased. The mystery was unveiled. Haines was the third brother. His
 19133	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\treal name was Childs. The black panther was himself the ghost of his own
 19134	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfather. He drank drugs to obliterate. For this relief much thanks. The
 19135	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlonely house by the graveyard is uninhabited. No soul will live there.
 19136	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe spider pitches her web in the solitude. The nocturnal rat peers from
 19137	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this hole. A curse is on it. It is haunted. Murderer’s ground.
 19138	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 19139	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhat is the age of the soul of man? As she hath the virtue of the
 19140	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchameleon to change her hue at every new approach, to be gay with the
 19141	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmerry and mournful with the downcast, so too is her age changeable as
 19142	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther mood. No longer is Leopold, as he sits there, ruminating, chewing
 19143	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe cud of reminiscence, that staid agent of publicity and holder of a
 19144	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmodest substance in the funds. A score of years are blown away. He is
 19145	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyoung Leopold. There, as in a retrospective arrangement, a mirror within
 19146	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta mirror (hey, presto!), he beholdeth himself. That young figure of then
 19147	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tis seen, precociously manly, walking on a nipping morning from the old
 19148	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thouse in Clanbrassil street to the high school, his booksatchel on
 19149	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim bandolierwise, and in it a goodly hunk of wheaten loaf, a mother’s
 19150	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthought. Or it is the same figure, a year or so gone over, in his first
 19151	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thard hat (ah, that was a day!), already on the road, a fullfledged
 19152	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttraveller for the family firm, equipped with an orderbook, a scented
 19153	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thandkerchief (not for show only), his case of bright trinketware (alas!
 19154	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta thing now of the past!) and a quiverful of compliant smiles for this
 19155	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tor that halfwon housewife reckoning it out upon her fingertips or for
 19156	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta budding virgin, shyly acknowledging (but the heart? tell me!) his
 19157	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstudied baisemoins. The scent, the smile, but, more than these, the dark
 19158	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\teyes and oleaginous address, brought home at duskfall many a commission
 19159	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto the head of the firm, seated with Jacob’s pipe after like labours in
 19160	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe paternal ingle (a meal of noodles, you may be sure, is aheating),
 19161	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\treading through round horned spectacles some paper from the Europe of a
 19162	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmonth before. But hey, presto, the mirror is breathed on and the young
 19163	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknighterrant recedes, shrivels, dwindles to a tiny speck within the
 19164	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmist. Now he is himself paternal and these about him might be his
 19165	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsons. Who can say? The wise father knows his own child. He thinks of a
 19166	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdrizzling night in Hatch street, hard by the bonded stores there, the
 19167	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfirst. Together (she is a poor waif, a child of shame, yours and mine
 19168	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand of all for a bare shilling and her luckpenny), together they hear
 19169	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe heavy tread of the watch as two raincaped shadows pass the new royal
 19170	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tuniversity. Bridie! Bridie Kelly! He will never forget the name, ever
 19171	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tremember the night: first night, the bridenight. They are entwined
 19172	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin nethermost darkness, the willer with the willed, and in an instant
 19173	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t(fiat!) light shall flood the world. Did heart leap to heart? Nay, fair
 19174	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\treader. In a breath ‘twas done but—hold! Back! It must not be! In terror
 19175	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe poor girl flees away through the murk. She is the bride of darkness,
 19176	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta daughter of night. She dare not bear the sunnygolden babe of day. No,
 19177	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLeopold. Name and memory solace thee not. That youthful illusion of
 19178	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthy strength was taken from thee—and in vain. No son of thy loins is by
 19179	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthee. There is none now to be for Leopold, what Leopold was for Rudolph.
 19180	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 19181	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe voices blend and fuse in clouded silence: silence that is the
 19182	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinfinite of space: and swiftly, silently the soul is wafted over regions
 19183	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof cycles of generations that have lived. A region where grey twilight
 19184	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tever descends, never falls on wide sagegreen pasturefields, shedding her
 19185	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdusk, scattering a perennial dew of stars. She follows her mother with
 19186	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tungainly steps, a mare leading her fillyfoal. Twilight phantoms
 19187	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tare they, yet moulded in prophetic grace of structure, slim shapely
 19188	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thaunches, a supple tendonous neck, the meek apprehensive skull. They
 19189	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfade, sad phantoms: all is gone. Agendath is a waste land, a home of
 19190	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tscreechowls and the sandblind upupa. Netaim, the golden, is no more. And
 19191	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton the highway of the clouds they come, muttering thunder of rebellion,
 19192	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe ghosts of beasts. Huuh! Hark! Huuh! Parallax stalks behind and goads
 19193	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem, the lancinating lightnings of whose brow are scorpions. Elk and
 19194	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyak, the bulls of Bashan and of Babylon, mammoth and mastodon, they come
 19195	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttrooping to the sunken sea, Lacus Mortis. Ominous revengeful zodiacal
 19196	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thost! They moan, passing upon the clouds, horned and capricorned, the
 19197	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttrumpeted with the tusked, the lionmaned, the giantantlered, snouter
 19198	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand crawler, rodent, ruminant and pachyderm, all their moving moaning
 19199	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmultitude, murderers of the sun.
 19200	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 19201	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOnward to the dead sea they tramp to drink, unslaked and with horrible
 19202	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgulpings, the salt somnolent inexhaustible flood. And the equine portent
 19203	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgrows again, magnified in the deserted heavens, nay to heaven’s own
 19204	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmagnitude, till it looms, vast, over the house of Virgo. And lo, wonder
 19205	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof metempsychosis, it is she, the everlasting bride, harbinger of the
 19206	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdaystar, the bride, ever virgin. It is she, Martha, thou lost one,
 19207	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMillicent, the young, the dear, the radiant. How serene does she now
 19208	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tarise, a queen among the Pleiades, in the penultimate antelucan hour,
 19209	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshod in sandals of bright gold, coifed with a veil of what do you call
 19210	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit gossamer. It floats, it flows about her starborn flesh and loose it
 19211	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstreams, emerald, sapphire, mauve and heliotrope, sustained on currents
 19212	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the cold interstellar wind, winding, coiling, simply swirling,
 19213	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twrithing in the skies a mysterious writing till, after a myriad
 19214	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmetamorphoses of symbol, it blazes, Alpha, a ruby and triangled sign
 19215	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tupon the forehead of Taurus.
 19216	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 19217	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFrancis was reminding Stephen of years before when they had been at
 19218	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tschool together in Conmee’s time. He asked about Glaucon, Alcibiades,
 19219	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPisistratus. Where were they now? Neither knew. You have spoken of the
 19220	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpast and its phantoms, Stephen said. Why think of them? If I call them
 19221	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinto life across the waters of Lethe will not the poor ghosts troop to
 19222	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmy call? Who supposes it? I, Bous Stephanoumenos, bullockbefriending
 19223	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbard, am lord and giver of their life. He encircled his gadding hair
 19224	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith a coronal of vineleaves, smiling at Vincent. That answer and those
 19225	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tleaves, Vincent said to him, will adorn you more fitly when something
 19226	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmore, and greatly more, than a capful of light odes can call your genius
 19227	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfather. All who wish you well hope this for you. All desire to see
 19228	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou bring forth the work you meditate, to acclaim you Stephaneforos. I
 19229	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\theartily wish you may not fail them. O no, Vincent Lenehan said, laying
 19230	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta hand on the shoulder near him. Have no fear. He could not leave his
 19231	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmother an orphan. The young man’s face grew dark. All could see how hard
 19232	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit was for him to be reminded of his promise and of his recent loss. He
 19233	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould have withdrawn from the feast had not the noise of voices allayed
 19234	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe smart. Madden had lost five drachmas on Sceptre for a whim of the
 19235	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trider’s name: Lenehan as much more. He told them of the race. The flag
 19236	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfell and, huuh! off, scamper, the mare ran out freshly with O. Madden
 19237	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tup. She was leading the field. All hearts were beating. Even Phyllis
 19238	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcould not contain herself. She waved her scarf and cried: Huzzah!
 19239	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSceptre wins! But in the straight on the run home when all were in close
 19240	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\torder the dark horse Throwaway drew level, reached, outstripped her. All
 19241	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas lost now. Phyllis was silent: her eyes were sad anemones. Juno, she
 19242	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcried, I am undone. But her lover consoled her and brought her a bright
 19243	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcasket of gold in which lay some oval sugarplums which she partook. A
 19244	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttear fell: one only. A whacking fine whip, said Lenehan, is W. Lane.
 19245	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFour winners yesterday and three today. What rider is like him? Mount
 19246	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim on the camel or the boisterous buffalo the victory in a hack canter
 19247	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tis still his. But let us bear it as was the ancient wont. Mercy on the
 19248	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tluckless! Poor Sceptre! he said with a light sigh. She is not the filly
 19249	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat she was. Never, by this hand, shall we behold such another. By gad,
 19250	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsir, a queen of them. Do you remember her, Vincent? I wish you could
 19251	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thave seen my queen today, Vincent said. How young she was and radiant
 19252	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t(Lalage were scarce fair beside her) in her yellow shoes and frock of
 19253	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmuslin, I do not know the right name of it. The chestnuts that shaded
 19254	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tus were in bloom: the air drooped with their persuasive odour and with
 19255	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpollen floating by us. In the sunny patches one might easily have
 19256	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcooked on a stone a batch of those buns with Corinth fruit in them that
 19257	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPeriplipomenes sells in his booth near the bridge. But she had nought
 19258	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor her teeth but the arm with which I held her and in that she nibbled
 19259	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmischievously when I pressed too close. A week ago she lay ill, four
 19260	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdays on the couch, but today she was free, blithe, mocked at peril.
 19261	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe is more taking then. Her posies too! Mad romp that she is, she had
 19262	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpulled her fill as we reclined together. And in your ear, my friend, you
 19263	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twill not think who met us as we left the field. Conmee himself! He was
 19264	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twalking by the hedge, reading, I think a brevier book with, I doubt not,
 19265	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta witty letter in it from Glycera or Chloe to keep the page. The sweet
 19266	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcreature turned all colours in her confusion, feigning to reprove a
 19267	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tslight disorder in her dress: a slip of underwood clung there for the
 19268	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvery trees adore her. When Conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely
 19269	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\techo in that little mirror she carries. But he had been kind. In going
 19270	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby he had blessed us. The gods too are ever kind, Lenehan said. If I had
 19271	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpoor luck with Bass’s mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more
 19272	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpropensely. He was laying his hand upon a winejar: Malachi saw it and
 19273	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twithheld his act, pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label.
 19274	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWarily, Malachi whispered, preserve a druid silence. His soul is far
 19275	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\taway. It is as painful perhaps to be awakened from a vision as to be
 19276	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tborn. Any object, intensely regarded, may be a gate of access to the
 19277	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tincorruptible eon of the gods. Do you not think it, Stephen? Theosophos
 19278	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttold me so, Stephen answered, whom in a previous existence Egyptian
 19279	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpriests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law. The lords of the
 19280	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmoon, Theosophos told me, an orangefiery shipload from planet Alpha
 19281	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these
 19282	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second
 19283	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconstellation.
 19284	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 19285	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHowever, as a matter of fact though, the preposterous surmise about him
 19286	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeing in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which was
 19287	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tentirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character, was not
 19288	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe case at all. The individual whose visual organs while the above
 19289	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of
 19290	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanimation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody
 19291	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty
 19292	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspeedily in the wrong shop. During the past four minutes or thereabouts
 19293	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one Bass bottled
 19294	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby Messrs Bass and Co at Burton-on-Trent which happened to be situated
 19295	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tamongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was
 19296	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcertainly calculated to attract anyone’s remark on account of its
 19297	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tscarlet appearance. He was simply and solely, as it subsequently
 19298	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttranspired for reasons best known to himself, which put quite an
 19299	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\taltogether different complexion on the proceedings, after the moment
 19300	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbefore’s observations about boyhood days and the turf, recollecting two
 19301	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tor three private transactions of his own which the other two were as
 19302	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmutually innocent of as the babe unborn. Eventually, however, both
 19303	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other was
 19304	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tendeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily determined
 19305	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the
 19306	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid sought after and
 19307	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmade a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with, also at the
 19308	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsame time, however, a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not
 19309	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto upset any of the beer that was in it about the place.
 19310	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 19311	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the
 19312	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcourse of life. Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity. The
 19313	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdebaters were the keenest in the land, the theme they were engaged on
 19314	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe loftiest and most vital. The high hall of Horne’s house had never
 19315	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the
 19316	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\told rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so
 19317	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tencyclopaedic. A gallant scene in truth it made. Crotthers was there at
 19318	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe foot of the table in his striking Highland garb, his face glowing
 19319	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom the briny airs of the Mull of Galloway. There too, opposite to him,
 19320	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas Lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early depravity
 19321	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand premature wisdom. Next the Scotchman was the place assigned to
 19322	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCostello, the eccentric, while at his side was seated in stolid repose
 19323	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe squat form of Madden. The chair of the resident indeed stood vacant
 19324	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbefore the hearth but on either flank of it the figure of Bannon in
 19325	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\texplorer’s kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues contrasted
 19326	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsharply with the primrose elegance and townbred manners of Malachi
 19327	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRoland St John Mulligan. Lastly at the head of the board was the young
 19328	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpoet who found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical
 19329	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinquisition in the convivial atmosphere of Socratic discussion, while

 19331	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfresh from the hippodrome, and that vigilant wanderer, soiled by the
 19332	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible
 19333	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdishonour, but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril

 19337	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 19338	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIt had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted
 19339	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttranscendentalism to which Mr S. Dedalus’ (Div. Scep.) contentions
 19340	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould appear to prove him pretty badly addicted runs directly counter to
 19341	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\taccepted scientific methods. Science, it cannot be too often repeated,
 19342	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdeals with tangible phenomena. The man of science like the man in the
 19343	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstreet has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain
 19344	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem as best he can. There may be, it is true, some questions which
 19345	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tscience cannot answer—at present—such as the first problem submitted
 19346	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby Mr L. Bloom (Pubb. Canv.) regarding the future determination of sex.
 19347	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMust we accept the view of Empedocles of Trinacria that the right ovary
 19348	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t(the postmenstrual period, assert others) is responsible for the birth
 19349	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the
 19350	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdifferentiating factors or is it, as most embryologists incline to
 19351	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\topine, such as Culpepper, Spallanzani, Blumenbach, Lusk, Hertwig,
 19352	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLeopold and Valenti, a mixture of both? This would be tantamount to
 19353	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta cooperation (one of nature’s favourite devices) between the nisus
 19354	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tformativus of the nemasperm on the one hand and on the other a happily
 19355	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchosen position, succubitus felix, of the passive element. The other
 19356	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tproblem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital: infant
 19357	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmortality. It is interesting because, as he pertinently remarks, we
 19358	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tare all born in the same way but we all die in different ways. Mr M.
 19359	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMulligan (Hyg. et Eug. Doc.) blames the sanitary conditions in which
 19360	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tour greylunged citizens contract adenoids, pulmonary complaints etc. by
 19361	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinhaling the bacteria which lurk in dust. These factors, he alleged,
 19362	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand the revolting spectacles offered by our streets, hideous publicity
 19363	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tposters, religious ministers of all denominations, mutilated soldiers
 19364	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand sailors, exposed scorbutic cardrivers, the suspended carcases of
 19365	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdead animals, paranoic bachelors and unfructified duennas—these, he
 19366	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaid, were accountable for any and every fallingoff in the calibre of
 19367	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe race. Kalipedia, he prophesied, would soon be generally adopted
 19368	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand all the graces of life, genuinely good music, agreeable literature,
 19369	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlight philosophy, instructive pictures, plastercast reproductions of
 19370	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe classical statues such as Venus and Apollo, artistic coloured
 19371	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tphotographs of prize babies, all these little attentions would enable
 19372	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tladies who were in a particular condition to pass the intervening months
 19373	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin a most enjoyable manner. Mr J. Crotthers (Disc. Bacc.) attributes
 19374	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsome of these demises to abdominal trauma in the case of women workers
 19375	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsubjected to heavy labours in the workshop and to marital discipline in
 19376	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe home but by far the vast majority to neglect, private or official,
 19377	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tculminating in the exposure of newborn infants, the practice of criminal
 19378	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabortion or in the atrocious crime of infanticide. Although the former
 19379	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t(we are thinking of neglect) is undoubtedly only too true the case he
 19380	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcites of nurses forgetting to count the sponges in the peritoneal cavity
 19381	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tis too rare to be normative. In fact when one comes to look into it the
 19382	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twonder is that so many pregnancies and deliveries go off so well as they
 19383	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdo, all things considered and in spite of our human shortcomings which
 19384	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\toften baulk nature in her intentions. An ingenious suggestion is
 19385	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat thrown out by Mr V. Lynch (Bacc. Arith.) that both natality and
 19386	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmortality, as well as all other phenomena of evolution, tidal movements,
 19387	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlunar phases, blood temperatures, diseases in general, everything, in
 19388	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfine, in nature’s vast workshop from the extinction of some remote sun
 19389	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto the blossoming of one of the countless flowers which beautify our
 19390	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpublic parks is subject to a law of numeration as yet unascertained.
 19391	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStill the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy
 19392	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tparents and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after succumbs
 19393	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunaccountably in early childhood (though other children of the same
 19394	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmarriage do not) must certainly, in the poet’s words, give us pause.
 19395	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNature, we may rest assured, has her own good and cogent reasons for
 19396	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law
 19397	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof anticipation by which organisms in which morbous germs have taken
 19398	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tup their residence (modern science has conclusively shown that only the
 19399	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplasmic substance can be said to be immortal) tend to disappear at an
 19400	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tincreasingly earlier stage of development, an arrangement which, though
 19401	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tproductive of pain to some of our feelings (notably the maternal), is
 19402	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnevertheless, some of us think, in the long run beneficial to the
 19403	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trace in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest. Mr S.
 19404	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDedalus’ (Div. Scep.) remark (or should it be called an interruption?)
 19405	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat an omnivorous being which can masticate, deglute, digest and
 19406	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tapparently pass through the ordinary channel with pluterperfect

 19418	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly dropped from its mother. In
 19419	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta recent public controversy with Mr L. Bloom (Pubb. Canv.) which took
 19420	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplace in the commons’ hall of the National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30
 19421	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand 31 Holles street, of which, as is well known, Dr A. Horne (Lic. in
 19422	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMidw., F. K. Q. C. P. I.) is the able and popular master, he is reported
 19423	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby eyewitnesses as having stated that once a woman has let the cat
 19424	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinto the bag (an esthete’s allusion, presumably, to one of the most
 19425	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcomplicated and marvellous of all nature’s processes—the act of sexual
 19426	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcongress) she must let it out again or give it life, as he phrased it,
 19427	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto save her own. At the risk of her own, was the telling rejoinder of
 19428	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this interlocutor, none the less effective for the moderate and measured
 19429	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttone in which it was delivered.
 19430	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 19431	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMeanwhile the skill and patience of the physician had brought about a
 19432	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thappy accouchement. It had been a weary weary while both for patient and
 19433	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdoctor. All that surgical skill could do was done and the brave woman
 19434	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad manfully helped. She had. She had fought the good fight and now she
 19435	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas very very happy. Those who have passed on, who have gone before,

 19439	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto see), in the first bloom of her new motherhood, breathing a silent
 19440	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprayer of thanksgiving to One above, the Universal Husband. And as her

 19445	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the whirligig of years a grave dignity has come to the conscientious

 19482	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttrick, upon words so embittered as to accuse in their speaker an
 19483	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunhealthiness, a flair, for the cruder things of life. A scene
 19484	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdisengages itself in the observer’s memory, evoked, it would seem, by
 19485	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta word of so natural a homeliness as if those days were really present

 25169	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25170	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPreparatory to anything else Mr Bloom brushed off the greater bulk of
 25171	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe shavings and handed Stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up
 25172	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgenerally in orthodox Samaritan fashion which he very badly needed. His
 25173	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t(Stephen’s) mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit
 25174	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink Mr
 25175	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of Vartry water
 25176	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tavailable for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit upon an
 25177	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\texpedient by suggesting, off the reel, the propriety of the cabman’s
 25178	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshelter, as it was called, hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt bridge
 25179	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhere they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and
 25180	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsoda or a mineral. But how to get there was the rub. For the nonce he
 25181	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him
 25182	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means
 25183	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tduring which Stephen repeatedly yawned. So far as he could see he was
 25184	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly advisable
 25185	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto get a conveyance of some description which would answer in their
 25186	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthen condition, both of them being e.d.ed, particularly Stephen, always
 25187	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tassuming that there was such a thing to be found. Accordingly after a
 25188	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfew such preliminaries as brushing, in spite of his having forgotten
 25189	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman
 25190	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tservice in the shaving line, they both walked together along Beaver
 25191	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstreet or, more properly, lane as far as the farrier’s and the
 25192	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdistinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of
 25193	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMontgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence
 25194	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdebouching into Amiens street round by the corner of Dan Bergin’s. But
 25195	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for
 25196	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler, probably engaged by some
 25197	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfellows inside on the spree, outside the North Star hotel and there was
 25198	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tno symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom, who was
 25199	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanything but a professional whistler, endeavoured to hail it by emitting
 25200	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta kind of a whistle, holding his arms arched over his head, twice.
 25201	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25202	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThis was a quandary but, bringing common sense to bear on it, evidently
 25203	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthere was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it
 25204	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhich they accordingly did. So, bevelling around by Mullett’s and the
 25205	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSignal House which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the
 25206	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdirection of Amiens street railway terminus, Mr Bloom being handicapped
 25207	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had,
 25208	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto vary the timehonoured adage, gone the way of all buttons though,
 25209	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tentering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made
 25210	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlight of the mischance. So as neither of them were particularly pressed
 25211	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor time, as it happened, and the temperature refreshing since it
 25212	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcleared up after the recent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius, they dandered
 25213	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\talong past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a
 25214	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjarvey. As it so happened a Dublin United Tramways Company’s sandstrewer
 25215	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thappened to be returning and the elder man recounted to his companion
 25216	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tà propos of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little
 25217	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhile back. They passed the main entrance of the Great Northern railway
 25218	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstation, the starting point for Belfast, where of course all traffic was
 25219	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuspended at that late hour and passing the backdoor of the morgue
 25220	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t(a not very enticing locality, not to say gruesome to a degree, more
 25221	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tespecially at night) ultimately gained the Dock Tavern and in due course
 25222	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tturned into Store street, famous for its C division police station.
 25223	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBetween this point and the high at present unlit warehouses of Beresford
 25224	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplace Stephen thought to think of Ibsen, associated with Baird’s the
 25225	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstonecutter’s in his mind somehow in Talbot place, first turning on the
 25226	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tright, while the other who was acting as his fidus Achates inhaled with
 25227	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinternal satisfaction the smell of James Rourke’s city bakery, situated
 25228	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tquite close to where they were, the very palatable odour indeed of
 25229	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tour daily bread, of all commodities of the public the primary and most
 25230	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tindispensable. Bread, the staff of life, earn your bread, O tell me
 25231	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhere is fancy bread, at Rourke’s the baker’s it is said.
 25232	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25233	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEn route to his taciturn and, not to put too fine a point on it, not
 25234	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyet perfectly sober companion Mr Bloom who at all events was in complete
 25235	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpossession of his faculties, never more so, in fact disgustingly sober,
 25236	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspoke a word of caution re the dangers of nighttown, women of ill fame
 25237	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand swell mobsmen, which, barely permissible once in a while though not
 25238	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas a habitual practice, was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for
 25239	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyoung fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking
 25240	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thabits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu
 25241	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could
 25242	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tadminister a nasty kick if you didn’t look out. Highly providential
 25243	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas the appearance on the scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen was
 25244	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblissfully unconscious but for that man in the gap turning up at the
 25245	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\televenth hour the finis might have been that he might have been a
 25246	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcandidate for the accident ward or, failing that, the bridewell and
 25247	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tan appearance in the court next day before Mr Tobias or, he being the
 25248	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsolicitor rather, old Wall, he meant to say, or Mahony which simply
 25249	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about. The reason he mentioned
 25250	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe fact was that a lot of those policemen, whom he cordially disliked,
 25251	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the Crown and, as Mr
 25252	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBloom put it, recalling a case or two in the A division in Clanbrassil
 25253	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstreet, prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot. Never on
 25254	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the city, Pembroke road for
 25255	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\texample, the guardians of the law were well in evidence, the obvious
 25256	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\treason being they were paid to protect the upper classes. Another thing
 25257	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the commented on was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of
 25258	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tany description liable to go off at any time which was tantamount to
 25259	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinciting them against civilians should by any chance they fall out over
 25260	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanything. You frittered away your time, he very sensibly maintained, and
 25261	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thealth and also character besides which, the squandermania of the thing,
 25262	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfast women of the demimonde ran away with a lot of £. s. d. into the
 25263	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbargain and the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with
 25264	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthough, touching the much vexed question of stimulants, he relished a
 25265	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking
 25266	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand possessing aperient virtues (notably a good burgundy which he was
 25267	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta staunch believer in) still never beyond a certain point where he
 25268	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinvariably drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say
 25269	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnothing of your being at the tender mercy of others practically. Most
 25270	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof all he commented adversely on the desertion of Stephen by all his
 25271	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpubhunting confrères but one, a most glaring piece of ratting on the
 25272	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpart of his brother medicos under all the circs.
 25273	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25274	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And that one was Judas, Stephen said, who up to then had said nothing
 25275	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhatsoever of any kind.
 25276	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25277	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDiscussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back
 25278	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge where a brazier
 25279	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one attracted
 25280	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir rather lagging footsteps. Stephen of his own accord stopped for
 25281	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tno special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by
 25282	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker
 25283	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfigure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox. He
 25284	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbegan to remember that this had happened or had been mentioned as having
 25285	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thappened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered
 25286	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat he recognised in the sentry a quondam friend of his father’s,
 25287	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGumley. To avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway
 25288	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbridge.
 25289	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25290	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said.
 25291	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25292	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches
 25293	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaluted again, calling:
 25294	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25295	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Night!
 25296	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25297	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the
 25298	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcompliment. Mr Bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch
 25299	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas he always believed in minding his own business moved off but
 25300	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnevertheless remained on the qui vive with just a shade of anxiety
 25301	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthough not funkyish in the least. Though unusual in the Dublin area he
 25302	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next
 25303	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising
 25304	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpeaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some
 25305	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsecluded spot outside the city proper, famished loiterers of the
 25306	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThames embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply

 25308	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tswoop at a moment’s notice, your money or your life, leaving you there
 25309	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto point a moral, gagged and garrotted.
 25310	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25311	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters,
 25312	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthough he was not in an over sober state himself recognised Corley’s
 25313	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbreath redolent of rotten cornjuice. Lord John Corley some called him
 25314	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand his genealogy came about in this wise. He was the eldest son of
 25315	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinspector Corley of the G division, lately deceased, who had married
 25316	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta certain Katherine Brophy, the daughter of a Louth farmer. His
 25317	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgrandfather Patrick Michael Corley of New Ross had married the widow
 25318	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof a publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine (also) Talbot.
 25319	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRumour had it (though not proved) that she descended from the house of
 25320	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe lords Talbot de Malahide in whose mansion, really an unquestionably
 25321	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfine residence of its kind and well worth seeing, her mother or aunt or
 25322	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsome relative, a woman, as the tale went, of extreme beauty, had enjoyed
 25323	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe distinction of being in service in the washkitchen. This therefore
 25324	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute
 25325	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tman who now addressed Stephen was spoken of by some with facetious
 25326	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tproclivities as Lord John Corley.
 25327	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25328	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTaking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell.
 25329	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNot as much as a farthing to purchase a night’s lodgings. His friends
 25330	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad all deserted him. Furthermore he had a row with Lenehan and called
 25331	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim to Stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of other
 25332	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tuncalledfor expressions. He was out of a job and implored of Stephen to
 25333	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttell him where on God’s earth he could get something, anything at all,
 25334	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto do. No, it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that
 25335	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas fostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected
 25336	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthrough the mother in some way, both occurrences happening at the same
 25337	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttime if the whole thing wasn’t a complete fabrication from start to
 25338	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfinish. Anyhow he was all in.
 25339	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25340	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I wouldn’t ask you only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and God knows
 25341	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI’m on the rocks.
 25342	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25343	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—There’ll be a job tomorrow or next day, Stephen told him, in a boys’
 25344	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tschool at Dalkey for a gentleman usher. Mr Garrett Deasy. Try it. You
 25345	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmay mention my name.
 25346	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25347	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ah, God, Corley replied, sure I couldn’t teach in a school, man. I was
 25348	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnever one of your bright ones, he added with a half laugh. I got stuck
 25349	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttwice in the junior at the christian brothers.
 25350	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25351	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him.
 25352	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25353	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCorley at the first go-off was inclined to suspect it was something to
 25354	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdo with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody
 25355	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttart off the street. There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street, Mrs
 25356	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMaloney’s, but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but
 25357	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tM’Conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over
 25358	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin Winetavern street (which was distantly suggestive to the person
 25359	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\taddressed of friar Bacon) for a bob. He was starving too though he
 25360	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thadn’t said a word about it.
 25361	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25362	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThough this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it
 25363	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstill Stephen’s feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew
 25364	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat Corley’s brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was hardly
 25365	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdeserving of much credence. However haud ignarus malorum miseris
 25366	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuccurrere disco etcetera as the Latin poet remarks especially as luck
 25367	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on
 25368	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though
 25369	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta good bit of the wherewithal was demolished. But the cream of the joke
 25370	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas nothing would get it out of Corley’s head that he was living in
 25371	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\taffluence and hadn’t a thing to do but hand out the needful. Whereas.
 25372	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea of finding any food
 25373	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthere but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu
 25374	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tso that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat but
 25375	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe result was in the negative for, to his chagrin, he found his cash
 25376	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmissing. A few broken biscuits were all the result of his investigation.
 25377	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe tried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost
 25378	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas well he might have or left because in that contingency it was not a
 25379	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpleasant lookout, very much the reverse in fact. He was altogether too
 25380	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfagged out to institute a thorough search though he tried to recollect.
 25381	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAbout biscuits he dimly remembered. Who now exactly gave them he
 25382	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twondered or where was or did he buy. However in another pocket he came
 25383	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tacross what he surmised in the dark were pennies, erroneously however,
 25384	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas it turned out.
 25385	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25386	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Those are halfcrowns, man, Corley corrected him.
 25387	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25388	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd so in point of fact they turned out to be. Stephen anyhow lent him
 25389	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tone of them.
 25390	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25391	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Thanks, Corley answered, you’re a gentleman. I’ll pay you back one
 25392	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttime. Who’s that with you? I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse
 25393	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin Camden street with Boylan, the billsticker. You might put in a good
 25394	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tword for us to get me taken on there. I’d carry a sandwichboard only
 25395	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe girl in the office told me they’re full up for the next three weeks,
 25396	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tman. God, you’ve to book ahead, man, you’d think it was for the Carl
 25397	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRosa. I don’t give a shite anyway so long as I get a job, even as a
 25398	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcrossing sweeper.
 25399	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25400	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSubsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two and six
 25401	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the got he informed Stephen about a fellow by the name of Bags Comisky
 25402	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat he said Stephen knew well out of Fullam’s, the shipchandler’s,
 25403	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbookkeeper there that used to be often round in Nagle’s back with O’Mara
 25404	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand a little chap with a stutter the name of Tighe. Anyhow he was lagged
 25405	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and
 25406	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trefusing to go with the constable.
 25407	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25408	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the
 25409	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation
 25410	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twatchman’s sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work, it struck him,
 25411	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own
 25412	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprivate account while Dublin slept. He threw an odd eye at the same time
 25413	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnow and then at Stephen’s anything but immaculately attired interlocutor
 25414	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was
 25415	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnot in a position to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when.
 25416	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBeing a levelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in
 25417	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpoint of shrewd observation he also remarked on his very dilapidated
 25418	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\that and slouchy wearing apparel generally testifying to a chronic
 25419	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\timpecuniosity. Palpably he was one of his hangerson but for the
 25420	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmatter of that it was merely a question of one preying on his nextdoor
 25421	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tneighbour all round, in every deep, so to put it, a deeper depth and for
 25422	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock
 25423	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thimself penal servitude with or without the option of a fine would be
 25424	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta very rara avis altogether. In any case he had a consummate amount of
 25425	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning.
 25426	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPretty thick that was certainly.
 25427	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25428	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom who, with his
 25429	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpractised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the
 25430	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblandiloquence of the other parasite. Alluding to the encounter he said,
 25431	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlaughingly, Stephen, that is:
 25432	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25433	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—He is down on his luck. He asked me to ask you to ask somebody named
 25434	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBoylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman.
 25435	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25436	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAt this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest, Mr
 25437	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the
 25438	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdirection of a bucketdredger, rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblana,
 25439	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmoored alongside Customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair,
 25440	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhereupon he observed evasively:
 25441	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25442	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Everybody gets their own ration of luck, they say. Now you mention it
 25443	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this face was familiar to me. But, leaving that for the moment, how much
 25444	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdid you part with, he queried, if I am not too inquisitive?
 25445	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25446	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Half a crown, Stephen responded. I daresay he needs it to sleep
 25447	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsomewhere.
 25448	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25449	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Needs! Mr Bloom ejaculated, professing not the least surprise at
 25450	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe intelligence, I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he
 25451	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinvariably does. Everyone according to his needs or everyone according
 25452	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto his deeds. But, talking about things in general, where, added he with
 25453	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta smile, will you sleep yourself? Walking to Sandycove is out of
 25454	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe question. And even supposing you did you won’t get in after what
 25455	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\toccurred at Westland Row station. Simply fag out there for nothing. I
 25456	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdon’t mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why
 25457	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdid you leave your father’s house?
 25458	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25459	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—To seek misfortune, was Stephen’s answer.
 25460	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25461	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I met your respected father on a recent occasion, Mr Bloom
 25462	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdiplomatically returned, today in fact, or to be strictly accurate, on
 25463	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyesterday. Where does he live at present? I gathered in the course of
 25464	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconversation that he had moved.
 25465	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25466	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I believe he is in Dublin somewhere, Stephen answered unconcernedly.
 25467	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhy?
 25468	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25469	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—A gifted man, Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior, in more respects than
 25470	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tone and a born raconteur if ever there was one. He takes great pride,
 25471	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tquite legitimate, out of you. You could go back perhaps, he hasarded,
 25472	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstill thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row terminus
 25473	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhen it was perfectly evident that the other two, Mulligan, that is, and
 25474	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat English tourist friend of his, who eventually euchred their third
 25475	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcompanion, were patently trying as if the whole bally station belonged
 25476	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto them to give Stephen the slip in the confusion, which they did.
 25477	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25478	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThere was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however, such as it
 25479	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas, Stephen’s mind’s eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his
 25480	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfamily hearth the last time he saw it with his sister Dilly sitting by
 25481	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak Trinidad shell
 25482	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he
 25483	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcould drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the Friday herrings
 25484	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for Maggy, Boody and
 25485	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKatey, the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells
 25486	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper, in
 25487	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\taccordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain
 25488	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton the days commanded, it being quarter tense or if not, ember days or
 25489	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsomething like that.
 25490	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25491	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—No, Mr Bloom repeated again, I wouldn’t personally repose much trust
 25492	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element, Dr
 25493	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMulligan, as a guide, philosopher and friend if I were in your shoes. He
 25494	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he
 25495	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnever realised what it is to be without regular meals. Of course you
 25496	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdidn’t notice as much as I did. But it wouldn’t occasion me the least
 25497	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsurprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in
 25498	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyour drink for some ulterior object.
 25499	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25500	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe understood however from all he heard that Dr Mulligan was a versatile
 25501	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tallround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who was rapidly
 25502	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcoming to the fore in his line and, if the report was verified, bade
 25503	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as
 25504	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services
 25505	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from
 25506	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcertain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first
 25507	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\taid at Skerries, or Malahide was it?, was, he was bound to admit, an
 25508	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\texceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise, so that
 25509	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be
 25510	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy,
 25511	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpure and simple.
 25512	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25513	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking
 25514	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyour brains, he ventured to throw out.
 25515	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25516	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by
 25517	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfriendliness which he gave at Stephen’s at present morose expression
 25518	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof features did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact on the
 25519	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tproblem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge by
 25520	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttwo or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about saw
 25521	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthrough the affair and for some reason or other best known to himself
 25522	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tallowed matters to more or less. Grinding poverty did have that effect
 25523	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand he more than conjectured that, high educational abilities though he
 25524	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpossessed, he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet.
 25525	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25526	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAdjacent to the men’s public urinal they perceived an icecream car round
 25527	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhich a group of presumably Italians in heated altercation were getting
 25528	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly
 25529	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanimated way, there being some little differences between the parties.
 25530	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25531	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Puttana madonna, che ci dia i quattrini! Ho ragione? Culo rotto!
 25532	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25533	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Intendiamoci. Mezzo sovrano più...
 25534	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25535	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Dice lui, però!
 25536	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25537	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Mezzo.
 25538	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25539	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Farabutto! Mortacci sui!
 25540	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25541	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ma ascolta! Cinque la testa più...
 25542	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25543	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman’s shelter, an unpretentious
 25544	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twooden structure, where, prior to then, he had rarely if ever been
 25545	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbefore, the former having previously whispered to the latter a few
 25546	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous Skin-the-Goat
 25547	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFitzharris, the invincible, though he could not vouch for the actual
 25548	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfacts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in. A few
 25549	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmoments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner
 25550	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tonly to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection
 25551	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the genus homo
 25552	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\talready there engaged in eating and drinking diversified by conversation
 25553	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity.
 25554	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25555	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Now touching a cup of coffee, Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest
 25556	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto break the ice, it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the
 25557	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshape of solid food, say, a roll of some description.
 25558	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25559	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAccordingly his first act was with characteristic sangfroid to order
 25560	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthese commodities quietly. The hoi polloi of jarvies or stevedores
 25561	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tor whatever they were after a cursory examination turned their eyes
 25562	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tapparently dissatisfied, away though one redbearded bibulous individual,
 25563	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tportion of whose hair was greyish, a sailor probably, still stared for
 25564	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsome appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the
 25565	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfloor. Mr Bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech, he having
 25566	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjust a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute, though, to be
 25567	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsure, rather in a quandary over voglio, remarked to his protégé in an
 25568	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\taudible tone of voice à propos of the battle royal in the street which
 25569	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas still raging fast and furious:
 25570	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25571	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—A beautiful language. I mean for singing purposes. Why do you not write
 25572	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyour poetry in that language? Bella Poetria! It is so melodious and
 25573	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfull. Belladonna. Voglio.
 25574	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25575	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could, suffering
 25576	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom lassitude generally, replied:
 25577	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25578	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—To fill the ear of a cow elephant. They were haggling over money.
 25579	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25580	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Is that so? Mr Bloom asked. Of course, he subjoined pensively, at the
 25581	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were
 25582	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabsolutely necessary, it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds
 25583	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit.
 25584	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25585	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe keeper of the shelter in the middle of this tête-à-tête put a
 25586	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tboiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table
 25587	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun, or so it seemed. After
 25588	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhich he beat a retreat to his counter, Mr Bloom determining to have
 25589	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta good square look at him later on so as not to appear to. For which
 25590	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\treason he encouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did
 25591	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily
 25592	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsupposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him.
 25593	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25594	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Sounds are impostures, Stephen said after a pause of some little time,
 25595	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlike names. Cicero, Podmore, Napoleon, Mr Goodbody. Jesus, Mr Doyle.
 25596	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShakespeares were as common as Murphies. What’s in a name?
 25597	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25598	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, to be sure, Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred. Of course. Our name
 25599	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across.
 25600	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25601	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded
 25602	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen, whom he had singled out for attention in particular, squarely
 25603	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby asking:
 25604	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25605	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And what might your name be?
 25606	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25607	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJust in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion’s boot but
 25608	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen, apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected
 25609	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tquarter, answered:
 25610	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25611	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Dedalus.
 25612	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25613	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes,
 25614	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trather bunged up from excessive use of boose, preferably good old
 25615	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHollands and water.
 25616	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25617	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You know Simon Dedalus? he asked at length.
 25618	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25619	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I’ve heard of him, Stephen said.
 25620	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25621	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently
 25622	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\teavesdropping too.
 25623	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25624	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—He’s Irish, the seaman bold affirmed, staring still in much the same
 25625	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tway and nodding. All Irish.
 25626	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25627	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—All too Irish, Stephen rejoined.
 25628	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25629	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAs for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business
 25630	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor
 25631	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof his own accord turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the
 25632	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tremark:
 25633	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25634	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his
 25635	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshoulder. The lefthand dead shot.
 25636	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25637	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThough he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his
 25638	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain.
 25639	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25640	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Bottles out there, say. Fifty yards measured. Eggs on the bottles.
 25641	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCocks his gun over his shoulder. Aims.
 25642	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25643	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely. Then he
 25644	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tscrewed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the night
 25645	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith an unprepossessing cast of countenance.
 25646	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25647	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Pom! he then shouted once.
 25648	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25649	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation, there
 25650	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeing still a further egg.
 25651	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25652	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Pom! he shouted twice.
 25653	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25654	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEgg two evidently demolished, he nodded and winked, adding
 25655	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbloodthirstily:
 25656	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25657	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t      —Buffalo Bill shoots to kill,
 25658	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t      Never missed nor he never will.
 25659	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25660	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness’ sake just felt like
 25661	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tasking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the
 25662	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBisley.
 25663	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25664	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Beg pardon, the sailor said.
 25665	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25666	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Long ago? Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth.
 25667	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25668	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent under the magic
 25669	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinfluence of diamond cut diamond, it might be a matter of ten years. He
 25670	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttoured the wide world with Hengler’s Royal Circus. I seen him do that in
 25671	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStockholm.
 25672	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25673	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Curious coincidence, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively.
 25674	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25675	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Murphy’s my name, the sailor continued. D. B. Murphy of Carrigaloe.
 25676	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tKnow where that is?
 25677	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25678	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Queenstown harbour, Stephen replied.
 25679	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25680	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That’s right, the sailor said. Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle. That’s
 25681	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhere I hails from. I belongs there. That’s where I hails from. My
 25682	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlittle woman’s down there. She’s waiting for me, I know. For England,
 25683	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thome and beauty. She’s my own true wife I haven’t seen for seven years
 25684	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnow, sailing about.
 25685	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25686	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene, the homecoming
 25687	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto the mariner’s roadside shieling after having diddled Davy Jones,
 25688	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta rainy night with a blind moon. Across the world for a wife. Quite a
 25689	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnumber of stories there were on that particular Alice Ben Bolt topic,
 25690	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEnoch Arden and Rip van Winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember Caoc
 25691	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tO’Leary, a favourite and most trying declamation piece by the way of
 25692	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpoor John Casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way.
 25693	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNever about the runaway wife coming back, however much devoted to the
 25694	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabsentee. The face at the window! Judge of his astonishment when he
 25695	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfinally did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent
 25696	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this better half, wrecked in his affections. You little expected me but
 25697	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI’ve come to stay and make a fresh start. There she sits, a grasswidow,
 25698	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat the selfsame fireside. Believes me dead, rocked in the cradle of the
 25699	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdeep. And there sits uncle Chubb or Tomkin, as the case might be, the
 25700	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpublican of the Crown and Anchor, in shirtsleeves, eating rumpsteak and
 25701	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tonions. No chair for father. Broo! The wind! Her brandnew arrival is
 25702	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton her knee, post mortem child. With a high ro! and a randy ro! and my
 25703	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgalloping tearing tandy, O! Bow to the inevitable. Grin and bear it. I
 25704	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tremain with much love your brokenhearted husband D B Murphy.
 25705	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25706	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident, turned to one
 25707	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the jarvies with the request:
 25708	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25709	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You don’t happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you?
 25710	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25711	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die of
 25712	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was
 25713	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpassed from hand to hand.
 25714	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25715	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Thank you, the sailor said.
 25716	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25717	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing and with some slow
 25718	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstammers, proceeded:
 25719	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25720	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—We come up this morning eleven o’clock. The threemaster Rosevean from
 25721	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBridgwater with bricks. I shipped to get over. Paid off this afternoon.
 25722	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThere’s my discharge. See? D. B. Murphy. A. B. S.
 25723	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25724	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIn confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket
 25725	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand handed to his neighbour a not very cleanlooking folded document.
 25726	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25727	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked,
 25728	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tleaning on the counter.
 25729	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25730	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Why, the sailor answered upon reflection upon it, I’ve circumnavigated
 25731	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta bit since I first joined on. I was in the Red Sea. I was in China and
 25732	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNorth America and South America. We was chased by pirates one voyage.
 25733	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI seen icebergs plenty, growlers. I was in Stockholm and the Black Sea,
 25734	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe Dardanelles under Captain Dalton, the best bloody man that ever
 25735	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tscuttled a ship. I seen Russia. Gospodi pomilyou. That’s how the
 25736	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tRussians prays.
 25737	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25738	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You seen queer sights, don’t be talking, put in a jarvey.
 25739	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25740	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Why, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug. I seen queer
 25741	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthings too, ups and downs. I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an
 25742	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanchor same as I chew that quid.
 25743	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25744	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his
 25745	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tteeth, bit ferociously:
 25746	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25747	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Khaan! Like that. And I seen maneaters in Peru that eats corpses and
 25748	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe livers of horses. Look here. Here they are. A friend of mine sent
 25749	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tme.
 25750	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25751	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed to
 25752	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbe in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table. The
 25753	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprinted matter on it stated: Choza de Indios. Beni, Bolivia.
 25754	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25755	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAll focussed their attention at the scene exhibited, a group of savage
 25756	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twomen in striped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning,
 25757	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsleeping amid a swarm of infants (there must have been quite a score of
 25758	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem) outside some primitive shanties of osier.
 25759	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25760	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Chews coca all day, the communicative tarpaulin added. Stomachs like
 25761	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbreadgraters. Cuts off their diddies when they can’t bear no more
 25762	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchildren.
 25763	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25764	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSee them sitting there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horse’s liver
 25765	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\traw.
 25766	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25767	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis postcard proved a centre of attraction for Messrs the greenhorns for
 25768	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseveral minutes if not more.
 25769	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25770	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Know how to keep them off? he inquired generally.
 25771	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25772	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNobody volunteering a statement he winked, saying:
 25773	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25774	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Glass. That boggles ‘em. Glass.
 25775	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25776	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the
 25777	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcard to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark. It ran
 25778	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas follows: Tarjeta Postal, Señor A Boudin, Galeria Becche, Santiago,
 25779	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tChile. There was no message evidently, as he took particular notice.
 25780	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThough not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated (or the
 25781	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\teggsniping transaction for that matter despite William Tell and the
 25782	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLazarillo-Don Cesar de Bazan incident depicted in Maritana on which
 25783	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\toccasion the former’s ball passed through the latter’s hat) having
 25784	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdetected a discrepancy between his name (assuming he was the person
 25785	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours
 25786	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tafter having boxed the compass on the strict q.t. somewhere) and
 25787	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some
 25788	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuspicions of our friend’s bona fides nevertheless it reminded him in a
 25789	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tway of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some Wednesday
 25790	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tor Saturday of travelling to London via long sea not to say that he had
 25791	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was at heart a
 25792	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tborn adventurer though by a trick of fate he had consistently remained
 25793	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta landlubber except you call going to Holyhead which was his longest.
 25794	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMartin Cunningham frequently said he would work a pass through Egan but
 25795	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsome deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up with the net result that
 25796	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe scheme fell through. But even suppose it did come to planking
 25797	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdown the needful and breaking Boyd’s heart it was not so dear, purse
 25798	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpermitting, a few guineas at the outside considering the fare to
 25799	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMullingar where he figured on going was five and six, there and back.
 25800	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone and be in
 25801	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tevery way thoroughly pleasurable, especially for a chap whose liver was
 25802	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout of order, seeing the different places along the route, Plymouth,
 25803	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFalmouth, Southampton and so on culminating in an instructive tour of
 25804	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe sights of the great metropolis, the spectacle of our modern Babylon
 25805	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhere doubtless he would see the greatest improvement, tower, abbey,
 25806	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twealth of Park lane to renew acquaintance with. Another thing just
 25807	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstruck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around
 25808	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a concert
 25809	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure resorts,
 25810	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMargate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas, Eastbourne,
 25811	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tScarborough, Margate and so on, beautiful Bournemouth, the Channel
 25812	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tislands and similar bijou spots, which might prove highly remunerative.
 25813	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNot, of course, with a hole and corner scratch company or local ladies
 25814	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton the job, witness Mrs C P M’Coy type lend me your valise and I’ll post
 25815	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou the ticket. No, something top notch, an all star Irish caste, the
 25816	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTweedy-Flower grand opera company with his own legal consort as leading
 25817	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlady as a sort of counterblast to the Elster Grimes and Moody-Manners,
 25818	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tperfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of success, providing
 25819	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpuffs in the local papers could be managed by some fellow with a bit of
 25820	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbounce who could pull the indispensable wires and thus combine business
 25821	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith pleasure. But who? That was the rub.
 25822	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25823	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAlso, without being actually positive, it struck him a great field was
 25824	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with
 25825	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe times apropos of the Fishguard-Rosslare route which, it was mooted,
 25826	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas once more on the tapis in the circumlocution departments with the
 25827	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tusual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom and
 25828	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdunderheads generally. A great opportunity there certainly was for push
 25829	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand enterprise to meet the travelling needs of the public at large, the
 25830	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\taverage man, i.e. Brown, Robinson and Co.
 25831	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25832	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIt was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no
 25833	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsmall blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street, when the
 25834	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsystem really needed toning up, for the matter of a couple of paltry
 25835	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpounds was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead
 25836	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof being always and ever cooped up since my old stick-in-the-mud took me
 25837	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor a wife. After all, hang it, they had their eleven and more humdrum
 25838	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmonths of it and merited a radical change of venue after the grind

 25843	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around
 25844	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDublin and its picturesque environs even, Poulaphouca to which there was
 25845	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta steamtram, but also farther away from the madding crowd in Wicklow,
 25846	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trightly termed the garden of Ireland, an ideal neighbourhood for elderly
 25847	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twheelmen so long as it didn’t come down, and in the wilds of Donegal
 25848	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhere if report spoke true the coup d’œil was exceedingly grand though
 25849	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that the influx of
 25850	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvisitors was not as yet all that it might be considering the
 25851	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsignal benefits to be derived from it while Howth with its historic
 25852	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tassociations and otherwise, Silken Thomas, Grace O’Malley, George IV,

 25856	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcliffs by design or accidentally, usually, by the way, on their left
 25857	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tleg, it being only about three quarters of an hour’s run from the
 25858	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpillar. Because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely
 25859	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin its infancy, so to speak, and the accommodation left much to be
 25860	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdesired. Interesting to fathom it seemed to him from a motive of
 25861	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcuriosity, pure and simple, was whether it was the traffic that created
 25862	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe route or viceversa or the two sides in fact. He turned back the
 25863	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tother side of the card, picture, and passed it along to Stephen.
 25864	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25865	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I seen a Chinese one time, related the doughty narrator, that had
 25866	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlittle pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened and
 25867	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tevery pill was something different. One was a ship, another was a house,

 25871	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPossibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces the
 25872	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglobetrotter went on, adhering to his adventures.
 25873	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25874	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And I seen a man killed in Trieste by an Italian chap. Knife in his
 25875	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tback. Knife like that.
 25876	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25877	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhilst speaking he produced a dangerouslooking claspknife quite in
 25878	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tkeeping with his character and held it in the striking position.
 25879	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25880	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—In a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers. Fellow
 25881	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thid behind a door, come up behind him. Like that. Prepare to meet your
 25882	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGod, says he. Chuk! It went into his back up to the butt.
 25883	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25884	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis heavy glance drowsily roaming about kind of defied their further
 25885	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tquestions even should they by any chance want to.
 25886	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25887	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That’s a good bit of steel, repeated he, examining his formidable
 25888	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstiletto.
 25889	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25890	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAfter which harrowing dénouement sufficient to appal the stoutest he
 25891	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsnapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before in
 25892	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this chamber of horrors, otherwise pocket.
 25893	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25894	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—They’re great for the cold steel, somebody who was evidently quite in
 25895	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe dark said for the benefit of them all. That was why they thought
 25896	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of
 25897	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem using knives.
 25898	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25899	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAt this remark passed obviously in the spirit of where ignorance
 25900	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tis bliss Mr B. and Stephen, each in his own particular way, both
 25901	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinstinctively exchanged meaning glances, in a religious silence of the
 25902	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstrictly entre nous variety however, towards where Skin-the-Goat, alias
 25903	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe keeper, not turning a hair, was drawing spurts of liquid from his
 25904	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tboiler affair. His inscrutable face which was really a work of art, a
 25905	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tperfect study in itself, beggaring description, conveyed the impression
 25906	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat he didn’t understand one jot of what was going on. Funny, very!
 25907	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25908	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThere ensued a somewhat lengthy pause. One man was reading in fits and
 25909	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstarts a stained by coffee evening journal, another the card with the
 25910	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnatives choza de, another the seaman’s discharge. Mr Bloom, so far as he
 25911	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas personally concerned, was just pondering in pensive mood. He
 25912	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well
 25913	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas yesterday, roughly some score of years previously in the days of the
 25914	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tland troubles, when it took the civilised world by storm, figuratively
 25915	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspeaking, early in the eighties, eightyone to be correct, when he was
 25916	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjust turned fifteen.
 25917	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25918	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ay, boss, the sailor broke in. Give us back them papers.
 25919	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25920	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape.
 25921	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25922	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Have you seen the rock of Gibraltar? Mr Bloom inquired.
 25923	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25924	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ay or
 25925	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tno.
 25926	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25927	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ah, you’ve touched there too, Mr Bloom said, Europa point, thinking he
 25928	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad, in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but
 25929	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the failed to do so, simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the sawdust,
 25930	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn.
 25931	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25932	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What year would that be about? Mr B interrogated. Can you recall the
 25933	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tboats?
 25934	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25935	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOur soi-disant sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before answering:
 25936	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25937	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I’m tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and boats and ships.
 25938	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSalt junk all the time.
 25939	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25940	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTired seemingly, he ceased. His questioner perceiving that he was not
 25941	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlikely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer,
 25942	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the
 25943	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglobe, suffice it to say that, as a casual glance at the map revealed,
 25944	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly
 25945	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhat it meant to rule the waves. On more than one occasion, a dozen
 25946	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat the lowest, near the North Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a
 25947	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuperannuated old salt, evidently derelict, seated habitually near the
 25948	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnot particularly redolent sea on the wall, staring quite obliviously at
 25949	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit and it at him, dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone
 25950	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsomewhere sings. And it left him wondering why. Possibly he had tried to
 25951	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfind out the secret for himself, floundering up and down the antipodes
 25952	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand all that sort of thing and over and under, well, not exactly under,
 25953	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttempting the fates. And the odds were twenty to nil there was really no
 25954	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsecret about it at all. Nevertheless, without going into the minutiae of
 25955	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe business, the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all
 25956	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tits glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had to
 25957	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went to
 25958	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshow how people usually contrived to load that sort of onus on to the
 25959	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tother fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and insurance which were
 25960	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trun on identically the same lines so that for that very reason if no
 25961	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tother lifeboat Sunday was a highly laudable institution to which the
 25962	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpublic at large, no matter where living inland or seaside, as the case
 25963	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmight be, having it brought home to them like that should extend its
 25964	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgratitude also to the harbourmasters and coastguard service who had
 25965	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto man the rigging and push off and out amid the elements whatever the
 25966	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseason when duty called Ireland expects that every man and so on and
 25967	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime not forgetting the
 25968	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIrish lights, Kish and others, liable to capsize at any moment, rounding
 25969	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhich he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkably choppy,
 25970	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnot to say stormy, weather.
 25971	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25972	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—There was a fellow sailed with me in the Rover, the old seadog, himself
 25973	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta rover, proceeded, went ashore and took up a soft job as gentleman’s
 25974	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvalet at six quid a month. Them are his trousers I’ve on me and he gave
 25975	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tme an oilskin and that jackknife. I’m game for that job, shaving and
 25976	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrushup. I hate roaming about. There’s my son now, Danny, run off to
 25977	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsea and his mother got him took in a draper’s in Cork where he could be
 25978	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdrawing easy money.
 25979	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25980	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What age is he? queried one hearer who, by the way, seen from the side,
 25981	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell, the townclerk, away from
 25982	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe carking cares of office, unwashed of course and in a seedy getup and
 25983	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage.
 25984	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25985	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance, my son, Danny?
 25986	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe’d be about eighteen now, way I figure it.
 25987	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25988	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe Skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow
 25989	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to
 25990	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbe seen an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink intended to represent an
 25991	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanchor.
 25992	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25993	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater, he remarked, sure as nuts. I
 25994	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmust get a wash tomorrow or next day. It’s them black lads I objects to.
 25995	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI hate those buggers. Suck your blood dry, they does.
 25996	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 25997	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSeeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged
 25998	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the
 25999	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmariner’s hope and rest they had a full view of the figure 16 and a
 26000	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyoung man’s sideface looking frowningly rather.
 26001	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26002	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Tattoo, the exhibitor explained. That was done when we were Iying
 26003	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbecalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton. Fellow, the
 26004	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tname of Antonio, done that. There he is himself, a Greek.
 26005	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26006	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Did it hurt much doing it? one asked the sailor.
 26007	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26008	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThat worthy, however, was busily engaged in collecting round the.
 26009	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSomeway in his. Squeezing or.
 26010	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26011	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—See here, he said, showing Antonio. There he is cursing the mate. And
 26012	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthere he is now, he added, the same fellow, pulling the skin with his
 26013	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfingers, some special knack evidently, and he laughing at a yarn.
 26014	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26015	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd in point of fact the young man named Antonio’s livid face did
 26016	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tactually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the
 26017	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunreserved admiration of everybody including Skin-the-Goat, who this
 26018	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttime stretched over.
 26019	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26020	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly chest. He’s gone
 26021	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttoo. Ate by sharks after. Ay, ay.
 26022	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26023	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression
 26024	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof before.
 26025	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26026	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Neat bit of work, one longshoreman said.
 26027	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26028	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And what’s the number for? loafer number two queried.
 26029	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26030	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Eaten alive? a third asked the sailor.
 26031	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26032	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ay, ay, sighed again the latter personage, more cheerily this time with
 26033	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsome sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the direction of
 26034	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe questioner about the number. Ate. A Greek he was.
 26035	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26036	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd then he added with rather gallowsbird humour considering his alleged
 26037	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tend:
 26038	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26039	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t      —As bad as old Antonio,
 26040	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t      For he left me on my ownio.
 26041	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26042	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat
 26043	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpeered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on
 26044	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill. Mr
 26045	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBloom, scarcely knowing which way to look, turned away on the moment
 26046	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tflusterfied but outwardly calm, and, picking up from the table the pink
 26047	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsheet of the Abbey street organ which the jarvey, if such he was, had
 26048	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlaid aside, he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though
 26049	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhy pink. His reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment
 26050	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tround the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that
 26051	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tafternoon on Ormond quay, the partially idiotic female, namely, of the
 26052	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you (Mrs B.)
 26053	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand begged the chance of his washing. Also why washing which seemed
 26054	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trather vague than not, your washing. Still candour compelled him to
 26055	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tadmit he had washed his wife’s undergarments when soiled in Holles
 26056	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstreet and women would and did too a man’s similar garments initialled
 26057	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith Bewley and Draper’s marking ink (hers were, that is) if they really
 26058	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tloved him, that is to say, love me, love my dirty shirt. Still just
 26059	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthen, being on tenterhooks, he desired the female’s room more than her
 26060	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcompany so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude
 26061	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsign to take herself off. Round the side of the Evening Telegraph he
 26062	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjust caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door
 26063	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactly all
 26064	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthere, viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round skipper
 26065	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMurphy’s nautical chest and then there was no more of her.
 26066	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26067	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The gunboat, the keeper said.
 26068	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26069	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am speaking,
 26070	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thow a wretched creature like that from the Lock hospital reeking with
 26071	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdisease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober
 26072	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsenses, if he values his health in the least. Unfortunate creature! Of
 26073	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcourse I suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition.
 26074	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStill no matter what the cause is from...
 26075	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26076	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely
 26077	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tremarking:
 26078	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26079	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—In this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a
 26080	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\troaring trade. Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to
 26081	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbuy the soul. She is a bad merchant. She buys dear and sells cheap.
 26082	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26083	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe elder man, though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude,
 26084	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaid it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a
 26085	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstop to instanter to say that women of that stamp (quite apart from any
 26086	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\toldmaidish squeamishness on the subject), a necessary evil, were not
 26087	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlicensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a thing, he
 26088	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcould truthfully state, he, as a paterfamilias, was a stalwart advocate
 26089	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof from the very first start. Whoever embarked on a policy of the sort,
 26090	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the said, and ventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a lasting
 26091	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tboon on everybody concerned.
 26092	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26093	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You as a good catholic, he observed, talking of body and soul, believe
 26094	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the soul. Or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as such,
 26095	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas distinct from any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup. I
 26096	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbelieve in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as
 26097	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe convolutions of the grey matter. Otherwise we would never have such
 26098	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinventions as X rays, for instance. Do you?
 26099	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26100	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThus cornered, Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try
 26101	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand concentrate and remember before he could say:
 26102	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26103	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—They tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and
 26104	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttherefore incorruptible. It would be immortal, I understand, but for the
 26105	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpossibility of its annihilation by its First Cause Who, from all I
 26106	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcan hear, is quite capable of adding that to the number of His other
 26107	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpractical jokes, corruptio per se and corruptio per accidens both being
 26108	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\texcluded by court etiquette.
 26109	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26110	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the
 26111	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still
 26112	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly
 26113	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trejoining:
 26114	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26115	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Simple? I shouldn’t think that is the proper word. Of course, I grant
 26116	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou, to concede a point, you do knock across a simple soul once in a
 26117	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblue moon. But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for
 26118	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinstance to invent those rays Röntgen did or the telescope like Edison,
 26119	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthough I believe it was before his time Galileo was the man, I mean,
 26120	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand the same applies to the laws, for example, of a farreaching natural
 26121	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tphenomenon such as electricity but it’s a horse of quite another colour
 26122	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto say you believe in the existence of a supernatural God.
 26123	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26124	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—O that, Stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively by several
 26125	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the bestknown passages in Holy Writ, apart from circumstantial
 26126	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tevidence.
 26127	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26128	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOn this knotty point however the views of the pair, poles apart as they
 26129	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference in
 26130	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir respective ages, clashed.
 26131	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26132	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Has been? the more experienced of the two objected, sticking to his
 26133	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\toriginal point with a smile of unbelief. I’m not so sure about that.
 26134	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThat’s a matter for everyman’s opinion and, without dragging in the
 26135	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsectarian side of the business, I beg to differ with you in toto there.
 26136	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMy belief is, to tell you the candid truth, that those bits were genuine
 26137	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tforgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it’s the big
 26138	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tquestion of our national poet over again, who precisely wrote them like
 26139	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHamlet and Bacon, as, you who know your Shakespeare infinitely better
 26140	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthan I, of course I needn’t tell you. Can’t you drink that coffee, by
 26141	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe way? Let me stir it. And take a piece of that bun. It’s like one
 26142	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof our skipper’s bricks disguised. Still no-one can give what he hasn’t
 26143	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgot. Try a bit.
 26144	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26145	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Couldn’t, Stephen contrived to get out, his mental organs for the
 26146	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmoment refusing to dictate further.
 26147	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26148	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFaultfinding being a proverbially bad hat Mr Bloom thought well to stir
 26149	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tor try to the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with something
 26150	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tapproaching acrimony on the Coffee Palace and its temperance (and
 26151	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlucrative) work. To be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or
 26152	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnay did a world of good, shelters such as the present one they were in
 26153	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trun on teetotal lines for vagrants at night, concerts, dramatic evenings
 26154	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand useful lectures (admittance free) by qualified men for the lower
 26155	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\torders. On the other hand he had a distinct and painful recollection
 26156	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey paid his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy who had been prominently
 26157	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tassociated with it at one time, a very modest remuneration indeed for
 26158	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther pianoplaying. The idea, he was strongly inclined to believe, was
 26159	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto do good and net a profit, there being no competition to speak
 26160	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof. Sulphate of copper poison SO4 or something in some dried peas he
 26161	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tremembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he couldn’t
 26162	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tremember when it was or where. Anyhow inspection, medical inspection,
 26163	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof all eatables seemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly
 26164	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\taccounted for the vogue of Dr Tibble’s Vi-Cocoa on account of the
 26165	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmedical analysis involved.
 26166	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26167	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after being
 26168	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstirred.
 26169	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26170	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThus prevailed on to at any rate taste it Stephen lifted the heavy mug
 26171	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle and
 26172	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttook a sip of the offending beverage.
 26173	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26174	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Still it’s solid food, his good genius urged, I’m a stickler for solid
 26175	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfood, his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but
 26176	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tregular meals as the sine qua non for any kind of proper work, mental
 26177	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tor manual. You ought to eat more solid food. You would feel a different
 26178	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tman.
 26179	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26180	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Liquids I can eat, Stephen said. But O, oblige me by taking away that
 26181	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknife. I can’t look at the point of it. It reminds me of Roman history.
 26182	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26183	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article,
 26184	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly Roman or
 26185	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tantique about it to the lay eye, observing that the point was the least
 26186	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconspicuous point about it.
 26187	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26188	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Our mutual friend’s stories are like himself, Mr Bloom apropos of
 26189	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknives remarked to his confidante sotto voce. Do you think they are
 26190	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgenuine? He could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and
 26191	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlie like old boots. Look at him.
 26192	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26193	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tYet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was
 26194	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfull of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it
 26195	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an
 26196	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tentire fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent
 26197	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprobability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly
 26198	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\taccurate gospel.
 26199	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26200	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and
 26201	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him. Though a
 26202	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twellpreserved man of no little stamina, if a trifle prone to baldness,
 26203	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthere was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail
 26204	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdelivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate
 26205	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuch a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity. He
 26206	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmight even have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told,
 26207	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas people often did about others, namely, that he killed him himself
 26208	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand had served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say
 26209	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnothing of the Antonio personage (no relation to the dramatic personage
 26210	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof identical name who sprang from the pen of our national poet) who
 26211	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\texpiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above described. On the
 26212	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tother hand he might be only bluffing, a pardonable weakness because
 26213	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmeeting unmistakable mugs, Dublin residents, like those jarvies waiting
 26214	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnews from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean
 26215	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tseas to draw the long bow about the schooner Hesperus and etcetera. And
 26216	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhen all was said and done the lies a fellow told about himself couldn’t
 26217	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprobably hold a proverbial candle to the wholesale whoppers other
 26218	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfellows coined about him.
 26219	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26220	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Mind you, I’m not saying that it’s all a pure invention, he resumed.
 26221	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnalogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met with. Giants,
 26222	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthough that is rather a far cry, you see once in a way, Marcella the
 26223	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmidget queen. In those waxworks in Henry street I myself saw some
 26224	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAztecs, as they are called, sitting bowlegged, they couldn’t straighten
 26225	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir legs if you paid them because the muscles here, you see, he
 26226	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tproceeded, indicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews
 26227	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tor whatever you like to call them behind the right knee, were utterly
 26228	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpowerless from sitting that way so long cramped up, being adored as
 26229	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgods. There’s an example again of simple souls.
 26230	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26231	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHowever reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures (who
 26232	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\treminded him a bit of Ludwig, alias Ledwidge, when he occupied
 26233	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe boards of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the
 26234	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmanagement in the Flying Dutchman, a stupendous success, and his host
 26235	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof admirers came in large numbers, everyone simply flocking to hear him
 26236	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthough ships of any sort, phantom or the reverse, on the stage usually
 26237	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfell a bit flat as also did trains) there was nothing intrinsically
 26238	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tincompatible about it, he conceded. On the contrary that stab in the
 26239	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tback touch was quite in keeping with those italianos though candidly he
 26240	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas none the less free to admit those icecreamers and friers in the fish
 26241	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tway not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in little
 26242	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tItaly there near the Coombe were sober thrifty hardworking fellows
 26243	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\texcept perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless necessary
 26244	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanimal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to have a good
 26245	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\told succulent tuckin with garlic de rigueur off him or her next day on
 26246	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe quiet and, he added, on the cheap.
 26247	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26248	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Spaniards, for instance, he continued, passionate temperaments like
 26249	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat, impetuous as Old Nick, are given to taking the law into their own
 26250	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they
 26251	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcarry in the abdomen. It comes from the great heat, climate generally.
 26252	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMy wife is, so to speak, Spanish, half that is. Point of fact she could
 26253	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tactually claim Spanish nationality if she wanted, having been born in
 26254	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t(technically) Spain, i.e. Gibraltar. She has the Spanish type. Quite
 26255	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdark, regular brunette, black. I for one certainly believe climate
 26256	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\taccounts for character. That’s why I asked you if you wrote your poetry
 26257	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin Italian.
 26258	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26259	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The temperaments at the door, Stephen interposed with, were very
 26260	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpassionate about ten shillings. Roberto ruba roba sua.
 26261	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26262	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Quite so, Mr Bloom dittoed.
 26263	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26264	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Then, Stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown
 26265	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlistener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isosceles
 26266	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttriangle miss Portinari he fell in love with and Leonardo and san
 26267	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTommaso Mastino.
 26268	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26269	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—It’s in the blood, Mr Bloom acceded at once. All are washed in the
 26270	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblood of the sun. Coincidence I just happened to be in the Kildare
 26271	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstreet museum today, shortly prior to our meeting if I can so call it,
 26272	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand I was just looking at those antique statues there. The splendid
 26273	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tproportions of hips, bosom. You simply don’t knock against those kind of
 26274	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twomen here. An exception here and there. Handsome yes, pretty in a way
 26275	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou find but what I’m talking about is the female form. Besides they
 26276	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thave so little taste in dress, most of them, which greatly enhances a
 26277	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twoman’s natural beauty, no matter what you say. Rumpled stockings, it
 26278	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmay be, possibly is, a foible of mine but still it’s a thing I simply
 26279	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thate to see.
 26280	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26281	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tInterest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the
 26282	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tothers got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog,
 26283	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcollisions with icebergs, all that sort of thing. Shipahoy of course
 26284	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad his own say to say. He had doubled the cape a few odd times and
 26285	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tweathered a monsoon, a kind of wind, in the China seas and through all
 26286	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthose perils of the deep there was one thing, he declared, stood to him
 26287	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tor words to that effect, a pious medal he had that saved him.
 26288	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26289	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSo then after that they drifted on to the wreck off Daunt’s rock, wreck
 26290	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof that illfated Norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for
 26291	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry Campbell
 26292	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tremembered it Palme on Booterstown strand. That was the talk of the town
 26293	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat year (Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of
 26294	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdistinctive merit on the topic for the Irish Times), breakers running
 26295	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tover her and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified with
 26296	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thorror. Then someone said something about the case of the s. s. Lady
 26297	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCairns of Swansea run into by the Mona which was on an opposite tack
 26298	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin rather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck. No aid was
 26299	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgiven. Her master, the Mona’s, said he was afraid his collision bulkhead
 26300	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould give way. She had no water, it appears, in her hold.
 26301	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26302	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAt this stage an incident happened. It having become necessary for him
 26303	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat.
 26304	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26305	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Let me cross your bows mate, he said to his neighbour who was just
 26306	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgently dropping off into a peaceful doze.
 26307	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26308	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe made tracks heavily, slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door,
 26309	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore
 26310	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdue left. While he was in the act of getting his bearings Mr Bloom who
 26311	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnoticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship’s
 26312	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his
 26313	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tburning interior, saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew and,
 26314	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tapplying its nozz1e to his lips, take a good old delectable swig out of
 26315	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit with a gurgling noise. The irrepressible Bloom, who also had a
 26316	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manœuvre after the
 26317	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcounterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared
 26318	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto all intents and purposes, could by straining just perceive him, when
 26319	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tduly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit, gaping up at the piers and
 26320	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgirders of the Loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was all
 26321	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tradically altered since his last visit and greatly improved. Some person
 26322	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tor persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by the
 26323	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a brief
 26324	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspace of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor, evidently
 26325	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgiving it a wide berth, eased himself closer at hand, the noise of his
 26326	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where
 26327	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank. A hoof scooped anyway for
 26328	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnew foothold after sleep and harness jingled. Slightly disturbed in his
 26329	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of the corporation
 26330	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstones who, though now broken down and fast breaking up, was none other
 26331	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin stern reality than the Gumley aforesaid, now practically on the
 26332	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tparish rates, given the temporary job by Pat Tobin in all human
 26333	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprobability from dictates of humanity knowing him before shifted about
 26334	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again in to the arms
 26335	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof Morpheus, a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its most virulent
 26336	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tform on a fellow most respectably connected and familiarised with decent
 26337	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thome comforts all his life who came in for a cool £ 100 a year at one
 26338	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttime which of course the doublebarrelled ass proceeded to make general
 26339	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tducks and drakes of. And there he was at the end of his tether after
 26340	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thaving often painted the town tolerably pink without a beggarly stiver.
 26341	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe drank needless to be told and it pointed only once more a moral
 26342	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhen he might quite easily be in a large way of business if—a big if,
 26343	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thowever—he had contrived to cure himself of his particular partiality.
 26344	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26345	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAll meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in Irish shipping,
 26346	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcoastwise and foreign as well, which was all part and parcel of the same
 26347	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthing. A Palgrave Murphy boat was put off the ways at Alexandra basin,
 26348	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe only launch that year. Right enough the harbours were there only no
 26349	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tships ever called.
 26350	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26351	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThere were wrecks and wreckers, the keeper said, who was evidently au
 26352	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfait.
 26353	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26354	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhat he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only
 26355	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trock in Galway bay when the Galway harbour scheme was mooted by a Mr
 26356	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWorthington or some name like that, eh? Ask the then captain, he advised
 26357	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem, how much palmoil the British government gave him for that day’s
 26358	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twork, Captain John Lever of the Lever Line.
 26359	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26360	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Am I right, skipper? he queried of the sailor, now returning after his
 26361	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprivate potation and the rest of his exertions.
 26362	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26363	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThat worthy picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words
 26364	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgrowled in wouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or other
 26365	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin seconds or thirds. Mr Bloom’s sharp ears heard him then expectorate
 26366	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe plug probably (which it was), so that he must have lodged it for the
 26367	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttime being in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs
 26368	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in question. Anyhow in
 26369	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the rolled after his successful libation-cum-potation, introducing an
 26370	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tatmosphere of drink into the soirée, boisterously trolling, like a
 26371	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tveritable son of a seacook:
 26372	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26373	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     —The biscuits was as hard as brass
 26374	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     And the beef as salt as Lot’s wife’s arse.
 26375	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     O, Johnny Lever!
 26376	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     Johnny Lever, O!
 26377	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26378	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAfter which effusion the redoubtable specimen duly arrived on the scene
 26379	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand regaining his seat he sank rather than sat heavily on the form
 26380	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprovided. Skin-the-Goat, assuming he was he, evidently with an axe to
 26381	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgrind, was airing his grievances in a forcible-feeble philippic anent
 26382	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe natural resources of Ireland or something of that sort which he
 26383	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdescribed in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none on
 26384	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe face of God’s earth, far and away superior to England, with coal in
 26385	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlarge quantities, six million pounds worth of pork exported every year,
 26386	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained out of
 26387	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit by England levying taxes on the poor people that paid through the
 26388	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnose always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot more
 26389	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsurplus steam in the same vein. Their conversation accordingly became
 26390	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgeneral and all agreed that that was a fact. You could grow any mortal
 26391	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthing in Irish soil, he stated, and there was that colonel Everard down
 26392	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthere in Navan growing tobacco. Where would you find anywhere the like
 26393	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof Irish bacon? But a day of reckoning, he stated crescendo with no
 26394	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tuncertain voice, thoroughly monopolising all the conversation, was in
 26395	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstore for mighty England, despite her power of pelf on account of her
 26396	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcrimes. There would be a fall and the greatest fall in history.
 26397	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe Germans and the Japs were going to have their little lookin, he
 26398	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\taffirmed. The Boers were the beginning of the end. Brummagem England was
 26399	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttoppling already and her downfall would be Ireland, her Achilles heel,
 26400	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhich he explained to them about the vulnerable point of Achilles, the
 26401	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tGreek hero, a point his auditors at once seized as he completely gripped
 26402	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir attention by showing the tendon referred to on his boot. His
 26403	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tadvice to every Irishman was: stay in the land of your birth and work
 26404	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor Ireland and live for Ireland. Ireland, Parnell said, could not spare
 26405	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta single one of her sons.
 26406	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26407	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSilence all round marked the termination of his finale. The impervious
 26408	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnavigator heard these lurid tidings, undismayed.
 26409	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26410	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Take a bit of doing, boss, retaliated that rough diamond palpably a bit
 26411	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpeeved in response to the foregoing truism.
 26412	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26413	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTo which cold douche referring to downfall and so on the keeper
 26414	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconcurred but nevertheless held to his main view.
 26415	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26416	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Who’s the best troops in the army? the grizzled old veteran irately
 26417	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinterrogated. And the best jumpers and racers? And the best admirals and
 26418	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgenerals we’ve got? Tell me that.
 26419	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26420	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The Irish, for choice, retorted the cabby like Campbell, facial
 26421	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblemishes apart.
 26422	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26423	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That’s right, the old tarpaulin corroborated. The Irish catholic
 26424	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpeasant. He’s the backbone of our empire. You know Jem Mullins?
 26425	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26426	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhile allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added
 26427	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the cared nothing for any empire, ours or his, and considered no Irishman
 26428	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tworthy of his salt that served it. Then they began to have a few
 26429	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tirascible words when it waxed hotter, both, needless to say, appealing
 26430	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto the listeners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long
 26431	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas they didn’t indulge in recriminations and come to blows.
 26432	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26433	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFrom inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloom was
 26434	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for,
 26435	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for, he was
 26436	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel,
 26437	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunless they were much bigger fools than he took them for, rather
 26438	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconcealed their strength than the opposite. It was quite on a par with
 26439	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years
 26440	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if, as
 26441	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttime went on, that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he could
 26442	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpersonally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies,
 26443	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tequally relevant to the issue, might occur ere then it was highly
 26444	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tadvisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countries even
 26445	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthough poles apart. Another little interesting point, the amours of
 26446	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhores and chummies, to put it in common parlance, reminded him Irish
 26447	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsoldiers had as often fought for England as against her, more so, in
 26448	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfact. And now, why? So the scene between the pair of them, the licensee
 26449	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the place rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris, the famous
 26450	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinvincible, and the other, obviously bogus, reminded him forcibly as
 26451	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeing on all fours with the confidence trick, supposing, that is, it was
 26452	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprearranged as the lookeron, a student of the human soul if anything,
 26453	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe others seeing least of the game. And as for the lessee or keeper,
 26454	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twho probably wasn’t the other person at all, he (B.) couldn’t help
 26455	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfeeling and most properly it was better to give people like that the
 26456	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgoby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and refuse to have
 26457	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and their
 26458	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfelonsetting, there always being the offchance of a Dannyman coming
 26459	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tforward and turning queen’s evidence or king’s now like Denis or Peter
 26460	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCarey, an idea he utterly repudiated. Quite apart from that he disliked
 26461	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthose careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle. Yet, though such
 26462	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcriminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any
 26463	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshape or form, he certainly did feel and no denying it (while inwardly
 26464	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tremaining what he was) a certain kind of admiration for a man who
 26465	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad actually brandished a knife, cold steel, with the courage of his
 26466	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpolitical convictions (though, personally, he would never be a party to
 26467	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tany such thing), off the same bat as those love vendettas of the south,
 26468	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thave her or swing for her, when the husband frequently, after some words
 26469	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpassed between the two concerning her relations with the other lucky
 26470	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmortal (he having had the pair watched), inflicted fatal injuries on his
 26471	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tadored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial liaison by plunging
 26472	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this knife into her, until it just struck him that Fitz, nicknamed
 26473	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSkin-the-Goat, merely drove the car for the actual perpetrators of the
 26474	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\toutrage and so was not, if he was reliably informed, actually party to
 26475	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe ambush which, in point of fact, was the plea some legal luminary
 26476	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaved his skin on. In any case that was very ancient history by now and
 26477	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas for our friend, the pseudo Skin-the-etcetera, he had transparently
 26478	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\toutlived his welcome. He ought to have either died naturally or on
 26479	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe scaffold high. Like actresses, always farewell positively last
 26480	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tperformance then come up smiling again. Generous to a fault of course,
 26481	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttemperamental, no economising or any idea of the sort, always snapping
 26482	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat the bone for the shadow. So similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion
 26483	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat Mr Johnny Lever got rid of some £. s. d. in the course of his
 26484	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tperambulations round the docks in the congenial atmosphere of the Old
 26485	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIreland tavern, come back to Erin and so on. Then as for the other he
 26486	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad heard not so long before the same identical lingo as he told Stephen
 26487	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thow he simply but effectually silenced the offender.
 26488	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26489	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—He took umbrage at something or other, that muchinjured but on the
 26490	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhole eventempered person declared, I let slip. He called me a jew and
 26491	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin a heated fashion offensively. So I without deviating from plain facts
 26492	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the least told him his God, I mean Christ, was a jew too and all his
 26493	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfamily like me though in reality I’m not. That was one for him. A soft
 26494	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanswer turns away wrath. He hadn’t a word to say for himself as everyone
 26495	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaw. Am I not right?
 26496	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26497	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous dark pride
 26498	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to
 26499	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglean in a kind of a way that it wasn’t all exactly.
 26500	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26501	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ex quibus, Stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent, their two or four
 26502	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\teyes conversing, Christus or Bloom his name is or after all any other,
 26503	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsecundum carnem.
 26504	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26505	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Of course, Mr B. proceeded to stipulate, you must look at both sides of
 26506	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe question. It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right
 26507	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is
 26508	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthough every country, they say, our own distressful included, has the
 26509	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgovernment it deserves. But with a little goodwill all round. It’s all
 26510	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvery fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality.
 26511	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI resent violence and intolerance in any shape or form. It never
 26512	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\treaches anything or stops anything. A revolution must come on the due
 26513	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinstalments plan. It’s a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate
 26514	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpeople because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular,
 26515	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the next house so to speak.
 26516	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26517	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes’ war, Stephen
 26518	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tassented, between Skinner’s alley and Ormond market.
 26519	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26520	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tYes, Mr Bloom thoroughly agreed, entirely endorsing the remark, that
 26521	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas overwhelmingly right. And the whole world was full of that sort of
 26522	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthing.
 26523	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26524	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You just took the words out of my mouth, he said. A hocuspocus of
 26525	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconflicting evidence that candidly you couldn’t remotely...
 26526	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26527	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAll those wretched quarrels, in his humble opinion, stirring up
 26528	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbad blood, from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind,
 26529	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\terroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag, were
 26530	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvery largely a question of the money question which was at the back of
 26531	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\teverything greed and jealousy, people never knowing when to stop.
 26532	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26533	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—They accuse, remarked he audibly.
 26534	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26535	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe turned away from the others who probably and spoke nearer to, so as
 26536	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe others in case they.
 26537	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26538	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Jews, he softly imparted in an aside in Stephen’s ear, are accused of
 26539	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\truining. Not a vestige of truth in it, I can safely say. History, would
 26540	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou be surprised to learn, proves up to the hilt Spain decayed when the
 26541	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinquisition hounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell,
 26542	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tan uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer for,
 26543	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\timported them. Why? Because they are imbued with the proper spirit. They
 26544	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tare practical and are proved to be so. I don’t want to indulge in any
 26545	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbecause you know the standard works on the subject and then orthodox as
 26546	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyou are. But in the economic, not touching religion, domain the priest
 26547	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspells poverty. Spain again, you saw in the war, compared with goahead
 26548	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAmerica. Turks. It’s in the dogma. Because if they didn’t believe they’d
 26549	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgo straight to heaven when they die they’d try to live better, at least
 26550	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tso I think. That’s the juggle on which the p.p.‘s raise the wind
 26551	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton false pretences. I’m, he resumed with dramatic force, as good an
 26552	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIrishman as that rude person I told you about at the outset and I want
 26553	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto see everyone, concluded he, all creeds and classes pro rata having a
 26554	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcomfortable tidysized income, in no niggard fashion either, something
 26555	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the neighbourhood of £ 300 per annum. That’s the vital issue at stake
 26556	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand it’s feasible and would be provocative of friendlier intercourse
 26557	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbetween man and man. At least that’s my idea for what it’s worth. I
 26558	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcall that patriotism. Ubi patria, as we learned a smattering of in our
 26559	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tclassical days in Alma Mater, vita bene. Where you can live well, the
 26560	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsense is, if you work.
 26561	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26562	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOver his untastable apology for a cup of coffee, listening to this
 26563	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsynopsis of things in general, Stephen stared at nothing in particular.
 26564	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe could hear, of course, all kinds of words changing colour like those
 26565	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcrabs about Ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours
 26566	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere
 26567	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeneath or seemed to. Then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or
 26568	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdidn’t say the words the voice he heard said, if you work.
 26569	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26570	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Count me out, he managed to remark, meaning work.
 26571	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26572	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe eyes were surprised at this observation because as he, the person
 26573	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twho owned them pro tem. observed or rather his voice speaking did, all
 26574	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmust work, have to, together.
 26575	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26576	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I mean, of course, the other hastened to affirm, work in the widest
 26577	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpossible sense. Also literary labour not merely for the kudos of
 26578	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe thing. Writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel
 26579	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnowadays. That’s work too. Important work. After all, from the little
 26580	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI know of you, after all the money expended on your education you are
 26581	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tentitled to recoup yourself and command your price. You have every bit
 26582	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the
 26583	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpeasant has. What? You both belong to Ireland, the brain and the brawn.
 26584	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tEach is equally important.
 26585	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26586	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—You suspect, Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh, that I
 26587	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmay be important because I belong to the faubourg Saint Patrice called
 26588	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIreland for short.
 26589	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26590	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I would go a step farther, Mr Bloom insinuated.
 26591	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26592	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—But I suspect, Stephen interrupted, that Ireland must be important
 26593	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbecause it belongs to me.
 26594	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26595	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What belongs, queried Mr Bloom bending, fancying he was perhaps under
 26596	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsome misapprehension. Excuse me. Unfortunately, I didn’t catch the
 26597	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlatter portion. What was it you...?
 26598	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26599	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mug of
 26600	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcoffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely, adding:
 26601	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26602	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—We can’t change the country. Let us change the subject.
 26603	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26604	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAt this pertinent suggestion Mr Bloom, to change the subject, looked
 26605	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdown but in a quandary, as he couldn’t tell exactly what construction
 26606	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry. The rebuke of some
 26607	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tkind was clearer than the other part. Needless to say the fumes of
 26608	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way
 26609	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tforeign to his sober state. Probably the homelife to which Mr B attached
 26610	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe utmost importance had not been all that was needful or he hadn’t
 26611	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbeen familiarised with the right sort of people. With a touch of fear
 26612	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor the young man beside him whom he furtively scrutinised with an air
 26613	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof some consternation remembering he had just come back from Paris,
 26614	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister,
 26615	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfailing to throw much light on the subject, however, he brought to mind
 26616	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinstances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in the
 26617	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbud of premature decay and nobody to blame but themselves. For instance
 26618	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthere was the case of O’Callaghan, for one, the halfcrazy faddist,
 26619	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trespectably connected though of inadequate means, with his mad vagaries
 26620	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tamong whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a nuisance
 26621	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting
 26622	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin public a suit of brown paper (a fact). And then the usual dénouement
 26623	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tafter the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed into hot water
 26624	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand had to be spirited away by a few friends, after a strong hint to a
 26625	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblind horse from John Mallon of Lower Castle Yard, so as not to be made
 26626	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tamenable under section two of the criminal law amendment act, certain
 26627	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnames of those subpœnaed being handed in but not divulged for reasons
 26628	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhich will occur to anyone with a pick of brains. Briefly, putting two
 26629	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand two together, six sixteen which he pointedly turned a deaf ear to,
 26630	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAntonio and so forth, jockeys and esthetes and the tattoo which was
 26631	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall the go in the seventies or thereabouts even in the house of lords
 26632	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbecause early in life the occupant of the throne, then heir apparent,
 26633	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe other members of the upper ten and other high personages simply
 26634	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfollowing in the footsteps of the head of the state, he reflected about
 26635	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe errors of notorieties and crowned heads running counter to morality
 26636	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuch as the Cornwall case a number of years before under their veneer in
 26637	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta way scarcely intended by nature, a thing good Mrs Grundy, as the law
 26638	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstands, was terribly down on though not for the reason they thought
 26639	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey were probably whatever it was except women chiefly who were always
 26640	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfiddling more or less at one another it being largely a matter of
 26641	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdress and all the rest of it. Ladies who like distinctive underclothing
 26642	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshould, and every welltailored man must, trying to make the gap wider
 26643	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbetween them by innuendo and give more of a genuine filip to acts of
 26644	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\timpropriety between the two, she unbuttoned his and then he untied her,
 26645	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmind the pin, whereas savages in the cannibal islands, say, at ninety
 26646	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdegrees in the shade not caring a continental. However, reverting to the
 26647	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\toriginal, there were on the other hand others who had forced their way
 26648	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto the top from the lowest rung by the aid of their bootstraps. Sheer
 26649	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tforce of natural genius, that. With brains, sir.
 26650	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26651	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFor which and further reasons he felt it was his interest and duty even
 26652	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto wait on and profit by the unlookedfor occasion though why he could
 26653	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnot exactly tell being as it was already several shillings to the
 26654	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbad having in fact let himself in for it. Still to cultivate the
 26655	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tacquaintance of someone of no uncommon calibre who could provide food
 26656	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor reflection would amply repay any small. Intellectual stimulation,
 26657	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas such, was, he felt, from time to time a firstrate tonic for the mind.
 26658	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAdded to which was the coincidence of meeting, discussion, dance, row,

 26741	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26742	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—There was every indication they would arrive at that, he, Bloom, said.
 26743	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26744	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Who? the other, whose hand by the way was hurt, said.
 26745	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26746	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOne morning you would open the paper, the cabman affirmed, and read:
 26747	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tReturn of Parnell. He bet them what they liked. A Dublin fusilier was in
 26748	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat shelter one night and said he saw him in South Africa. Pride it was
 26749	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tkilled him. He ought to have done away with himself or lain low for a
 26750	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttime after committee room no 15 until he was his old self again with
 26751	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tno-one to point a finger at him. Then they would all to a man have gone
 26752	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdown on their marrowbones to him to come back when he had recovered
 26753	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this senses. Dead he wasn’t. Simply absconded somewhere. The coffin they
 26754	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrought over was full of stones. He changed his name to De Wet, the Boer
 26755	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgeneral. He made a mistake to fight the priests. And so forth and so on.
 26756	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26757	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAll the same Bloom (properly so dubbed) was rather surprised at their
 26758	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmemories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels and
 26759	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnot singly but in their thousands and then complete oblivion because it
 26760	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas twenty odd years. Highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow
 26761	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof truth in the stones and, even supposing, he thought a return highly
 26762	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinadvisable, all things considered. Something evidently riled them in
 26763	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this death. Either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when
 26764	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this various different political arrangements were nearing completion
 26765	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tor whether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to
 26766	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchange his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold resulted and
 26767	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfailing to consult a specialist he being confined to his room till he
 26768	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\teventually died of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at
 26769	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tan end or quite possibly they were distressed to find the job was taken
 26770	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout of their hands. Of course nobody being acquainted with his movements
 26771	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\teven before there was absolutely no clue as to his whereabouts which
 26772	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twere decidedly of the Alice, where art thou order even prior to his
 26773	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstarting to go under several aliases such as Fox and Stewart so the
 26774	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tremark which emanated from friend cabby might be within the bounds of
 26775	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpossibility. Naturally then it would prey on his mind as a born leader
 26776	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof men which undoubtedly he was and a commanding figure, a sixfooter
 26777	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tor at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged feet, whereas
 26778	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMessrs So and So who, though they weren’t even a patch on the former
 26779	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tman, ruled the roost after their redeeming features were very few and
 26780	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfar between. It certainly pointed a moral, the idol with feet of clay,
 26781	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand then seventytwo of his trusty henchmen rounding on him with mutual
 26782	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmudslinging. And the identical same with murderers. You had to come
 26783	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tback. That haunting sense kind of drew you. To show the understudy in
 26784	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe title rôle how to. He saw him once on the auspicious occasion when
 26785	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthey broke up the type in the Insuppressible or was it United Ireland,
 26786	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta privilege he keenly appreciated, and, in point of fact, handed him his
 26787	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsilk hat when it was knocked off and he said Thank you, excited as he
 26788	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tundoubtedly was under his frigid exterior notwithstanding the little
 26789	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmisadventure mentioned between the cup and the lip: what’s bred in the
 26790	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbone. Still as regards return. You were a lucky dog if they didn’t set
 26791	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe terrier at you directly you got back. Then a lot of shillyshally
 26792	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tusually followed, Tom for and Dick and Harry against. And then, number
 26793	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tone, you came up against the man in possession and had to produce your
 26794	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcredentials like the claimant in the Tichborne case, Roger Charles
 26795	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTichborne, Bella was the boat’s name to the best of his recollection
 26796	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the, the heir, went down in as the evidence went to show and there was

 26798	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\teasily have picked up the details from some pal on board ship and then,
 26799	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhen got up to tally with the description given, introduce himself with:
 26800	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tExcuse me, my name is So and So or some such commonplace remark. A more
 26801	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprudent course, as Bloom said to the not over effusive, in fact like the
 26802	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdistinguished personage under discussion beside him, would have been to
 26803	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsound the lie of the land first.
 26804	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26805	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—That bitch, that English whore, did for him, the shebeen proprietor
 26806	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcommented. She put the first nail in his coffin.
 26807	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26808	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Fine lump of a woman all the same, the soi-disant townclerk Henry
 26809	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCampbell remarked, and plenty of her. She loosened many a man’s thighs.
 26810	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tI seen her picture in a barber’s. The husband was a captain or an
 26811	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tofficer.

 26813	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Ay, Skin-the-Goat amusingly added, he was and a cottonball one.
 26814	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26815	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThis gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair
 26816	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tamount of laughter among his entourage. As regards Bloom he, without the
 26817	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfaintest suspicion of a smile, merely gazed in the direction of the door
 26818	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand reflected upon the historic story which had aroused extraordinary
 26819	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinterest at the time when the facts, to make matters worse, were made
 26820	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpublic with the usual affectionate letters that passed between them full
 26821	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof sweet nothings. First it was strictly Platonic till nature intervened
 26822	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand an attachment sprang up between them till bit by bit matters came to
 26823	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta climax and the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering
 26824	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few evildisposed, however,
 26825	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twho were resolved upon encompassing his downfall though the thing was
 26826	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpublic property all along though not to anything like the sensational
 26827	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\textent that it subsequently blossomed into. Since their names were
 26828	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcoupled, though, since he was her declared favourite, where was the
 26829	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tparticular necessity to proclaim it to the rank and file from the
 26830	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thousetops, the fact, namely, that he had shared her bedroom which came
 26831	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went through the packed
 26832	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcourt literally electrifying everybody in the shape of witnesses
 26833	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tswearing to having witnessed him on such and such a particular date in
 26834	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance
 26835	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof a ladder in night apparel, having gained admittance in the same
 26836	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfashion, a fact the weeklies, addicted to the lubric a little, simply
 26837	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcoined shoals of money out of. Whereas the simple fact of the case was
 26838	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit was simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch, with
 26839	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnothing in common between them beyond the name, and then a real man
 26840	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tarriving on the scene, strong to the verge of weakness, falling a victim
 26841	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto her siren charms and forgetting home ties, the usual sequel, to bask
 26842	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the loved one’s smiles. The eternal question of the life connubial,
 26843	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tneedless to say, cropped up. Can real love, supposing there happens to
 26844	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbe another chap in the case, exist between married folk? Poser.
 26845	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThough it was no concern of theirs absolutely if he regarded her with
 26846	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\taffection, carried away by a wave of folly. A magnificent specimen of
 26847	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmanhood he was truly augmented obviously by gifts of a high order, as
 26848	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcompared with the other military supernumerary that is (who was just the
 26849	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tusual everyday farewell, my gallant captain kind of an individual in
 26850	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe light dragoons, the 18th hussars to be accurate) and inflammable
 26851	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdoubtless (the fallen leader, that is, not the other) in his own
 26852	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpeculiar way which she of course, woman, quickly perceived as highly
 26853	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlikely to carve his way to fame which he almost bid fair to do till the
 26854	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpriests and ministers of the gospel as a whole, his erstwhile staunch
 26855	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tadherents, and his beloved evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman
 26856	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tservice in the rural parts of the country by taking up the cudgels on
 26857	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir behalf in a way that exceeded their most sanguine expectations,
 26858	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvery effectually cooked his matrimonial goose, thereby heaping coals of
 26859	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfire on his head much in the same way as the fabled ass’s kick. Looking
 26860	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tback now in a retrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a kind of
 26861	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdream. And then coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it
 26862	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twent without saying you would feel out of place as things always moved
 26863	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith the times. Why, as he reflected, Irishtown strand, a locality he
 26864	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad not been in for quite a number of years looked different somehow
 26865	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsince, as it happened, he went to reside on the north side. North or
 26866	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsouth, however, it was just the wellknown case of hot passion, pure and
 26867	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsimple, upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the
 26868	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvery thing he was saying as she also was Spanish or half so, types that
 26869	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twouldn’t do things by halves, passionate abandon of the south, casting
 26870	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tevery shred of decency to the winds.
 26871	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26872	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Just bears out what I was saying, he, with glowing bosom said to
 26873	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen, about blood and the sun. And, if I don’t greatly mistake she
 26874	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas Spanish too.
 26875	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26876	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The king of Spain’s daughter, Stephen answered, adding something or
 26877	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tother rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you Spanish onions and
 26878	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe first land called the Deadman and from Ramhead to Scilly was so and
 26879	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tso many.
 26880	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26881	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Was she? Bloom ejaculated, surprised though not astonished by any
 26882	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmeans, I never heard that rumour before. Possible, especially there, it
 26883	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas as she lived there. So, Spain.
 26884	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26885	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCarefully avoiding a book in his pocket Sweets of, which reminded him
 26886	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby the by of that Capel street library book out of date, he took out his
 26887	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpocketbook and, turning over the various contents it contained rapidly
 26888	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfinally he.
 26889	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26890	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Do you consider, by the by, he said, thoughtfully selecting a faded
 26891	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tphoto which he laid on the table, that a Spanish type?
 26892	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26893	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen, obviously addressed, looked down on the photo showing a large
 26894	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she
 26895	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously
 26896	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlow for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom, with more than
 26897	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvision of breasts, her full lips parted and some perfect teeth, standing
 26898	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnear, ostensibly with gravity, a piano on the rest of which was In Old
 26899	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMadrid, a ballad, pretty in its way, which was then all the vogue. Her
 26900	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t(the lady’s) eyes, dark, large, looked at Stephen, about to smile about
 26901	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsomething to be admired, Lafayette of Westmoreland street, Dublin’s
 26902	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpremier photographic artist, being responsible for the esthetic

 26911	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBrian Tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a
 26912	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsinger having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered
 26913	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbarely sweet sixteen. As for the face it was a speaking likeness in
 26914	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\texpression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a
 26915	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage
 26916	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin that getup. She could without difficulty, he said, have posed for the
 26917	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tensemble, not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the. He dwelt, being
 26918	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta bit of an artist in his spare time, on the female form in general
 26919	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdevelopmentally because, as it so happened, no later than that afternoon
 26920	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the had seen those Grecian statues, perfectly developed as works of art,
 26921	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin the National Museum. Marble could give the original, shoulders, back,
 26922	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tall the symmetry, all the rest. Yes, puritanisme, it does though Saint
 26923	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJoseph’s sovereign thievery alors (Bandez!) Figne toi trop. Whereas no
 26924	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tphoto could because it simply wasn’t art in a word.
 26925	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26926	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow Jack Tar’s good
 26927	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\texample and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for
 26928	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\titself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the beauty for
 26929	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thimself, her stage presence being, frankly, a treat in itself which the
 26930	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcamera could not at all do justice to. But it was scarcely professional
 26931	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tetiquette so. Though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet
 26932	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twonderfully cool for the season considering, for sunshine after storm.
 26933	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnd he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a
 26934	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tkind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion.
 26935	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased
 26936	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby opulent curves, none the worse for wear however, and looked away
 26937	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthoughtfully with the intention of not further increasing the other’s
 26938	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpossible embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving embonpoint.
 26939	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIn fact the slight soiling was only an added charm like the case of
 26940	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlinen slightly soiled, good as new, much better in fact with the starch
 26941	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tout. Suppose she was gone when he? I looked for the lamp which she told
 26942	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tme came into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of his because he
 26943	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthen recollected the morning littered bed etcetera and the book about

 26945	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsufficiently appropriately beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies

 26947	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 26948	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe vicinity of the young man he certainly relished, educated, distingué
 26949	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick of the bunch
 26950	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthough you wouldn’t think he had it in him yet you would. Besides he
 26951	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaid the picture was handsome which, say what you like, it was though
 26952	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat the moment she was distinctly stouter. And why not? An awful lot of
 26953	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmakebelieve went on about that sort of thing involving a lifelong slur
 26954	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith the usual splash page of gutterpress about the same old matrimonial
 26955	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttangle alleging misconduct with professional golfer or the newest
 26956	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstage favourite instead of being honest and aboveboard about the whole
 26957	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbusiness. How they were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up
 26958	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbetween the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye
 26959	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy and
 26960	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcompromising expressions leaving no loophole to show that they openly
 26961	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and
 26962	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trelations, when the thing ran its normal course, became in due course
 26963	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tintimate. Then the decree nisi and the King’s proctor tries to show
 26964	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcause why and, he failing to quash it, nisi was made absolute. But as
 26965	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor that the two misdemeanants, wrapped up as they largely were in one
 26966	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanother, could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did till
 26967	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe matter was put in the hands of a solicitor who filed a petition for
 26968	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe party wronged in due course. He, B, enjoyed the distinction of being
 26969	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tclose to Erin’s uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred on
 26970	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe historic fracas when the fallen leader’s, who notoriously stuck to
 26971	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery,
 26972	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t(leader’s) trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or
 26973	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpossibly even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the
 26974	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tInsuppressible or no it was United Ireland (a by no means by the by
 26975	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tappropriate appellative) and broke up the typecases with hammers or
 26976	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsomething like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from
 26977	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe facile pens of the O’Brienite scribes at the usual mudslinging
 26978	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\toccupation reflecting on the erstwhile tribune’s private morals. Though
 26979	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpalpably a radically altered man he was still a commanding figure though
 26980	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcarelessly garbed as usual with that look of settled purpose which went
 26981	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta long way with the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast
 26982	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdiscomfiture that their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a
 26983	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpedestal which she, however, was the first to perceive. As those were
 26984	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tparticularly hot times in the general hullaballoo Bloom sustained a
 26985	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tminor injury from a nasty prod of some chap’s elbow in the crowd that
 26986	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof course congregated lodging some place about the pit of the stomach,
 26987	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfortunately not of a grave character. His hat (Parnell’s) a silk one was
 26988	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinadvertently knocked off and, as a matter of strict history, Bloom was
 26989	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence
 26990	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmeaning to return it to him (and return it to him he did with the utmost
 26991	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcelerity) who panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away
 26992	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom his hat at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a
 26993	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstake in the country he, as a matter of fact, having gone into it more
 26994	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor the kudos of the thing than anything else, what’s bred in the bone
 26995	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinstilled into him in infancy at his mother’s knee in the shape of
 26996	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tknowing what good form was came out at once because he turned round to
 26997	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe donor and thanked him with perfect aplomb, saying: Thank you, sir,
 26998	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthough in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal
 26999	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprofession whose headgear Bloom also set to rights earlier in the course
 27000	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the day, history repeating itself with a difference, after the burial
 27001	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory after the
 27002	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgrim task of having committed his remains to the grave.
 27003	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 27004	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOn the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant
 27005	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjokes of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest, laughing
 27006	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\timmoderately, pretending to understand everything, the why and the
 27007	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twherefore, and in reality not knowing their own minds, it being a case
 27008	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate
 27009	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thusband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from
 27010	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe usual boy Jones, who happened to come across them at the crucial
 27011	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmoment in a loving position locked in one another’s arms, drawing
 27012	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tattention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic
 27013	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord and
 27014	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmaster upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not
 27015	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\treceive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would overlook
 27016	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes though
 27017	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpossibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as quite
 27018	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpossibly there were several others. He personally, being of a sceptical
 27019	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbias, believed and didn’t make the smallest bones about saying so either
 27020	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat man or men in the plural were always hanging around on the waiting
 27021	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlist about a lady, even supposing she was the best wife in the world
 27022	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand they got on fairly well together for the sake of argument, when,
 27023	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tneglecting her duties, she chose to be tired of wedded life and was on
 27024	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on
 27025	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ther with improper intent, the upshot being that her affections centred
 27026	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton another, the cause of many liaisons between still attractive married
 27027	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twomen getting on for fair and forty and younger men, no doubt as several
 27028	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfamous cases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt.
 27029	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 27030	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIt was a thousand pities a young fellow, blessed with an allowance of
 27031	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrains as his neighbour obviously was, should waste his valuable time
 27032	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last him
 27033	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\this lifetime. In the nature of single blessedness he would one day take
 27034	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunto himself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the interim
 27035	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tladies’ society was a conditio sine qua non though he had the gravest
 27036	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpossible doubts, not that he wanted in the smallest to pump Stephen
 27037	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabout Miss Ferguson (who was very possibly the particular lodestar who
 27038	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrought him down to Irishtown so early in the morning), as to whether he
 27039	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twould find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea
 27040	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand the company of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi or
 27041	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttriweekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentplaying and
 27042	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twalking out leading up to fond lovers’ ways and flowers and chocs. To
 27043	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthink of him house and homeless, rooked by some landlady worse than any
 27044	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstepmother, was really too bad at his age. The queer suddenly things
 27045	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the popped out with attracted the elder man who was several years the
 27046	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tother’s senior or like his father but something substantial he certainly
 27047	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tought to eat even were it only an eggflip made on unadulterated maternal
 27048	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnutriment or, failing that, the homely Humpty Dumpty boiled.
 27049	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 27050	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—At what o’clock did you dine? he questioned of the slim form and tired
 27051	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthough unwrinkled face.
 27052	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 27053	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Some time yesterday, Stephen said.
 27054	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 27055	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yesterday! exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow
 27056	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFriday. Ah, you mean it’s after twelve!
 27057	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 27058	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—The day before yesterday, Stephen said, improving on himself.
 27059	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 27060	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLiterally astounded at this piece of intelligence Bloom reflected.
 27061	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThough they didn’t see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there
 27062	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsomehow was as if both their minds were travelling, so to speak, in the
 27063	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tone train of thought. At his age when dabbling in politics roughly
 27064	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsome score of years previously when he had been a quasi aspirant to
 27065	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tparliamentary honours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in
 27066	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tretrospect (which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself) he had
 27067	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas. For instance when the
 27068	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tevicted tenants question, then at its first inception, bulked largely in
 27069	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpeople’s mind though, it goes without saying, not contributing a copper
 27070	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tor pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some of which wouldn’t
 27071	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\texactly hold water, he at the outset in principle at all events was in
 27072	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the trend of modern
 27073	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\topinion (a partiality, however, which, realising his mistake, he was
 27074	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsubsequently partially cured of) and even was twitted with going a
 27075	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstep farther than Michael Davitt in the striking views he at one time
 27076	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he strongly
 27077	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tresented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion by our
 27078	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfriend at the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernan’s so that he,
 27079	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthough often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of
 27080	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmortals, be it repeated, departed from his customary habit to give
 27081	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim (metaphorically) one in the gizzard though, so far as politics
 27082	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthemselves were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualties
 27083	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinvariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity
 27084	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on
 27085	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word.
 27086	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 27087	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons, getting on for one, as it
 27088	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas, it was high time to be retiring for the night. The crux was it
 27089	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twas a bit risky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue
 27090	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t(somebody having a temper of her own sometimes) and spoil the hash
 27091	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\taltogether as on the night he misguidedly brought home a dog (breed
 27092	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunknown) with a lame paw (not that the cases were either identical or
 27093	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe reverse though he had hurt his hand too) to Ontario Terrace as he
 27094	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvery distinctly remembered, having been there, so to speak. On the
 27095	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tother hand it was altogether far and away too late for the Sandymount
 27096	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tor Sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of
 27097	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe two alternatives. Everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him
 27098	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto avail himself to the full of the opportunity, all things considered.
 27099	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHis initial impression was he was a shade standoffish or not over
 27100	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\teffusive but it grew on him someway. For one thing he mightn’t what you
 27101	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcall jump at the idea, if approached, and what mostly worried him was
 27102	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the didn’t know how to lead up to it or word it exactly, supposing he
 27103	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdid entertain the proposal, as it would afford him very great personal
 27104	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some
 27105	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twardrobe, if found suitable. At all events he wound up by concluding,
 27106	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\teschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent, a cup of Epps’s cocoa and
 27107	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat
 27108	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdoubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands and as warm as
 27109	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta toast on a trivet he failed to perceive any very vast amount of harm
 27110	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up.
 27111	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA move had to be made because that merry old soul, the grasswidower
 27112	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin question who appeared to be glued to the spot, didn’t appear in any
 27113	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tparticular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly beloved Queenstown
 27114	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand it was highly likely some sponger’s bawdyhouse of retired beauties
 27115	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhere age was no bar off Sheriff street lower would be the best clue
 27116	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto that equivocal character’s whereabouts for a few days to come,

 27118	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trevolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to freeze
 27119	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe marrow of anybody’s bones and mauling their largesized charms

 27122	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the in reality was let x equal my right name and address, as Mr Algebra
 27123	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tremarks passim. At the same time he inwardly chuckled over his gentle
 27124	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trepartee to the blood and ouns champion about his god being a jew.
 27125	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tPeople could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what properly riled
 27126	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthem was a bite from a sheep. The most vulnerable point too of tender
 27127	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAchilles. Your god was a jew. Because mostly they appeared to imagine he
 27128	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcame from Carrick-on-Shannon or somewhereabouts in the county Sligo.
 27129	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 27130	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—I propose, our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while
 27131	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprudently pocketing her photo, as it’s rather stuffy here you just come
 27132	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thome with me and talk things over. My diggings are quite close in the
 27133	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvicinity. You can’t drink that stuff. Do you like cocoa? Wait. I’ll just
 27134	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpay this lot.

 27136	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe best plan clearly being to clear out, the remainder being plain
 27137	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsailing, he beckoned, while prudently pocketing the photo, to the keeper
 27138	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the shanty who didn’t seem to.
 27139	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 27140	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, that’s the best, he assured Stephen to whom for the matter of that
 27141	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBrazen Head or him or anywhere else was all more or less.
 27142	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 27143	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAll kinds of Utopian plans were flashing through his (B’s) busy brain,
 27144	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\teducation (the genuine article), literature, journalism, prize titbits,
 27145	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tup to date billing, concert tours in English watering resorts packed
 27146	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith hydros and seaside theatres, turning money away, duets in Italian
 27147	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith the accent perfectly true to nature and a quantity of other
 27148	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthings, no necessity, of course, to tell the world and his wife from the
 27149	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thousetops about it, and a slice of luck. An opening was all was wanted.
 27150	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBecause he more than suspected he had his father’s voice to bank his
 27151	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be just as
 27152	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twell, by the way no harm, to trail the conversation in the direction of

 27162	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 27163	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Give us a squint at that literature, grandfather, the ancient mariner
 27164	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tput in, manifesting some natural impatience.
 27165	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 27166	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—And welcome, answered the elderly party thus addressed.
 27167	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 27168	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles
 27169	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhich he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears.
 27170	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 27171	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Are you bad in the eyes? the sympathetic personage like the townclerk
 27172	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tqueried.
 27173	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 27174	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Why, answered the seafarer with the tartan beard, who seemingly was
 27175	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta bit of a literary cove in his own small way, staring out of seagreen
 27176	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tportholes as you might well describe them as, I uses goggles reading.
 27177	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSand in the Red Sea done that. One time I could read a book in the dark,
 27178	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmanner of speaking. The Arabian Nights Entertainment was my favourite
 27179	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand Red as a Rose is She.
 27180	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 27181	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon Lord only knows what,
 27182	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfound drowned or the exploits of King Willow, Iremonger having made a
 27183	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thundred and something second wicket not out for Notts, during which
 27184	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttime (completely regardless of Ire) the keeper was intensely occupied
 27185	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tloosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched
 27186	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thim as he muttered against whoever it was sold it, all of them who were
 27187	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions,
 27188	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat is to say, either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial
 27189	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tremark.
 27190	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 27191	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTo cut a long story short Bloom, grasping the situation, was the first
 27192	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first
 27193	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand foremost, being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for
 27194	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe occasion, taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine
 27195	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thost as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were
 27196	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnot looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming, making a
 27197	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgrand total of fourpence (the amount he deposited unobtrusively in
 27198	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfour coppers, literally the last of the Mohicans), he having previously
 27199	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him
 27200	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin unmistakable figures, coffee 2d, confectionery do, and honestly well
 27201	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tworth twice the money once in a way, as Wetherup used to remark.
 27202	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 27203	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Come, he counselled to close the séance.
 27204	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 27205	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSeeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the
 27206	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tshelter or shanty together and the élite society of oilskin and company
 27207	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their dolce far
 27208	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tniente. Stephen, who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged out,
 27209	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpaused at the, for a moment, the door.
 27210	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 27211	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—One thing I never understood, he said to be original on the spur of the
 27212	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmoment. Why they put tables upside down at night, I mean chairs upside
 27213	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdown, on the tables in cafés. To which impromptu the neverfailing Bloom
 27214	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\treplied without a moment’s hesitation, saying straight off:
 27215	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 27216	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—To sweep the floor in the morning.
 27217	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 27218	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSo saying he skipped around, nimbly considering, frankly at the same
 27219	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttime apologetic to get on his companion’s right, a habit of his, by the
 27220	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbye, his right side being, in classical idiom, his tender Achilles. The
 27221	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnight air was certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit
 27222	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tweak on his pins.
 27223	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 27224	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—It will (the air) do you good, Bloom said, meaning also the walk, in
 27225	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta moment. The only thing is to walk then you’ll feel a different man.
 27226	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCome. It’s not far. Lean on me.
 27227	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 27228	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAccordingly he passed his left arm in Stephen’s right and led him on
 27229	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\taccordingly.
 27230	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 27231	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Yes, Stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange kind
 27232	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof flesh of a different man approach him, sinewless and wobbly and all
 27233	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat.
 27234	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 27235	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAnyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier etc. where
 27236	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe municipal supernumerary, ex Gumley, was still to all intents and
 27237	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpurposes wrapped in the arms of Murphy, as the adage has it, dreaming
 27238	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof fresh fields and pastures new. And apropos of coffin of stones the
 27239	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanalogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the
 27240	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpart of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the
 27241	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttime of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class, probably the
 27242	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tselfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings.
 27243	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 27244	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSo they turned on to chatting about music, a form of art for which
 27245	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBloom, as a pure amateur, possessed the greatest love, as they made
 27246	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttracks arm in arm across Beresford place. Wagnerian music, though
 27247	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconfessedly grand in its way, was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard
 27248	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto follow at the first go-off but the music of Mercadante’s Huguenots,
 27249	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMeyerbeer’s Seven Last Words on the Cross and Mozart’s Twelfth Mass he
 27250	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsimply revelled in, the Gloria in that being, to his mind, the acme of
 27251	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfirst class music as such, literally knocking everything else into a
 27252	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcocked hat. He infinitely preferred the sacred music of the catholic
 27253	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchurch to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line such
 27254	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tas those Moody and Sankey hymns or Bid me to live and I will live thy
 27255	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprotestant to be. He also yielded to none in his admiration of Rossini’s
 27256	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStabat Mater, a work simply abounding in immortal numbers, in which his
 27257	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twife, Madam Marion Tweedy, made a hit, a veritable sensation, he might
 27258	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsafely say, greatly adding to her other laurels and putting the others
 27259	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttotally in the shade, in the jesuit fathers’ church in upper Gardiner
 27260	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstreet, the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with
 27261	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvirtuosos, or virtuosi rather. There was the unanimous opinion that
 27262	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthere was none to come up to her and suffice it to say in a place of
 27263	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tworship for music of a sacred character there was a generally voiced
 27264	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdesire for an encore. On the whole though favouring preferably light
 27265	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\topera of the Don Giovanni description and Martha, a gem in its line,
 27266	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the had a penchant, though with only a surface knowledge, for the severe
 27267	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tclassical school such as Mendelssohn. And talking of that, taking it
 27268	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor granted he knew all about the old favourites, he mentioned par
 27269	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\texcellence Lionel’s air in Martha, M’appari, which, curiously enough, he
 27270	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thad heard or overheard, to be more accurate, on yesterday, a privilege
 27271	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the keenly appreciated, from the lips of Stephen’s respected father, sung
 27272	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto perfection, a study of the number, in fact, which made all the others
 27273	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttake a back seat. Stephen, in reply to a politely put query, said he
 27274	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdidn’t sing it but launched out into praises of Shakespeare’s songs,
 27275	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tat least of in or about that period, the lutenist Dowland who lived
 27276	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin Fetter lane near Gerard the herbalist, who anno ludendo hausi,
 27277	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDoulandus, an instrument he was contemplating purchasing from Mr Arnold
 27278	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDolmetsch, whom B. did not quite recall though the name certainly
 27279	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsounded familiar, for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son with their
 27280	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdux and comes conceits and Byrd (William) who played the virginals,
 27281	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the said, in the Queen’s chapel or anywhere else he found them and one
 27282	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTomkins who made toys or airs and John Bull.
 27283	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 27284	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOn the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond
 27285	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe swingchains a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground,
 27286	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbrushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloom was not
 27287	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tperfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive
 27288	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tguineas and John Bull. He inquired if it was John Bull the political
 27289	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcelebrity of that ilk, as it struck him, the two identical names, as a
 27290	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstriking coincidence.
 27291	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 27292	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBy the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving, Bloom,
 27293	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twho was keeping a sharp lookout as usual, plucked the other’s sleeve
 27294	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgently, jocosely remarking:
 27295	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 27296	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—Our lives are in peril tonight. Beware of the steamroller.
 27297	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 27298	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThey thereupon stopped. Bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth
 27299	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanything like sixtyfive guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quite
 27300	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnear so that it seemed new, a different grouping of bones and even flesh
 27301	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbecause palpably it was a fourwalker, a hipshaker, a blackbuttocker, a
 27302	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttaildangler, a headhanger putting his hind foot foremost the while the
 27303	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlord of his creation sat on the perch, busy with his thoughts. But such
 27304	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta good poor brute he was sorry he hadn’t a lump of sugar but, as he
 27305	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twisely reflected, you could scarcely be prepared for every emergency
 27306	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthat might crop up. He was just a big nervous foolish noodly kind of a
 27307	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thorse, without a second care in the world. But even a dog, he reflected,
 27308	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttake that mongrel in Barney Kiernan’s, of the same size, would be a holy
 27309	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thorror to face. But it was no animal’s fault in particular if he was
 27310	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbuilt that way like the camel, ship of the desert, distilling grapes
 27311	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinto potheen in his hump. Nine tenths of them all could be caged or
 27312	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttrained, nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees. Whale with a
 27313	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tharpoon hairpin, alligator tickle the small of his back and he sees the
 27314	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tjoke, chalk a circle for a rooster, tiger my eagle eye. These timely
 27315	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\treflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind somewhat
 27316	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdistracted from Stephen’s words while the ship of the street was
 27317	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmanœuvring and Stephen went on about the highly interesting old.
 27318	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 27319	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t—What’s this I was saying? Ah, yes! My wife, he intimated, plunging
 27320	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin medias res, would have the greatest of pleasure in making your
 27321	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tacquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind.
 27322	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 27323	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen,
 27324	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\timage of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual handsome
 27325	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tblackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after as
 27326	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the was perhaps not that way built.
 27327	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 27328	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStill, supposing he had his father’s gift as he more than suspected,
 27329	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit opened up new vistas in his mind such as Lady Fingall’s Irish
 27330	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tindustries, concert on the preceding Monday, and aristocracy in general.
 27331	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 27332	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tExquisite variations he was now describing on an air Youth here has End
 27333	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby Jans Pieter Sweelinck, a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frows come
 27334	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom. Even more he liked an old German song of Johannes Jeep about
 27335	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe clear sea and the voices of sirens, sweet murderers of men, which
 27336	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tboggled Bloom a bit:
 27337	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 27338	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     Von der Sirenen Listigkeit
 27339	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t     Tun die Poeten dichten.
 27340	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 27341	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThese opening bars he sang and translated extempore. Bloom, nodding,
 27342	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsaid he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which
 27343	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\the did.
 27344	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 27345	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that, the rarest of boons,
 27346	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhich Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out, could easily,
 27347	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tif properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production
 27348	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuch as Barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain,
 27349	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcommand its own price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for
 27350	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tits fortunate possessor in the near future an entrée into fashionable
 27351	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thouses in the best residential quarters of financial magnates in a large
 27352	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tway of business and titled people where with his university degree of
 27353	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tB. A. (a huge ad in its way) and gentlemanly bearing to all the more
 27354	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinfluence the good impression he would infallibly score a distinct
 27355	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuccess, being blessed with brains which also could be utilised for the
 27356	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpurpose and other requisites, if his clothes were properly attended
 27357	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto so as to the better worm his way into their good graces as he, a
 27358	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tyouthful tyro in society’s sartorial niceties, hardly understood how a
 27359	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlittle thing like that could militate against you. It was in fact only a
 27360	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmatter of months and he could easily foresee him participating in
 27361	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir musical and artistic conversaziones during the festivities of the
 27362	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tChristmas season, for choice, causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes
 27363	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the fair sex and being made a lot of by ladies out for sensation,
 27364	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcases of which, as he happened to know, were on record—in fact, without
 27365	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgiving the show away, he himself once upon a time, if he cared to, could
 27366	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\teasily have. Added to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument
 27367	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tby no means to be sneezed at, going hand in hand with his tuition
 27368	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfees. Not, he parenthesised, that for the sake of filthy lucre he need
 27369	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnecessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy
 27370	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tspace of time. But a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or
 27371	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnay and both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his
 27372	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdignity in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to
 27373	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbe handed a cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped.
 27374	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBesides, though taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree, original
 27375	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmusic like that, different from the conventional rut, would rapidly
 27376	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thave a great vogue as it would be a decided novelty for Dublin’s musical
 27377	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tworld after the usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a
 27378	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconfiding public by Ivan St Austell and Hilton St Just and their genus
 27379	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tomne. Yes, beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his
 27380	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thand and he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a
 27381	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thigh place in the city’s esteem where he could command a stiff figure
 27382	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand, booking ahead, give a grand concert for the patrons of the King
 27383	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tstreet house, given a backerup, if one were forthcoming to kick him
 27384	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tupstairs, so to speak, a big if, however, with some impetus of the
 27385	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgoahead sort to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often
 27386	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttripped up a too much fêted prince of good fellows. And it need not
 27387	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdetract from the other by one iota as, being his own master, he would
 27388	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thave heaps of time to practise literature in his spare moments when
 27389	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdesirous of so doing without its clashing with his vocal career or
 27390	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcontaining anything derogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself
 27391	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\talone. In fact, he had the ball at his feet and that was the very reason
 27392	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhy the other, possessed of a remarkably sharp nose for smelling a rat
 27393	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof any sort, hung on to him at all.
 27394	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 27395	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe horse was just then. And later on at a propitious opportunity he
 27396	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpurposed (Bloom did), without anyway prying into his private affairs
 27397	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton the fools step in where angels principle, advising him to sever his
 27398	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconnection with a certain budding practitioner who, he noticed, was
 27399	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious
 27400	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpretext when not present, deprecate him, or whatever you like to call it
 27401	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhich in Bloom’s humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of
 27402	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta person’s character, no pun intended.
 27403	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 27404	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe horse having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted and,
 27405	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting fall on
 27406	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three smoking
 27407	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglobes of turds. Slowly three times, one after another, from a full
 27408	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcrupper he mired. And humanely his driver waited till he (or she) had
 27409	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tended, patient in his scythed car.
 27410	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 27411	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSide by side Bloom, profiting by the contretemps, with Stephen passed
 27412	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthrough the gap of the chains, divided by the upright, and, stepping
 27413	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tover a strand of mire, went across towards Gardiner street lower,
 27414	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStephen singing more boldly, but not loudly, the end of the ballad.
 27415	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 27416	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t      Und alle Schiffe brücken.
 27417	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 27418	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe driver never said a word, good, bad or indifferent, but merely
 27419	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twatched the two figures, as he sat on his lowbacked car, both black, one

 27443	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tright, Temple street, north, as far as Hardwicke place. Approaching,

 27447	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 27448	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tOf what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary?
 27449	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t

 27451	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tprostitution, diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and
 27452	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tglowlamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees, exposed
 27453	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcorporation emergency dustbuckets, the Roman catholic church,

 27460	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 27461	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBoth were sensitive to artistic impressions, musical in preference to
 27462	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplastic or pictorial. Both preferred a continental to an insular manner
 27463	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof life, a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence. Both
 27464	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tindurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of
 27465	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\theterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox
 27466	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\treligious, national, social and ethical doctrines. Both admitted
 27467	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual

 27474	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature. Bloom
 27475	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tassented covertly to Stephen’s rectification of the anachronism
 27476	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinvolved in assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to
 27477	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tchristianity from druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus,
 27478	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tson of Odyssus, sent by pope Celestine I in the year 432 in the reign

 27480	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t266 A.D.), suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty
 27481	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand interred at Rossnaree. The collapse which Bloom ascribed to
 27482	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of
 27483	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tadulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and
 27484	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, Stephen
 27485	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tattributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both
 27486	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom two different points of observation Sandycove and Dublin) at first

 27505	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and separately on the

 27511	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t1886, 1888, 1892, 1893, 1904 did Bloom make before their arrival at
 27512	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir destination?
 27513	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 27514	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual

 27548	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tarea railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at
 27549	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its
 27550	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlength of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches
 27551	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in space by

 28016	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttheir ages initially in the ratio of 16 to 0 would be as 17 1/2 to 13
 28017	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t1/2, the proportion increasing and the disparity diminishing according

 28044	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 28045	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDid Bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son and

 28053	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 28054	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMrs Riordan (Dante), a widow of independent means, had resided in the
 28055	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thouse of Stephen’s parents from 1 September 1888 to 29 December 1891 and

 28064	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 28065	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings, an infirm widow
 28066	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof independent, if limited, means, in her convalescent bathchair
 28067	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twith slow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the North

 28074	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 28075	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhy could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity?
 28076	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 28077	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBecause in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel

 28086	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe older, her bezique cards and counters, her Skye terrier, her
 28087	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsuppositious wealth, her lapses of responsiveness and incipient
 28088	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcatarrhal deafness: the younger, her lamp of colza oil before the statue
 28089	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof the Immaculate Conception, her green and maroon brushes for Charles
 28090	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tStewart Parnell and for Michael Davitt, her tissue papers.
 28091	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 28092	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWere there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation

 28103	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 28104	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHad any special agility been his in earlier youth?
 28105	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t

 28155	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 28156	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBecause of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation

 28549	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 28550	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhy was the host (victim predestined) sad?
 28551	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t

 28558	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t

 28560	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 28561	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tHe weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder: the
 28562	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tincitations of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, the
 28563	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpropagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity, the envy of
 28564	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\topulence, the influence of retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of
 28565	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tatavistic delinquency, the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism,
 28566	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thypnotic suggestion and somnambulism.
 28567	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 28568	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFrom which (if any) of these mental or physical disorders was he not
 28569	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttotally immune?

 28571	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFrom hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his
 28572	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsleeping apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an
 28573	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tindefinite time incapable of moving or uttering sounds. From
 28574	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsomnambulism: once, sleeping, his body had risen, crouched and
 28575	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcrawled in the direction of a heatless fire and, having attained
 28576	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tits destination, there, curled, unheated, in night attire had lain,

 28583	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t(Milly) at the ages of 6 and 8 years had uttered in sleep an exclamation
 28584	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof terror and had replied to the interrogations of two figures in night

 28597	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhat endemic characteristics were present?
 28598	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 28599	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tConversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct

 28602	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 28603	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhat memories had he of her adolescence?
 28604	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 28605	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe relegated her hoop and skippingrope to a recess. On the duke’s lawn,
 28606	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tentreated by an English visitor, she declined to permit him to make and
 28607	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttake away her photographic image (objection not stated). On the South
 28608	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tCircular road in the company of Elsa Potter, followed by an individual
 28609	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof sinister aspect, she went half way down Stamer street and turned
 28610	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tabruptly back (reason of change not stated). On the vigil of the 15th
 28611	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanniversary of her birth she wrote a letter from Mullingar, county
 28612	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWestmeath, making a brief allusion to a local student (faculty and year
 28613	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tnot stated).
 28614	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 28615	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDid that first division, portending a second division, afflict him?
 28616	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 28617	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tLess than he had imagined, more than he had hoped.
 28618	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 28619	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhat second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly,

 28622	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tA temporary departure of his cat.
 28623	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 28624	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhy similarly, why differently?
 28625	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 28626	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tSimilarly, because actuated by a secret purpose the quest of a new
 28627	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmale (Mullingar student) or of a healing herb (valerian). Differently,
 28628	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbecause of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the
 28629	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thabitation.
 28630	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 28631	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIn other respects were their differences similar?
 28632	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 28633	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIn passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in
 28634	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tunexpectedness.
 28635	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 28636	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAs?
 28637	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 28638	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tInasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it
 28639	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfor her (cf neckarching cat). Moreover, on the free surface of the lake

 28642	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tconstancy of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish (cf
 28643	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmousewatching cat). Again, in order to remember the date, combatants,
 28644	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tissue and consequences of a famous military engagement she pulled a
 28645	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tplait of her hair (cf earwashing cat). Furthermore, silly Milly, she
 28646	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdreamed of having had an unspoken unremembered conversation with a horse
 28647	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\twhose name had been Joseph to whom (which) she had offered a
 28648	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttumblerful of lemonade which it (he) had appeared to have accepted (cf
 28649	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thearthdreaming cat). Hence, in passivity, in economy, in the instinct of
 28650	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ttradition, in unexpectedness, their differences were similar.
 28651	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 28652	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIn what way had he utilised gifts (1) an owl, 2) a clock, given as
 28653	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmatrimonial auguries, to interest and to instruct her?
 28654	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 28655	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tAs object lessons to explain: 1) the nature and habits of oviparous
 28656	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tanimals, the possibility of aerial flight, certain abnormalities of
 28657	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvision, the secular process of imbalsamation: 2) the principle of the
 28658	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpendulum, exemplified in bob, wheelgear and regulator, the translation
 28659	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tin terms of human or social regulation of the various positions of
 28660	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tclockwise moveable indicators on an unmoving dial, the exactitude of the
 28661	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\trecurrence per hour of an instant in each hour when the longer and the

 28664	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 28665	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIn what manners did she reciprocate?

 28667	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tShe remembered: on the 27th anniversary of his birth she presented to

 28673	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto possess without gradual acquisition a fraction of his science, the

 28675	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 28676	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhat proposal did Bloom, diambulist, father of Milly, somnambulist, make
 28677	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tto Stephen, noctambulist?
 28678	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 28679	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tTo pass in repose the hours intervening between Thursday (proper) and
 28680	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFriday (normal) on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately

 28684	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhat various advantages would or might have resulted from a prolongation
 28685	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tof such an extemporisation?
 28686	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 28687	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tFor the guest: security of domicile and seclusion of study. For the
 28688	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thost: rejuvenation of intelligence, vicarious satisfaction. For the
 28689	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\thostess: disintegration of obsession, acquisition of correct Italian
 28690	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpronunciation.
 28691	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 28692	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhy might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and

 28696	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 28697	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBecause the way to daughter led through mother, the way to mother

 28718	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t

 28746	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tpublicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he (Bloom) was his
 28747	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t(the clown’s) papa. The imprevidibility of the future: once in the
 28748	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tsummer of 1898 he (Bloom) had marked a florin (2/-) with three notches
 28749	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ton the milled edge and tendered it in payment of an account due to and

 28760	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tNever.
 28761	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 28762	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhy would a recurrent frustration the more depress him?
 28763	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 28764	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBecause at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to
 28765	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tamend many social conditions, the product of inequality and avarice and
 28766	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tinternational animosity.
 28767	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t

 28770	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 28771	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThere remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as distinct
 28772	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfrom human law, as integral parts of the human whole: the necessity of
 28773	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdestruction to procure alimentary sustenance: the painful character of
 28774	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe ultimate functions of separate existence, the agonies of birth and
 28775	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tdeath: the monotonous menstruation of simian and (particularly) human
 28776	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfemales extending from the age of puberty to the menopause: inevitable
 28777	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\taccidents at sea, in mines and factories: certain very painful maladies
 28778	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tand their resultant surgical operations, innate lunacy and congenital
 28779	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcriminality, decimating epidemics: catastrophic cataclysms which make

 28784	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 28785	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhy did he desist from speculation?
 28786	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 28787	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBecause it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other
 28788	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmore acceptable phenomena in the place of the less acceptable phenomena

 28790	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t

 28801	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 28802	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhat comforted his misapprehension?
 28803	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 28804	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThat as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from

 29124	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tMore active air, a matutinal distant cock, ecclesiastical clocks at
 29125	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tvarious points, avine music, the isolated tread of an early wayfarer,
 29126	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe visible diffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body, the
 29127	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfirst golden limb of the resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon.
 29128	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 29129	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tDid he remain?
 29130	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 29131	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWith deep inspiration he returned, retraversing the garden, reentering
 29132	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tthe passage, reclosing the door. With brief suspiration he reassumed the

 29136	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhat suddenly arrested his ingress?
 29137	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 29138	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tThe right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into
 29139	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcontact with a solid timber angle where, an infinitesimal but sensible

 29168	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhat significances attached to these two chairs?
 29169	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t

 29188	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\ta large dull passive and a slender bright active: with solicitation,
 29189	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tbending and downturning the upturned rugfringe: with amusement,
 29190	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tremembering Dr Malachi Mulligan’s scheme of colour containing the
 29191	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tgradation of green: with pleasure, repeating the words and antecedent

 29201	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tmantelpiece, produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus
 29202	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t(illustrated) entitled Agendath Netaim, unfolded the same, examined
 29203	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tit superficially, rolled it into a thin cylinder, ignited it in the
 29204	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tcandleflame, applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the
 29205	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tlatter reached the stage of rutilance, placed the cylinder in the basin

 29207	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tfacilitate total combustion.
 29208	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 29209	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhat followed this operation?

 29226	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tIn the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the

 29232	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 29233	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tWhat composite asymmetrical image in the mirror then attracted his

 30293	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tJealousy?
 30294	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\t
 30295	UlyssesbyJamesJoyce.txt\tBecause a nature full and volatile in its free state, was alternately
