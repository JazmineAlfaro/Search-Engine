    66	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t        That keep the Jungle Law!
    67	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     Night-Song in the Jungle
    68	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
    69	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tIt was seven o’clock of a very warm evening in the Seeonee hills when
    70	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tFather Wolf woke up from his day’s rest, scratched himself, yawned, and
    71	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tspread out his paws one after the other to get rid of the sleepy feeling
    72	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tin their tips. Mother Wolf lay with her big gray nose dropped across her
    73	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfour tumbling, squealing cubs, and the moon shone into the mouth of the
    74	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcave where they all lived. “Augrh!” said Father Wolf. “It is time to
    75	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thunt again.” He was going to spring down hill when a little shadow with
    76	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ta bushy tail crossed the threshold and whined: “Good luck go with you, O
    77	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tChief of the Wolves. And good luck and strong white teeth go with noble
    78	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tchildren that they may never forget the hungry in this world.”
    79	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
    80	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tIt was the jackal--Tabaqui, the Dish-licker--and the wolves of India
    81	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdespise Tabaqui because he runs about making mischief, and telling
    82	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttales, and eating rags and pieces of leather from the village
    83	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\trubbish-heaps. But they are afraid of him too, because Tabaqui, more
    84	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthan anyone else in the jungle, is apt to go mad, and then he forgets
    85	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthat he was ever afraid of anyone, and runs through the forest biting
    86	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\teverything in his way. Even the tiger runs and hides when little Tabaqui
    87	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgoes mad, for madness is the most disgraceful thing that can overtake
    88	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ta wild creature. We call it hydrophobia, but they call it dewanee--the
    89	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmadness--and run.
    90	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
    91	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Enter, then, and look,” said Father Wolf stiffly, “but there is no food
    92	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\there.”
    93	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
    94	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“For a wolf, no,” said Tabaqui, “but for so mean a person as myself a
    95	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdry bone is a good feast. Who are we, the Gidur-log [the jackal people],
    96	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto pick and choose?” He scuttled to the back of the cave, where he
    97	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfound the bone of a buck with some meat on it, and sat cracking the end
    98	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmerrily.
    99	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   100	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“All thanks for this good meal,” he said, licking his lips. “How
   101	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbeautiful are the noble children! How large are their eyes! And so young
   102	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttoo! Indeed, indeed, I might have remembered that the children of kings
   103	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tare men from the beginning.”
   104	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   105	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tNow, Tabaqui knew as well as anyone else that there is nothing so
   106	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tunlucky as to compliment children to their faces. It pleased him to see
   107	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMother and Father Wolf look uncomfortable.
   108	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   109	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tTabaqui sat still, rejoicing in the mischief that he had made, and then
   110	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\the said spitefully:
   111	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   112	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Shere Khan, the Big One, has shifted his hunting grounds. He will hunt
   113	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tamong these hills for the next moon, so he has told me.”
   114	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   115	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tShere Khan was the tiger who lived near the Waingunga River, twenty
   116	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmiles away.
   117	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   118	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“He has no right!” Father Wolf began angrily--“By the Law of the Jungle
   119	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\the has no right to change his quarters without due warning. He will
   120	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfrighten every head of game within ten miles, and I--I have to kill for
   121	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttwo, these days.”
   122	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   123	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“His mother did not call him Lungri [the Lame One] for nothing,” said
   124	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMother Wolf quietly. “He has been lame in one foot from his birth. That
   125	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tis why he has only killed cattle. Now the villagers of the Waingunga are
   126	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tangry with him, and he has come here to make our villagers angry.
   127	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThey will scour the jungle for him when he is far away, and we and our
   128	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tchildren must run when the grass is set alight. Indeed, we are very
   129	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgrateful to Shere Khan!”
   130	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   131	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Shall I tell him of your gratitude?” said Tabaqui.
   132	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   133	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Out!” snapped Father Wolf. “Out and hunt with thy master. Thou hast
   134	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdone harm enough for one night.”
   135	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   136	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I go,” said Tabaqui quietly. “Ye can hear Shere Khan below in the
   137	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthickets. I might have saved myself the message.”
   138	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   139	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tFather Wolf listened, and below in the valley that ran down to a little
   140	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\triver he heard the dry, angry, snarly, singsong whine of a tiger who has
   141	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcaught nothing and does not care if all the jungle knows it.
   142	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   143	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“The fool!” said Father Wolf. “To begin a night’s work with that noise!
   144	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tDoes he think that our buck are like his fat Waingunga bullocks?”
   145	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   146	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“H’sh. It is neither bullock nor buck he hunts to-night,” said Mother
   147	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tWolf. “It is Man.”
   148	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   149	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe whine had changed to a sort of humming purr that seemed to come
   150	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfrom every quarter of the compass. It was the noise that bewilders
   151	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twoodcutters and gypsies sleeping in the open, and makes them run
   152	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsometimes into the very mouth of the tiger.
   153	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   154	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Man!” said Father Wolf, showing all his white teeth. “Faugh! Are there
   155	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnot enough beetles and frogs in the tanks that he must eat Man, and on
   156	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tour ground too!”
   157	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   158	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe Law of the Jungle, which never orders anything without a reason,
   159	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tforbids every beast to eat Man except when he is killing to show his
   160	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tchildren how to kill, and then he must hunt outside the hunting grounds
   161	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof his pack or tribe. The real reason for this is that man-killing
   162	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmeans, sooner or later, the arrival of white men on elephants, with
   163	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tguns, and hundreds of brown men with gongs and rockets and torches.
   164	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThen everybody in the jungle suffers. The reason the beasts give among
   165	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthemselves is that Man is the weakest and most defenseless of all living
   166	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthings, and it is unsportsmanlike to touch him. They say too--and it is
   167	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttrue--that man-eaters become mangy, and lose their teeth.
   168	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   169	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe purr grew louder, and ended in the full-throated “Aaarh!” of the
   170	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttiger’s charge.
   171	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   172	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThen there was a howl--an untigerish howl--from Shere Khan. “He has
   173	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmissed,” said Mother Wolf. “What is it?”
   174	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   175	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tFather Wolf ran out a few paces and heard Shere Khan muttering and
   176	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmumbling savagely as he tumbled about in the scrub.
   177	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   178	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“The fool has had no more sense than to jump at a woodcutter’s campfire,
   179	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand has burned his feet,” said Father Wolf with a grunt. “Tabaqui is
   180	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twith him.”
   181	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   182	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Something is coming uphill,” said Mother Wolf, twitching one ear. “Get
   183	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tready.”
   184	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   185	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe bushes rustled a little in the thicket, and Father Wolf dropped
   186	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twith his haunches under him, ready for his leap. Then, if you had been
   187	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twatching, you would have seen the most wonderful thing in the world--the
   188	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twolf checked in mid-spring. He made his bound before he saw what it was
   189	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\the was jumping at, and then he tried to stop himself. The result was
   190	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthat he shot up straight into the air for four or five feet, landing
   191	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\talmost where he left ground.
   192	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   193	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Man!” he snapped. “A man’s cub. Look!”
   194	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   195	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tDirectly in front of him, holding on by a low branch, stood a naked
   196	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbrown baby who could just walk--as soft and as dimpled a little atom
   197	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tas ever came to a wolf’s cave at night. He looked up into Father Wolf’s
   198	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tface, and laughed.
   199	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   200	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Is that a man’s cub?” said Mother Wolf. “I have never seen one. Bring
   201	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tit here.”
   202	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   203	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tA Wolf accustomed to moving his own cubs can, if necessary, mouth an egg
   204	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twithout breaking it, and though Father Wolf’s jaws closed right on the
   205	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tchild’s back not a tooth even scratched the skin as he laid it down
   206	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tamong the cubs.
   207	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   208	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“How little! How naked, and--how bold!” said Mother Wolf softly. The
   209	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbaby was pushing his way between the cubs to get close to the warm hide.
   210	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Ahai! He is taking his meal with the others. And so this is a man’s
   211	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcub. Now, was there ever a wolf that could boast of a man’s cub among
   212	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ther children?”
   213	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   214	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I have heard now and again of such a thing, but never in our Pack or in
   215	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmy time,” said Father Wolf. “He is altogether without hair, and I
   216	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcould kill him with a touch of my foot. But see, he looks up and is not
   217	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tafraid.”
   218	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   219	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe moonlight was blocked out of the mouth of the cave, for Shere Khan’s
   220	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgreat square head and shoulders were thrust into the entrance. Tabaqui,
   221	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbehind him, was squeaking: “My lord, my lord, it went in here!”
   222	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   223	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Shere Khan does us great honor,” said Father Wolf, but his eyes were
   224	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tvery angry. “What does Shere Khan need?”
   225	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   226	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“My quarry. A man’s cub went this way,” said Shere Khan. “Its parents
   227	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thave run off. Give it to me.”
   228	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   229	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tShere Khan had jumped at a woodcutter’s campfire, as Father Wolf had
   230	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsaid, and was furious from the pain of his burned feet. But Father Wolf
   231	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tknew that the mouth of the cave was too narrow for a tiger to come in
   232	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tby. Even where he was, Shere Khan’s shoulders and forepaws were cramped
   233	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfor want of room, as a man’s would be if he tried to fight in a barrel.
   234	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   235	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“The Wolves are a free people,” said Father Wolf. “They take orders from
   236	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe Head of the Pack, and not from any striped cattle-killer. The man’s
   237	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcub is ours--to kill if we choose.”
   238	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   239	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Ye choose and ye do not choose! What talk is this of choosing? By the
   240	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbull that I killed, am I to stand nosing into your dog’s den for my fair
   241	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdues? It is I, Shere Khan, who speak!”
   242	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   243	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe tiger’s roar filled the cave with thunder. Mother Wolf shook herself
   244	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tclear of the cubs and sprang forward, her eyes, like two green moons in
   245	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe darkness, facing the blazing eyes of Shere Khan.
   246	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   247	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“And it is I, Raksha [The Demon], who answers. The man’s cub is mine,
   248	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tLungri--mine to me! He shall not be killed. He shall live to run with
   249	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe Pack and to hunt with the Pack; and in the end, look you, hunter of
   250	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlittle naked cubs--frog-eater--fish-killer--he shall hunt thee! Now get
   251	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thence, or by the Sambhur that I killed (I eat no starved cattle), back
   252	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthou goest to thy mother, burned beast of the jungle, lamer than ever
   253	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthou camest into the world! Go!”
   254	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   255	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tFather Wolf looked on amazed. He had almost forgotten the days when he
   256	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twon Mother Wolf in fair fight from five other wolves, when she ran in
   257	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe Pack and was not called The Demon for compliment’s sake. Shere Khan
   258	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmight have faced Father Wolf, but he could not stand up against Mother
   259	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tWolf, for he knew that where he was she had all the advantage of the
   260	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tground, and would fight to the death. So he backed out of the cave mouth
   261	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgrowling, and when he was clear he shouted:
   262	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   263	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Each dog barks in his own yard! We will see what the Pack will say to
   264	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthis fostering of man-cubs. The cub is mine, and to my teeth he will
   265	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcome in the end, O bush-tailed thieves!”
   266	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   267	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMother Wolf threw herself down panting among the cubs, and Father Wolf
   268	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsaid to her gravely:
   269	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   270	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Shere Khan speaks this much truth. The cub must be shown to the Pack.
   271	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tWilt thou still keep him, Mother?”
   272	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   273	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Keep him!” she gasped. “He came naked, by night, alone and very hungry;
   274	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tyet he was not afraid! Look, he has pushed one of my babes to one side
   275	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\talready. And that lame butcher would have killed him and would have run
   276	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\toff to the Waingunga while the villagers here hunted through all our
   277	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlairs in revenge! Keep him? Assuredly I will keep him. Lie still, little
   278	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfrog. O thou Mowgli--for Mowgli the Frog I will call thee--the time will
   279	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcome when thou wilt hunt Shere Khan as he has hunted thee.”
   280	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   281	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“But what will our Pack say?” said Father Wolf.
   282	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   283	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe Law of the Jungle lays down very clearly that any wolf may, when he
   284	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmarries, withdraw from the Pack he belongs to. But as soon as his cubs
   285	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tare old enough to stand on their feet he must bring them to the Pack
   286	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tCouncil, which is generally held once a month at full moon, in order
   287	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthat the other wolves may identify them. After that inspection the cubs
   288	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tare free to run where they please, and until they have killed their
   289	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfirst buck no excuse is accepted if a grown wolf of the Pack kills one
   290	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof them. The punishment is death where the murderer can be found; and if
   291	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tyou think for a minute you will see that this must be so.
   292	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   293	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tFather Wolf waited till his cubs could run a little, and then on the
   294	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnight of the Pack Meeting took them and Mowgli and Mother Wolf to the
   295	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tCouncil Rock--a hilltop covered with stones and boulders where a hundred
   296	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twolves could hide. Akela, the great gray Lone Wolf, who led all the Pack
   297	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tby strength and cunning, lay out at full length on his rock, and
   298	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbelow him sat forty or more wolves of every size and color, from
   299	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbadger-colored veterans who could handle a buck alone to young black
   300	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthree-year-olds who thought they could. The Lone Wolf had led them for a
   301	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tyear now. He had fallen twice into a wolf trap in his youth, and once he
   302	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thad been beaten and left for dead; so he knew the manners and customs
   303	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof men. There was very little talking at the Rock. The cubs tumbled over
   304	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\teach other in the center of the circle where their mothers and fathers
   305	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsat, and now and again a senior wolf would go quietly up to a cub, look
   306	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tat him carefully, and return to his place on noiseless feet. Sometimes a
   307	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmother would push her cub far out into the moonlight to be sure that
   308	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\the had not been overlooked. Akela from his rock would cry: “Ye know
   309	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe Law--ye know the Law. Look well, O Wolves!” And the anxious mothers
   310	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twould take up the call: “Look--look well, O Wolves!”
   311	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   312	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tAt last--and Mother Wolf’s neck bristles lifted as the time came--Father
   313	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tWolf pushed “Mowgli the Frog,” as they called him, into the center,
   314	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twhere he sat laughing and playing with some pebbles that glistened in
   315	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe moonlight.
   316	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   317	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tAkela never raised his head from his paws, but went on with the
   318	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmonotonous cry: “Look well!” A muffled roar came up from behind the
   319	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\trocks--the voice of Shere Khan crying: “The cub is mine. Give him to
   320	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tme. What have the Free People to do with a man’s cub?” Akela never even
   321	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttwitched his ears. All he said was: “Look well, O Wolves! What have
   322	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe Free People to do with the orders of any save the Free People? Look
   323	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twell!”
   324	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   325	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThere was a chorus of deep growls, and a young wolf in his fourth year
   326	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tflung back Shere Khan’s question to Akela: “What have the Free People to
   327	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdo with a man’s cub?” Now, the Law of the Jungle lays down that if there
   328	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tis any dispute as to the right of a cub to be accepted by the Pack, he
   329	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmust be spoken for by at least two members of the Pack who are not his
   330	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfather and mother.
   331	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   332	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Who speaks for this cub?” said Akela. “Among the Free People who
   333	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tspeaks?” There was no answer and Mother Wolf got ready for what she knew
   334	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twould be her last fight, if things came to fighting.
   335	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   336	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThen the only other creature who is allowed at the Pack Council--Baloo,
   337	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe sleepy brown bear who teaches the wolf cubs the Law of the Jungle:
   338	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\told Baloo, who can come and go where he pleases because he eats only
   339	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnuts and roots and honey--rose upon his hind quarters and grunted.
   340	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   341	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“The man’s cub--the man’s cub?” he said. “I speak for the man’s cub.
   342	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThere is no harm in a man’s cub. I have no gift of words, but I speak
   343	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe truth. Let him run with the Pack, and be entered with the others. I
   344	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmyself will teach him.”
   345	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   346	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“We need yet another,” said Akela. “Baloo has spoken, and he is our
   347	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tteacher for the young cubs. Who speaks besides Baloo?”
   348	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   349	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tA black shadow dropped down into the circle. It was Bagheera the Black
   350	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tPanther, inky black all over, but with the panther markings showing
   351	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tup in certain lights like the pattern of watered silk. Everybody knew
   352	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBagheera, and nobody cared to cross his path; for he was as cunning as
   353	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tTabaqui, as bold as the wild buffalo, and as reckless as the wounded
   354	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\telephant. But he had a voice as soft as wild honey dripping from a tree,
   355	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand a skin softer than down.
   356	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   357	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“O Akela, and ye the Free People,” he purred, “I have no right in your
   358	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tassembly, but the Law of the Jungle says that if there is a doubt which
   359	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tis not a killing matter in regard to a new cub, the life of that cub may
   360	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbe bought at a price. And the Law does not say who may or may not pay
   361	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthat price. Am I right?”
   362	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   363	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Good! Good!” said the young wolves, who are always hungry. “Listen to
   364	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBagheera. The cub can be bought for a price. It is the Law.”
   365	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   366	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Knowing that I have no right to speak here, I ask your leave.”
   367	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   368	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Speak then,” cried twenty voices.
   369	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   370	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“To kill a naked cub is shame. Besides, he may make better sport for you
   371	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twhen he is grown. Baloo has spoken in his behalf. Now to Baloo’s word
   372	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tI will add one bull, and a fat one, newly killed, not half a mile
   373	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfrom here, if ye will accept the man’s cub according to the Law. Is it
   374	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdifficult?”
   375	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   376	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThere was a clamor of scores of voices, saying: “What matter? He will
   377	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdie in the winter rains. He will scorch in the sun. What harm can
   378	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ta naked frog do us? Let him run with the Pack. Where is the bull,
   379	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBagheera? Let him be accepted.” And then came Akela’s deep bay, crying:
   380	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Look well--look well, O Wolves!”
   381	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   382	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMowgli was still deeply interested in the pebbles, and he did not notice
   383	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twhen the wolves came and looked at him one by one. At last they all went
   384	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdown the hill for the dead bull, and only Akela, Bagheera, Baloo, and
   385	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMowgli’s own wolves were left. Shere Khan roared still in the night, for
   386	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\the was very angry that Mowgli had not been handed over to him.
   387	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   388	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Ay, roar well,” said Bagheera, under his whiskers, “for the time will
   389	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcome when this naked thing will make thee roar to another tune, or I
   390	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tknow nothing of man.”
   391	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   392	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“It was well done,” said Akela. “Men and their cubs are very wise. He
   393	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmay be a help in time.”
   394	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   395	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Truly, a help in time of need; for none can hope to lead the Pack
   396	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tforever,” said Bagheera.
   397	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   398	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tAkela said nothing. He was thinking of the time that comes to every
   399	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tleader of every pack when his strength goes from him and he gets feebler
   400	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand feebler, till at last he is killed by the wolves and a new leader
   401	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcomes up--to be killed in his turn.
   402	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   403	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Take him away,” he said to Father Wolf, “and train him as befits one of
   404	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe Free People.”
   405	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   406	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tAnd that is how Mowgli was entered into the Seeonee Wolf Pack for the
   407	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tprice of a bull and on Baloo’s good word.
   408	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   409	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tNow you must be content to skip ten or eleven whole years, and only
   410	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tguess at all the wonderful life that Mowgli led among the wolves,
   411	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbecause if it were written out it would fill ever so many books. He
   412	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgrew up with the cubs, though they, of course, were grown wolves almost
   413	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbefore he was a child. And Father Wolf taught him his business, and the
   414	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmeaning of things in the jungle, till every rustle in the grass, every
   415	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbreath of the warm night air, every note of the owls above his head,
   416	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tevery scratch of a bat’s claws as it roosted for a while in a tree, and
   417	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tevery splash of every little fish jumping in a pool meant just as much
   418	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto him as the work of his office means to a business man. When he was
   419	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnot learning he sat out in the sun and slept, and ate and went to sleep
   420	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tagain. When he felt dirty or hot he swam in the forest pools; and
   421	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twhen he wanted honey (Baloo told him that honey and nuts were just as
   422	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tpleasant to eat as raw meat) he climbed up for it, and that Bagheera
   423	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tshowed him how to do. Bagheera would lie out on a branch and call, “Come
   424	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\talong, Little Brother,” and at first Mowgli would cling like the sloth,
   425	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbut afterward he would fling himself through the branches almost as
   426	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tboldly as the gray ape. He took his place at the Council Rock, too,
   427	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twhen the Pack met, and there he discovered that if he stared hard at any
   428	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twolf, the wolf would be forced to drop his eyes, and so he used to stare
   429	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfor fun. At other times he would pick the long thorns out of the pads
   430	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof his friends, for wolves suffer terribly from thorns and burs in their
   431	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcoats. He would go down the hillside into the cultivated lands by night,
   432	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand look very curiously at the villagers in their huts, but he had a
   433	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmistrust of men because Bagheera showed him a square box with a drop
   434	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgate so cunningly hidden in the jungle that he nearly walked into it,
   435	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand told him that it was a trap. He loved better than anything else to
   436	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgo with Bagheera into the dark warm heart of the forest, to sleep all
   437	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthrough the drowsy day, and at night see how Bagheera did his
   438	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tkilling. Bagheera killed right and left as he felt hungry, and so did
   439	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMowgli--with one exception. As soon as he was old enough to understand
   440	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthings, Bagheera told him that he must never touch cattle because he had
   441	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbeen bought into the Pack at the price of a bull’s life. “All the jungle
   442	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tis thine,” said Bagheera, “and thou canst kill everything that thou art
   443	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tstrong enough to kill; but for the sake of the bull that bought thee
   444	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthou must never kill or eat any cattle young or old. That is the Law of
   445	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe Jungle.” Mowgli obeyed faithfully.
   446	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   447	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tAnd he grew and grew strong as a boy must grow who does not know that
   448	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\the is learning any lessons, and who has nothing in the world to think of
   449	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\texcept things to eat.
   450	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   451	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMother Wolf told him once or twice that Shere Khan was not a creature
   452	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto be trusted, and that some day he must kill Shere Khan. But though a
   453	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tyoung wolf would have remembered that advice every hour, Mowgli forgot
   454	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tit because he was only a boy--though he would have called himself a wolf
   455	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tif he had been able to speak in any human tongue.
   456	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   457	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tShere Khan was always crossing his path in the jungle, for as Akela grew
   458	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tolder and feebler the lame tiger had come to be great friends with the
   459	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tyounger wolves of the Pack, who followed him for scraps, a thing Akela
   460	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twould never have allowed if he had dared to push his authority to the
   461	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tproper bounds. Then Shere Khan would flatter them and wonder that such
   462	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfine young hunters were content to be led by a dying wolf and a man’s
   463	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcub. “They tell me,” Shere Khan would say, “that at Council ye dare
   464	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnot look him between the eyes.” And the young wolves would growl and
   465	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbristle.
   466	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   467	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBagheera, who had eyes and ears everywhere, knew something of this, and
   468	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tonce or twice he told Mowgli in so many words that Shere Khan would kill
   469	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thim some day. Mowgli would laugh and answer: “I have the Pack and I have
   470	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthee; and Baloo, though he is so lazy, might strike a blow or two for my
   471	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsake. Why should I be afraid?”
   472	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   473	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tIt was one very warm day that a new notion came to Bagheera--born of
   474	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsomething that he had heard. Perhaps Ikki the Porcupine had told him;
   475	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbut he said to Mowgli when they were deep in the jungle, as the boy lay
   476	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twith his head on Bagheera’s beautiful black skin, “Little Brother, how
   477	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\toften have I told thee that Shere Khan is thy enemy?”
   478	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   479	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“As many times as there are nuts on that palm,” said Mowgli, who,
   480	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnaturally, could not count. “What of it? I am sleepy, Bagheera, and
   481	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tShere Khan is all long tail and loud talk--like Mao, the Peacock.”
   482	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   483	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“But this is no time for sleeping. Baloo knows it; I know it; the Pack
   484	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tknow it; and even the foolish, foolish deer know. Tabaqui has told thee
   485	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttoo.”
   486	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   487	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Ho! ho!” said Mowgli. “Tabaqui came to me not long ago with some rude
   488	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttalk that I was a naked man’s cub and not fit to dig pig-nuts. But I
   489	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcaught Tabaqui by the tail and swung him twice against a palm-tree to
   490	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tteach him better manners.”
   491	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   492	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“That was foolishness, for though Tabaqui is a mischief-maker, he would
   493	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thave told thee of something that concerned thee closely. Open those
   494	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\teyes, Little Brother. Shere Khan dare not kill thee in the jungle. But
   495	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tremember, Akela is very old, and soon the day comes when he cannot kill
   496	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\this buck, and then he will be leader no more. Many of the wolves that
   497	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlooked thee over when thou wast brought to the Council first are old
   498	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttoo, and the young wolves believe, as Shere Khan has taught them, that
   499	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ta man-cub has no place with the Pack. In a little time thou wilt be a
   500	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tman.”
   501	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   502	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“And what is a man that he should not run with his brothers?” said
   503	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMowgli. “I was born in the jungle. I have obeyed the Law of the Jungle,
   504	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand there is no wolf of ours from whose paws I have not pulled a thorn.
   505	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tSurely they are my brothers!”
   506	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   507	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBagheera stretched himself at full length and half shut his eyes.
   508	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Little Brother,” said he, “feel under my jaw.”
   509	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   510	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMowgli put up his strong brown hand, and just under Bagheera’s silky
   511	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tchin, where the giant rolling muscles were all hid by the glossy hair,
   512	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\the came upon a little bald spot.
   513	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   514	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“There is no one in the jungle that knows that I, Bagheera, carry that
   515	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmark--the mark of the collar; and yet, Little Brother, I was born among
   516	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmen, and it was among men that my mother died--in the cages of the
   517	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tking’s palace at Oodeypore. It was because of this that I paid the price
   518	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfor thee at the Council when thou wast a little naked cub. Yes, I too
   519	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twas born among men. I had never seen the jungle. They fed me behind
   520	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbars from an iron pan till one night I felt that I was Bagheera--the
   521	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tPanther--and no man’s plaything, and I broke the silly lock with one
   522	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tblow of my paw and came away. And because I had learned the ways of men,
   523	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tI became more terrible in the jungle than Shere Khan. Is it not so?”
   524	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   525	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Yes,” said Mowgli, “all the jungle fear Bagheera--all except Mowgli.”
   526	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   527	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Oh, thou art a man’s cub,” said the Black Panther very tenderly. “And
   528	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\teven as I returned to my jungle, so thou must go back to men at last--to
   529	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe men who are thy brothers--if thou art not killed in the Council.”
   530	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   531	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“But why--but why should any wish to kill me?” said Mowgli.
   532	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   533	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Look at me,” said Bagheera. And Mowgli looked at him steadily between
   534	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe eyes. The big panther turned his head away in half a minute.
   535	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   536	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“That is why,” he said, shifting his paw on the leaves. “Not even I can
   537	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlook thee between the eyes, and I was born among men, and I love thee,
   538	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tLittle Brother. The others they hate thee because their eyes cannot meet
   539	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthine; because thou art wise; because thou hast pulled out thorns from
   540	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttheir feet--because thou art a man.”
   541	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   542	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I did not know these things,” said Mowgli sullenly, and he frowned
   543	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tunder his heavy black eyebrows.
   544	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   545	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“What is the Law of the Jungle? Strike first and then give tongue. By
   546	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthy very carelessness they know that thou art a man. But be wise. It is
   547	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tin my heart that when Akela misses his next kill--and at each hunt
   548	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tit costs him more to pin the buck--the Pack will turn against him and
   549	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tagainst thee. They will hold a jungle Council at the Rock, and then--and
   550	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthen--I have it!” said Bagheera, leaping up. “Go thou down quickly to
   551	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe men’s huts in the valley, and take some of the Red Flower which they
   552	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgrow there, so that when the time comes thou mayest have even a stronger
   553	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfriend than I or Baloo or those of the Pack that love thee. Get the Red
   554	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tFlower.”
   555	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   556	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBy Red Flower Bagheera meant fire, only no creature in the jungle will
   557	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcall fire by its proper name. Every beast lives in deadly fear of it,
   558	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand invents a hundred ways of describing it.
   559	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   560	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“The Red Flower?” said Mowgli. “That grows outside their huts in the
   561	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttwilight. I will get some.”
   562	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   563	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“There speaks the man’s cub,” said Bagheera proudly. “Remember that it
   564	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgrows in little pots. Get one swiftly, and keep it by thee for time of
   565	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tneed.”
   566	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   567	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Good!” said Mowgli. “I go. But art thou sure, O my Bagheera”--he
   568	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tslipped his arm around the splendid neck and looked deep into the big
   569	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\teyes--“art thou sure that all this is Shere Khan’s doing?”
   570	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   571	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“By the Broken Lock that freed me, I am sure, Little Brother.”
   572	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   573	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Then, by the Bull that bought me, I will pay Shere Khan full tale for
   574	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthis, and it may be a little over,” said Mowgli, and he bounded away.
   575	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   576	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“That is a man. That is all a man,” said Bagheera to himself, lying down
   577	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tagain. “Oh, Shere Khan, never was a blacker hunting than that frog-hunt
   578	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof thine ten years ago!”
   579	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   580	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMowgli was far and far through the forest, running hard, and his heart
   581	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twas hot in him. He came to the cave as the evening mist rose, and drew
   582	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbreath, and looked down the valley. The cubs were out, but Mother
   583	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tWolf, at the back of the cave, knew by his breathing that something was
   584	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttroubling her frog.
   585	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   586	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“What is it, Son?” she said.
   587	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   588	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Some bat’s chatter of Shere Khan,” he called back. “I hunt among the
   589	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tplowed fields tonight,” and he plunged downward through the bushes, to
   590	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe stream at the bottom of the valley. There he checked, for he heard
   591	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe yell of the Pack hunting, heard the bellow of a hunted Sambhur,
   592	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand the snort as the buck turned at bay. Then there were wicked, bitter
   593	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thowls from the young wolves: “Akela! Akela! Let the Lone Wolf show his
   594	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tstrength. Room for the leader of the Pack! Spring, Akela!”
   595	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   596	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe Lone Wolf must have sprung and missed his hold, for Mowgli heard the
   597	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsnap of his teeth and then a yelp as the Sambhur knocked him over with
   598	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\this forefoot.
   599	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   600	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tHe did not wait for anything more, but dashed on; and the yells grew
   601	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfainter behind him as he ran into the croplands where the villagers
   602	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlived.
   603	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   604	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Bagheera spoke truth,” he panted, as he nestled down in some cattle
   605	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfodder by the window of a hut. “To-morrow is one day both for Akela and
   606	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfor me.”
   607	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   608	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThen he pressed his face close to the window and watched the fire on
   609	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe hearth. He saw the husbandman’s wife get up and feed it in the night
   610	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twith black lumps. And when the morning came and the mists were all white
   611	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand cold, he saw the man’s child pick up a wicker pot plastered inside
   612	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twith earth, fill it with lumps of red-hot charcoal, put it under his
   613	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tblanket, and go out to tend the cows in the byre.
   614	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   615	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Is that all?” said Mowgli. “If a cub can do it, there is nothing to
   616	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfear.” So he strode round the corner and met the boy, took the pot from
   617	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\this hand, and disappeared into the mist while the boy howled with fear.
   618	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   619	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“They are very like me,” said Mowgli, blowing into the pot as he had
   620	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tseen the woman do. “This thing will die if I do not give it things to
   621	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\teat”; and he dropped twigs and dried bark on the red stuff. Halfway up
   622	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe hill he met Bagheera with the morning dew shining like moonstones on
   623	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\this coat.
   624	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   625	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Akela has missed,” said the Panther. “They would have killed him last
   626	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnight, but they needed thee also. They were looking for thee on the
   627	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thill.”
   628	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   629	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I was among the plowed lands. I am ready. See!” Mowgli held up the
   630	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfire-pot.
   631	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   632	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Good! Now, I have seen men thrust a dry branch into that stuff, and
   633	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tpresently the Red Flower blossomed at the end of it. Art thou not
   634	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tafraid?”
   635	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   636	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“No. Why should I fear? I remember now--if it is not a dream--how,
   637	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbefore I was a Wolf, I lay beside the Red Flower, and it was warm and
   638	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tpleasant.”
   639	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   640	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tAll that day Mowgli sat in the cave tending his fire pot and dipping
   641	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdry branches into it to see how they looked. He found a branch that
   642	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsatisfied him, and in the evening when Tabaqui came to the cave and told
   643	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thim rudely enough that he was wanted at the Council Rock, he laughed
   644	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttill Tabaqui ran away. Then Mowgli went to the Council, still laughing.
   645	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   646	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tAkela the Lone Wolf lay by the side of his rock as a sign that the
   647	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tleadership of the Pack was open, and Shere Khan with his following of
   648	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tscrap-fed wolves walked to and fro openly being flattered. Bagheera lay
   649	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tclose to Mowgli, and the fire pot was between Mowgli’s knees. When they
   650	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twere all gathered together, Shere Khan began to speak--a thing he would
   651	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnever have dared to do when Akela was in his prime.
   652	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   653	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“He has no right,” whispered Bagheera. “Say so. He is a dog’s son. He
   654	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twill be frightened.”
   655	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   656	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMowgli sprang to his feet. “Free People,” he cried, “does Shere Khan
   657	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlead the Pack? What has a tiger to do with our leadership?”
   658	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   659	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Seeing that the leadership is yet open, and being asked to speak--”
   660	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t Shere Khan began.
   661	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   662	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“By whom?” said Mowgli. “Are we all jackals, to fawn on this cattle
   663	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbutcher? The leadership of the Pack is with the Pack alone.”
   664	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   665	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThere were yells of “Silence, thou man’s cub!” “Let him speak. He has
   666	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tkept our Law”; and at last the seniors of the Pack thundered: “Let the
   667	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tDead Wolf speak.” When a leader of the Pack has missed his kill, he is
   668	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcalled the Dead Wolf as long as he lives, which is not long.
   669	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   670	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tAkela raised his old head wearily:--
   671	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   672	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Free People, and ye too, jackals of Shere Khan, for twelve seasons I
   673	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thave led ye to and from the kill, and in all that time not one has been
   674	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttrapped or maimed. Now I have missed my kill. Ye know how that plot
   675	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twas made. Ye know how ye brought me up to an untried buck to make my
   676	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tweakness known. It was cleverly done. Your right is to kill me here on
   677	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe Council Rock, now. Therefore, I ask, who comes to make an end of the
   678	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tLone Wolf? For it is my right, by the Law of the Jungle, that ye come
   679	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tone by one.”
   680	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   681	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThere was a long hush, for no single wolf cared to fight Akela to
   682	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe death. Then Shere Khan roared: “Bah! What have we to do with this
   683	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttoothless fool? He is doomed to die! It is the man-cub who has lived too
   684	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlong. Free People, he was my meat from the first. Give him to me. I
   685	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tam weary of this man-wolf folly. He has troubled the jungle for ten
   686	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tseasons. Give me the man-cub, or I will hunt here always, and not give
   687	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tyou one bone. He is a man, a man’s child, and from the marrow of my
   688	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbones I hate him!”
   689	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   690	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThen more than half the Pack yelled: “A man! A man! What has a man to do
   691	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twith us? Let him go to his own place.”
   692	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   693	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“And turn all the people of the villages against us?” clamored Shere
   694	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tKhan. “No, give him to me. He is a man, and none of us can look him
   695	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbetween the eyes.”
   696	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   697	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tAkela lifted his head again and said, “He has eaten our food. He has
   698	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tslept with us. He has driven game for us. He has broken no word of the
   699	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tLaw of the Jungle.”
   700	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   701	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Also, I paid for him with a bull when he was accepted. The worth of a
   702	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbull is little, but Bagheera’s honor is something that he will perhaps
   703	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfight for,” said Bagheera in his gentlest voice.
   704	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   705	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“A bull paid ten years ago!” the Pack snarled. “What do we care for
   706	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbones ten years old?”
   707	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   708	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Or for a pledge?” said Bagheera, his white teeth bared under his lip.
   709	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Well are ye called the Free People!”
   710	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   711	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“No man’s cub can run with the people of the jungle,” howled Shere Khan.
   712	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Give him to me!”
   713	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   714	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“He is our brother in all but blood,” Akela went on, “and ye would kill
   715	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thim here! In truth, I have lived too long. Some of ye are eaters of
   716	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcattle, and of others I have heard that, under Shere Khan’s teaching,
   717	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tye go by dark night and snatch children from the villager’s doorstep.
   718	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tTherefore I know ye to be cowards, and it is to cowards I speak. It is
   719	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcertain that I must die, and my life is of no worth, or I would offer
   720	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthat in the man-cub’s place. But for the sake of the Honor of
   721	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe Pack,--a little matter that by being without a leader ye have
   722	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tforgotten,--I promise that if ye let the man-cub go to his own place, I
   723	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twill not, when my time comes to die, bare one tooth against ye. I will
   724	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdie without fighting. That will at least save the Pack three lives.
   725	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMore I cannot do; but if ye will, I can save ye the shame that comes of
   726	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tkilling a brother against whom there is no fault--a brother spoken for
   727	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand bought into the Pack according to the Law of the Jungle.”

   729	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“He is a man--a man--a man!” snarled the Pack. And most of the wolves
   730	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbegan to gather round Shere Khan, whose tail was beginning to switch.
   731	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   732	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Now the business is in thy hands,” said Bagheera to Mowgli. “We can do
   733	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tno more except fight.”
   734	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   735	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMowgli stood upright--the fire pot in his hands. Then he stretched out
   736	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\this arms, and yawned in the face of the Council; but he was furious with
   737	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\trage and sorrow, for, wolflike, the wolves had never told him how they
   738	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thated him. “Listen you!” he cried. “There is no need for this dog’s
   739	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tjabber. Ye have told me so often tonight that I am a man (and indeed I
   740	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twould have been a wolf with you to my life’s end) that I feel your words
   741	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tare true. So I do not call ye my brothers any more, but sag [dogs], as
   742	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ta man should. What ye will do, and what ye will not do, is not yours
   743	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto say. That matter is with me; and that we may see the matter more
   744	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tplainly, I, the man, have brought here a little of the Red Flower which
   745	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tye, dogs, fear.”
   746	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   747	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tHe flung the fire pot on the ground, and some of the red coals lit
   748	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ta tuft of dried moss that flared up, as all the Council drew back in
   749	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tterror before the leaping flames.
   750	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   751	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMowgli thrust his dead branch into the fire till the twigs lit and
   752	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcrackled, and whirled it above his head among the cowering wolves.
   753	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   754	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Thou art the master,” said Bagheera in an undertone. “Save Akela from
   755	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe death. He was ever thy friend.”
   756	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   757	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tAkela, the grim old wolf who had never asked for mercy in his life, gave
   758	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tone piteous look at Mowgli as the boy stood all naked, his long black
   759	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thair tossing over his shoulders in the light of the blazing branch that
   760	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmade the shadows jump and quiver.
   761	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   762	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Good!” said Mowgli, staring round slowly. “I see that ye are dogs. I go
   763	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfrom you to my own people--if they be my own people. The jungle is shut
   764	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto me, and I must forget your talk and your companionship. But I will be
   765	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmore merciful than ye are. Because I was all but your brother in blood,
   766	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tI promise that when I am a man among men I will not betray ye to men as
   767	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tye have betrayed me.” He kicked the fire with his foot, and the sparks
   768	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tflew up. “There shall be no war between any of us in the Pack. But here
   769	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tis a debt to pay before I go.” He strode forward to where Shere Khan sat
   770	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tblinking stupidly at the flames, and caught him by the tuft on his chin.
   771	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBagheera followed in case of accidents. “Up, dog!” Mowgli cried. “Up,
   772	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twhen a man speaks, or I will set that coat ablaze!”
   773	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   774	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tShere Khan’s ears lay flat back on his head, and he shut his eyes, for
   775	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe blazing branch was very near.
   776	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   777	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“This cattle-killer said he would kill me in the Council because he had
   778	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnot killed me when I was a cub. Thus and thus, then, do we beat dogs
   779	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twhen we are men. Stir a whisker, Lungri, and I ram the Red Flower down
   780	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthy gullet!” He beat Shere Khan over the head with the branch, and the
   781	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttiger whimpered and whined in an agony of fear.
   782	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   783	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Pah! Singed jungle cat--go now! But remember when next I come to the
   784	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tCouncil Rock, as a man should come, it will be with Shere Khan’s hide
   785	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ton my head. For the rest, Akela goes free to live as he pleases. Ye will
   786	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnot kill him, because that is not my will. Nor do I think that ye
   787	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twill sit here any longer, lolling out your tongues as though ye were
   788	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsomebodies, instead of dogs whom I drive out--thus! Go!” The fire was
   789	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tburning furiously at the end of the branch, and Mowgli struck right
   790	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand left round the circle, and the wolves ran howling with the sparks
   791	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tburning their fur. At last there were only Akela, Bagheera, and perhaps
   792	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tten wolves that had taken Mowgli’s part. Then something began to hurt
   793	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMowgli inside him, as he had never been hurt in his life before, and he
   794	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcaught his breath and sobbed, and the tears ran down his face.
   795	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   796	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“What is it? What is it?” he said. “I do not wish to leave the jungle,
   797	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand I do not know what this is. Am I dying, Bagheera?”
   798	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   799	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“No, Little Brother. That is only tears such as men use,” said Bagheera.
   800	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Now I know thou art a man, and a man’s cub no longer. The jungle is
   801	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tshut indeed to thee henceforward. Let them fall, Mowgli. They are only
   802	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttears.” So Mowgli sat and cried as though his heart would break; and he
   803	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thad never cried in all his life before.
   804	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   805	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Now,” he said, “I will go to men. But first I must say farewell to my
   806	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmother.” And he went to the cave where she lived with Father Wolf, and
   807	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\the cried on her coat, while the four cubs howled miserably.
   808	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   809	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Ye will not forget me?” said Mowgli.
   810	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   811	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Never while we can follow a trail,” said the cubs. “Come to the foot of
   812	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe hill when thou art a man, and we will talk to thee; and we will come
   813	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tinto the croplands to play with thee by night.”
   814	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   815	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Come soon!” said Father Wolf. “Oh, wise little frog, come again soon;
   816	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfor we be old, thy mother and I.”
   817	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   818	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Come soon,” said Mother Wolf, “little naked son of mine. For, listen,
   819	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tchild of man, I loved thee more than ever I loved my cubs.”
   820	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   821	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I will surely come,” said Mowgli. “And when I come it will be to lay
   822	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tout Shere Khan’s hide upon the Council Rock. Do not forget me! Tell them
   823	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tin the jungle never to forget me!”
   824	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   825	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe dawn was beginning to break when Mowgli went down the hillside
   826	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\talone, to meet those mysterious things that are called men.

   847	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     As the dawn was breaking the Wolf Pack yelled

   877	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   878	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   879	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tAll that is told here happened some time before Mowgli was turned out of
   880	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe Seeonee Wolf Pack, or revenged himself on Shere Khan the tiger. It
   881	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twas in the days when Baloo was teaching him the Law of the Jungle. The
   882	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbig, serious, old brown bear was delighted to have so quick a pupil,
   883	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfor the young wolves will only learn as much of the Law of the Jungle
   884	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tas applies to their own pack and tribe, and run away as soon as they can
   885	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\trepeat the Hunting Verse--“Feet that make no noise; eyes that can see in
   886	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe dark; ears that can hear the winds in their lairs, and sharp white
   887	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tteeth, all these things are the marks of our brothers except Tabaqui the
   888	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tJackal and the Hyaena whom we hate.” But Mowgli, as a man-cub, had to
   889	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlearn a great deal more than this. Sometimes Bagheera the Black Panther
   890	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twould come lounging through the jungle to see how his pet was getting
   891	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ton, and would purr with his head against a tree while Mowgli recited the
   892	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tday’s lesson to Baloo. The boy could climb almost as well as he could
   893	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tswim, and swim almost as well as he could run. So Baloo, the Teacher of
   894	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe Law, taught him the Wood and Water Laws: how to tell a rotten branch
   895	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfrom a sound one; how to speak politely to the wild bees when he came
   896	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tupon a hive of them fifty feet above ground; what to say to Mang the
   897	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBat when he disturbed him in the branches at midday; and how to warn the
   898	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twater-snakes in the pools before he splashed down among them. None of
   899	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe Jungle People like being disturbed, and all are very ready to fly at
   900	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tan intruder. Then, too, Mowgli was taught the Strangers’ Hunting Call,
   901	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twhich must be repeated aloud till it is answered, whenever one of the
   902	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tJungle-People hunts outside his own grounds. It means, translated, “Give
   903	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tme leave to hunt here because I am hungry.” And the answer is, “Hunt
   904	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthen for food, but not for pleasure.”
   905	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   906	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tAll this will show you how much Mowgli had to learn by heart, and he
   907	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgrew very tired of saying the same thing over a hundred times. But, as
   908	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBaloo said to Bagheera, one day when Mowgli had been cuffed and run off
   909	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tin a temper, “A man’s cub is a man’s cub, and he must learn all the Law
   910	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof the Jungle.”
   911	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   912	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“But think how small he is,” said the Black Panther, who would have
   913	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tspoiled Mowgli if he had had his own way. “How can his little head carry
   914	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tall thy long talk?”
   915	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   916	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Is there anything in the jungle too little to be killed? No. That is
   917	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twhy I teach him these things, and that is why I hit him, very softly,
   918	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twhen he forgets.”
   919	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   920	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Softly! What dost thou know of softness, old Iron-feet?” Bagheera
   921	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgrunted. “His face is all bruised today by thy--softness. Ugh.”
   922	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   923	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Better he should be bruised from head to foot by me who love him than
   924	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthat he should come to harm through ignorance,” Baloo answered very
   925	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tearnestly. “I am now teaching him the Master Words of the Jungle that
   926	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tshall protect him with the birds and the Snake People, and all that hunt
   927	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ton four feet, except his own pack. He can now claim protection, if he
   928	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twill only remember the words, from all in the jungle. Is not that worth
   929	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ta little beating?”
   930	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   931	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Well, look to it then that thou dost not kill the man-cub. He is no
   932	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttree trunk to sharpen thy blunt claws upon. But what are those Master
   933	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tWords? I am more likely to give help than to ask it”--Bagheera stretched
   934	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tout one paw and admired the steel-blue, ripping-chisel talons at the end
   935	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof it--“still I should like to know.”
   936	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   937	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I will call Mowgli and he shall say them--if he will. Come, Little
   938	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBrother!”
   939	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   940	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“My head is ringing like a bee tree,” said a sullen little voice over
   941	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttheir heads, and Mowgli slid down a tree trunk very angry and indignant,
   942	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tadding as he reached the ground: “I come for Bagheera and not for thee,
   943	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfat old Baloo!”
   944	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   945	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“That is all one to me,” said Baloo, though he was hurt and grieved.
   946	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Tell Bagheera, then, the Master Words of the Jungle that I have taught
   947	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthee this day.”
   948	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   949	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Master Words for which people?” said Mowgli, delighted to show off.
   950	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“The jungle has many tongues. I know them all.”
   951	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   952	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“A little thou knowest, but not much. See, O Bagheera, they never thank
   953	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttheir teacher. Not one small wolfling has ever come back to thank
   954	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\told Baloo for his teachings. Say the word for the Hunting-People,
   955	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthen--great scholar.”
   956	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   957	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“We be of one blood, ye and I,” said Mowgli, giving the words the Bear

   959	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   960	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Good. Now for the birds.”
   961	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   962	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMowgli repeated, with the Kite’s whistle at the end of the sentence.
   963	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   964	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Now for the Snake-People,” said Bagheera.
   965	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   966	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe answer was a perfectly indescribable hiss, and Mowgli kicked up his
   967	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfeet behind, clapped his hands together to applaud himself, and jumped
   968	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ton to Bagheera’s back, where he sat sideways, drumming with his heels on
   969	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe glossy skin and making the worst faces he could think of at Baloo.
   970	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   971	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“There--there! That was worth a little bruise,” said the brown bear
   972	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttenderly. “Some day thou wilt remember me.” Then he turned aside to
   973	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttell Bagheera how he had begged the Master Words from Hathi the Wild
   974	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tElephant, who knows all about these things, and how Hathi had taken
   975	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMowgli down to a pool to get the Snake Word from a water-snake, because
   976	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBaloo could not pronounce it, and how Mowgli was now reasonably safe
   977	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tagainst all accidents in the jungle, because neither snake, bird, nor
   978	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbeast would hurt him.
   979	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   980	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“No one then is to be feared,” Baloo wound up, patting his big furry
   981	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tstomach with pride.
   982	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   983	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Except his own tribe,” said Bagheera, under his breath; and then aloud
   984	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto Mowgli, “Have a care for my ribs, Little Brother! What is all this
   985	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdancing up and down?”
   986	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   987	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMowgli had been trying to make himself heard by pulling at Bagheera’s
   988	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tshoulder fur and kicking hard. When the two listened to him he was
   989	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tshouting at the top of his voice, “And so I shall have a tribe of my
   990	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\town, and lead them through the branches all day long.”
   991	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   992	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“What is this new folly, little dreamer of dreams?” said Bagheera.
   993	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   994	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Yes, and throw branches and dirt at old Baloo,” Mowgli went on. “They
   995	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thave promised me this. Ah!”
   996	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
   997	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Whoof!” Baloo’s big paw scooped Mowgli off Bagheera’s back, and as the
   998	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tboy lay between the big fore-paws he could see the Bear was angry.
   999	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1000	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Mowgli,” said Baloo, “thou hast been talking with the Bandar-log--the
  1001	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMonkey People.”
  1002	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1003	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMowgli looked at Bagheera to see if the Panther was angry too, and
  1004	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBagheera’s eyes were as hard as jade stones.
  1005	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1006	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Thou hast been with the Monkey People--the gray apes--the people
  1007	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twithout a law--the eaters of everything. That is great shame.”
  1008	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1009	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“When Baloo hurt my head,” said Mowgli (he was still on his back), “I
  1010	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twent away, and the gray apes came down from the trees and had pity on
  1011	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tme. No one else cared.” He snuffled a little.
  1012	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1013	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“The pity of the Monkey People!” Baloo snorted. “The stillness of the
  1014	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmountain stream! The cool of the summer sun! And then, man-cub?”
  1015	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1016	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“And then, and then, they gave me nuts and pleasant things to eat, and
  1017	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthey--they carried me in their arms up to the top of the trees and said
  1018	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tI was their blood brother except that I had no tail, and should be their
  1019	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tleader some day.”
  1020	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1021	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“They have no leader,” said Bagheera. “They lie. They have always lied.”
  1022	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1023	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“They were very kind and bade me come again. Why have I never been taken
  1024	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tamong the Monkey People? They stand on their feet as I do. They do
  1025	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnot hit me with their hard paws. They play all day. Let me get up! Bad
  1026	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBaloo, let me up! I will play with them again.”
  1027	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1028	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Listen, man-cub,” said the Bear, and his voice rumbled like thunder on
  1029	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ta hot night. “I have taught thee all the Law of the Jungle for all the
  1030	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tpeoples of the jungle--except the Monkey-Folk who live in the trees.
  1031	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThey have no law. They are outcasts. They have no speech of their own,
  1032	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbut use the stolen words which they overhear when they listen, and peep,
  1033	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand wait up above in the branches. Their way is not our way. They are
  1034	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twithout leaders. They have no remembrance. They boast and chatter and
  1035	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tpretend that they are a great people about to do great affairs in the
  1036	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tjungle, but the falling of a nut turns their minds to laughter and all
  1037	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tis forgotten. We of the jungle have no dealings with them. We do not
  1038	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdrink where the monkeys drink; we do not go where the monkeys go; we do
  1039	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnot hunt where they hunt; we do not die where they die. Hast thou ever
  1040	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\theard me speak of the Bandar-log till today?”
  1041	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1042	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“No,” said Mowgli in a whisper, for the forest was very still now Baloo
  1043	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thad finished.
  1044	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1045	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“The Jungle-People put them out of their mouths and out of their minds.
  1046	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThey are very many, evil, dirty, shameless, and they desire, if they
  1047	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thave any fixed desire, to be noticed by the Jungle People. But we do not
  1048	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnotice them even when they throw nuts and filth on our heads.”
  1049	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1050	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tHe had hardly spoken when a shower of nuts and twigs spattered down
  1051	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthrough the branches; and they could hear coughings and howlings and
  1052	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tangry jumpings high up in the air among the thin branches.
  1053	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1054	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“The Monkey-People are forbidden,” said Baloo, “forbidden to the
  1055	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tJungle-People. Remember.”
  1056	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1057	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Forbidden,” said Bagheera, “but I still think Baloo should have warned
  1058	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthee against them.”
  1059	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1060	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I--I? How was I to guess he would play with such dirt. The Monkey
  1061	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tPeople! Faugh!”
  1062	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1063	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tA fresh shower came down on their heads and the two trotted away, taking
  1064	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMowgli with them. What Baloo had said about the monkeys was perfectly
  1065	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttrue. They belonged to the tree-tops, and as beasts very seldom look
  1066	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tup, there was no occasion for the monkeys and the Jungle-People to cross
  1067	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\teach other’s path. But whenever they found a sick wolf, or a wounded
  1068	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttiger, or bear, the monkeys would torment him, and would throw sticks
  1069	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand nuts at any beast for fun and in the hope of being noticed. Then
  1070	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthey would howl and shriek senseless songs, and invite the Jungle-People
  1071	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto climb up their trees and fight them, or would start furious battles
  1072	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tover nothing among themselves, and leave the dead monkeys where the
  1073	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tJungle-People could see them. They were always just going to have a
  1074	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tleader, and laws and customs of their own, but they never did, because
  1075	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttheir memories would not hold over from day to day, and so they
  1076	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcompromised things by making up a saying, “What the Bandar-log think now
  1077	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe jungle will think later,” and that comforted them a great deal. None
  1078	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof the beasts could reach them, but on the other hand none of the beasts
  1079	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twould notice them, and that was why they were so pleased when Mowgli
  1080	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcame to play with them, and they heard how angry Baloo was.
  1081	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1082	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThey never meant to do any more--the Bandar-log never mean anything at
  1083	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tall; but one of them invented what seemed to him a brilliant idea, and
  1084	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\the told all the others that Mowgli would be a useful person to keep in
  1085	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe tribe, because he could weave sticks together for protection from
  1086	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe wind; so, if they caught him, they could make him teach them.
  1087	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tOf course Mowgli, as a woodcutter’s child, inherited all sorts of
  1088	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tinstincts, and used to make little huts of fallen branches without
  1089	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthinking how he came to do it. The Monkey-People, watching in the trees,
  1090	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tconsidered his play most wonderful. This time, they said, they were
  1091	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\treally going to have a leader and become the wisest people in the
  1092	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tjungle--so wise that everyone else would notice and envy them. Therefore
  1093	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthey followed Baloo and Bagheera and Mowgli through the jungle very
  1094	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tquietly till it was time for the midday nap, and Mowgli, who was
  1095	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tvery much ashamed of himself, slept between the Panther and the Bear,
  1096	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tresolving to have no more to do with the Monkey People.
  1097	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1098	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe next thing he remembered was feeling hands on his legs and
  1099	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tarms--hard, strong, little hands--and then a swash of branches in his
  1100	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tface, and then he was staring down through the swaying boughs as Baloo
  1101	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twoke the jungle with his deep cries and Bagheera bounded up the trunk
  1102	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twith every tooth bared. The Bandar-log howled with triumph and scuffled
  1103	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\taway to the upper branches where Bagheera dared not follow, shouting:
  1104	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“He has noticed us! Bagheera has noticed us. All the Jungle-People
  1105	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tadmire us for our skill and our cunning.” Then they began their flight;
  1106	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand the flight of the Monkey-People through tree-land is one of
  1107	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe things nobody can describe. They have their regular roads and
  1108	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcrossroads, up hills and down hills, all laid out from fifty to seventy
  1109	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tor a hundred feet above ground, and by these they can travel even at
  1110	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnight if necessary. Two of the strongest monkeys caught Mowgli under
  1111	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe arms and swung off with him through the treetops, twenty feet at a
  1112	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbound. Had they been alone they could have gone twice as fast, but the
  1113	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tboy’s weight held them back. Sick and giddy as Mowgli was he could not
  1114	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thelp enjoying the wild rush, though the glimpses of earth far down below
  1115	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfrightened him, and the terrible check and jerk at the end of the swing
  1116	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tover nothing but empty air brought his heart between his teeth. His
  1117	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tescort would rush him up a tree till he felt the thinnest topmost
  1118	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbranches crackle and bend under them, and then with a cough and a whoop
  1119	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twould fling themselves into the air outward and downward, and bring
  1120	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tup, hanging by their hands or their feet to the lower limbs of the next
  1121	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttree. Sometimes he could see for miles and miles across the still green
  1122	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tjungle, as a man on the top of a mast can see for miles across the sea,
  1123	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand then the branches and leaves would lash him across the face, and he
  1124	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand his two guards would be almost down to earth again. So, bounding and
  1125	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcrashing and whooping and yelling, the whole tribe of Bandar-log swept
  1126	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\talong the tree-roads with Mowgli their prisoner.
  1127	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1128	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tFor a time he was afraid of being dropped. Then he grew angry but knew
  1129	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbetter than to struggle, and then he began to think. The first thing was
  1130	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto send back word to Baloo and Bagheera, for, at the pace the monkeys
  1131	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twere going, he knew his friends would be left far behind. It was useless
  1132	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto look down, for he could only see the topsides of the branches, so he
  1133	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tstared upward and saw, far away in the blue, Rann the Kite balancing
  1134	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand wheeling as he kept watch over the jungle waiting for things to die.
  1135	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tRann saw that the monkeys were carrying something, and dropped a
  1136	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfew hundred yards to find out whether their load was good to eat. He
  1137	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twhistled with surprise when he saw Mowgli being dragged up to a treetop
  1138	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand heard him give the Kite call for--“We be of one blood, thou and I.”
  1139	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t The waves of the branches closed over the boy, but Rann balanced away to
  1140	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe next tree in time to see the little brown face come up again. “Mark
  1141	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmy trail!” Mowgli shouted. “Tell Baloo of the Seeonee Pack and Bagheera
  1142	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof the Council Rock.”
  1143	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1144	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“In whose name, Brother?” Rann had never seen Mowgli before, though of
  1145	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcourse he had heard of him.
  1146	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1147	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Mowgli, the Frog. Man-cub they call me! Mark my trail!”
  1148	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1149	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe last words were shrieked as he was being swung through the air, but
  1150	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tRann nodded and rose up till he looked no bigger than a speck of dust,
  1151	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand there he hung, watching with his telescope eyes the swaying of the
  1152	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttreetops as Mowgli’s escort whirled along.
  1153	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1154	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“They never go far,” he said with a chuckle. “They never do what they
  1155	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tset out to do. Always pecking at new things are the Bandar-log. This
  1156	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttime, if I have any eye-sight, they have pecked down trouble for
  1157	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthemselves, for Baloo is no fledgling and Bagheera can, as I know, kill
  1158	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmore than goats.”
  1159	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1160	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tSo he rocked on his wings, his feet gathered up under him, and waited.
  1161	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1162	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMeantime, Baloo and Bagheera were furious with rage and grief. Bagheera
  1163	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tclimbed as he had never climbed before, but the thin branches broke
  1164	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbeneath his weight, and he slipped down, his claws full of bark.
  1165	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1166	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Why didst thou not warn the man-cub?” he roared to poor Baloo, who had
  1167	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tset off at a clumsy trot in the hope of overtaking the monkeys. “What
  1168	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twas the use of half slaying him with blows if thou didst not warn him?”
  1169	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1170	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Haste! O haste! We--we may catch them yet!” Baloo panted.
  1171	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1172	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“At that speed! It would not tire a wounded cow. Teacher of the
  1173	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tLaw--cub-beater--a mile of that rolling to and fro would burst thee
  1174	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\topen. Sit still and think! Make a plan. This is no time for chasing.
  1175	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThey may drop him if we follow too close.”
  1176	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1177	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Arrula! Whoo! They may have dropped him already, being tired of
  1178	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcarrying him. Who can trust the Bandar-log? Put dead bats on my head!
  1179	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tGive me black bones to eat! Roll me into the hives of the wild bees
  1180	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthat I may be stung to death, and bury me with the Hyaena, for I am most
  1181	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmiserable of bears! Arulala! Wahooa! O Mowgli, Mowgli! Why did I not
  1182	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twarn thee against the Monkey-Folk instead of breaking thy head? Now
  1183	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tperhaps I may have knocked the day’s lesson out of his mind, and he will
  1184	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbe alone in the jungle without the Master Words.”
  1185	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1186	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBaloo clasped his paws over his ears and rolled to and fro moaning.
  1187	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1188	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“At least he gave me all the Words correctly a little time ago,” said
  1189	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBagheera impatiently. “Baloo, thou hast neither memory nor respect. What
  1190	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twould the jungle think if I, the Black Panther, curled myself up like
  1191	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tIkki the Porcupine, and howled?”
  1192	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1193	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“What do I care what the jungle thinks? He may be dead by now.”
  1194	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1195	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Unless and until they drop him from the branches in sport, or kill him
  1196	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tout of idleness, I have no fear for the man-cub. He is wise and well
  1197	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttaught, and above all he has the eyes that make the Jungle-People
  1198	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tafraid. But (and it is a great evil) he is in the power of the
  1199	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBandar-log, and they, because they live in trees, have no fear of any of
  1200	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tour people.” Bagheera licked one forepaw thoughtfully.
  1201	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1202	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Fool that I am! Oh, fat, brown, root-digging fool that I am,” said
  1203	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBaloo, uncoiling himself with a jerk, “it is true what Hathi the Wild
  1204	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tElephant says: `To each his own fear’; and they, the Bandar-log, fear
  1205	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tKaa the Rock Snake. He can climb as well as they can. He steals the
  1206	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tyoung monkeys in the night. The whisper of his name makes their wicked
  1207	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttails cold. Let us go to Kaa.”
  1208	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1209	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“What will he do for us? He is not of our tribe, being footless--and
  1210	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twith most evil eyes,” said Bagheera.
  1211	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1212	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“He is very old and very cunning. Above all, he is always hungry,” said
  1213	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBaloo hopefully. “Promise him many goats.”
  1214	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1215	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“He sleeps for a full month after he has once eaten. He may be asleep
  1216	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnow, and even were he awake what if he would rather kill his own goats?”
  1217	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t Bagheera, who did not know much about Kaa, was naturally suspicious.
  1218	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1219	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Then in that case, thou and I together, old hunter, might make him see
  1220	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\treason.” Here Baloo rubbed his faded brown shoulder against the Panther,
  1221	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand they went off to look for Kaa the Rock Python.
  1222	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1223	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThey found him stretched out on a warm ledge in the afternoon sun,
  1224	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tadmiring his beautiful new coat, for he had been in retirement for the
  1225	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlast ten days changing his skin, and now he was very splendid--darting
  1226	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\this big blunt-nosed head along the ground, and twisting the thirty feet
  1227	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof his body into fantastic knots and curves, and licking his lips as he
  1228	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthought of his dinner to come.
  1229	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1230	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“He has not eaten,” said Baloo, with a grunt of relief, as soon as
  1231	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\the saw the beautifully mottled brown and yellow jacket. “Be careful,
  1232	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBagheera! He is always a little blind after he has changed his skin, and
  1233	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tvery quick to strike.”
  1234	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1235	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tKaa was not a poison snake--in fact he rather despised the poison snakes
  1236	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tas cowards--but his strength lay in his hug, and when he had once
  1237	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlapped his huge coils round anybody there was no more to be said. “Good
  1238	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thunting!” cried Baloo, sitting up on his haunches. Like all snakes of
  1239	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\this breed Kaa was rather deaf, and did not hear the call at first. Then
  1240	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\the curled up ready for any accident, his head lowered.
  1241	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1242	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Good hunting for us all,” he answered. “Oho, Baloo, what dost thou do
  1243	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\there? Good hunting, Bagheera. One of us at least needs food. Is there
  1244	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tany news of game afoot? A doe now, or even a young buck? I am as empty
  1245	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tas a dried well.”
  1246	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1247	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“We are hunting,” said Baloo carelessly. He knew that you must not hurry
  1248	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tKaa. He is too big.
  1249	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1250	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Give me permission to come with you,” said Kaa. “A blow more or less is
  1251	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnothing to thee, Bagheera or Baloo, but I--I have to wait and wait for
  1252	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdays in a wood-path and climb half a night on the mere chance of a
  1253	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tyoung ape. Psshaw! The branches are not what they were when I was young.
  1254	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tRotten twigs and dry boughs are they all.”
  1255	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1256	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Maybe thy great weight has something to do with the matter,” said
  1257	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBaloo.
  1258	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1259	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I am a fair length--a fair length,” said Kaa with a little pride. “But
  1260	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfor all that, it is the fault of this new-grown timber. I came very
  1261	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnear to falling on my last hunt--very near indeed--and the noise of my
  1262	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tslipping, for my tail was not tight wrapped around the tree, waked the
  1263	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBandar-log, and they called me most evil names.”
  1264	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1265	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Footless, yellow earth-worm,” said Bagheera under his whiskers, as
  1266	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthough he were trying to remember something.
  1267	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1268	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Sssss! Have they ever called me that?” said Kaa.
  1269	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1270	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Something of that kind it was that they shouted to us last moon, but we
  1271	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnever noticed them. They will say anything--even that thou hast lost all
  1272	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthy teeth, and wilt not face anything bigger than a kid, because (they
  1273	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tare indeed shameless, these Bandar-log)--because thou art afraid of the
  1274	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\the-goat’s horns,” Bagheera went on sweetly.
  1275	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1276	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tNow a snake, especially a wary old python like Kaa, very seldom shows
  1277	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthat he is angry, but Baloo and Bagheera could see the big swallowing
  1278	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmuscles on either side of Kaa’s throat ripple and bulge.
  1279	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1280	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“The Bandar-log have shifted their grounds,” he said quietly. “When I
  1281	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcame up into the sun today I heard them whooping among the tree-tops.”
  1282	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1283	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“It--it is the Bandar-log that we follow now,” said Baloo, but the words
  1284	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tstuck in his throat, for that was the first time in his memory that one
  1285	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof the Jungle-People had owned to being interested in the doings of the
  1286	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmonkeys.
  1287	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1288	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Beyond doubt then it is no small thing that takes two such
  1289	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thunters--leaders in their own jungle I am certain--on the trail of the
  1290	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBandar-log,” Kaa replied courteously, as he swelled with curiosity.
  1291	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1292	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Indeed,” Baloo began, “I am no more than the old and sometimes very
  1293	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfoolish Teacher of the Law to the Seeonee wolf-cubs, and Bagheera
  1294	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\there--”
  1295	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1296	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Is Bagheera,” said the Black Panther, and his jaws shut with a snap,
  1297	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfor he did not believe in being humble. “The trouble is this, Kaa. Those
  1298	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnut-stealers and pickers of palm leaves have stolen away our man-cub of
  1299	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twhom thou hast perhaps heard.”
  1300	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1301	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I heard some news from Ikki (his quills make him presumptuous) of a
  1302	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tman-thing that was entered into a wolf pack, but I did not believe. Ikki
  1303	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tis full of stories half heard and very badly told.”
  1304	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1305	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“But it is true. He is such a man-cub as never was,” said Baloo. “The
  1306	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbest and wisest and boldest of man-cubs--my own pupil, who shall
  1307	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmake the name of Baloo famous through all the jungles; and besides,
  1308	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tI--we--love him, Kaa.”
  1309	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1310	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Ts! Ts!” said Kaa, weaving his head to and fro. “I also have known what
  1311	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlove is. There are tales I could tell that--”
  1312	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1313	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“That need a clear night when we are all well fed to praise properly,”
  1314	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t said Bagheera quickly. “Our man-cub is in the hands of the Bandar-log
  1315	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnow, and we know that of all the Jungle-People they fear Kaa alone.”
  1316	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1317	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“They fear me alone. They have good reason,” said Kaa. “Chattering,
  1318	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfoolish, vain--vain, foolish, and chattering, are the monkeys. But a
  1319	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tman-thing in their hands is in no good luck. They grow tired of the nuts
  1320	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthey pick, and throw them down. They carry a branch half a day, meaning
  1321	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto do great things with it, and then they snap it in two. That man-thing
  1322	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tis not to be envied. They called me also--`yellow fish’ was it not?”
  1323	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1324	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Worm--worm--earth-worm,” said Bagheera, “as well as other things which
  1325	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tI cannot now say for shame.”
  1326	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1327	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“We must remind them to speak well of their master. Aaa-ssp! We must
  1328	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thelp their wandering memories. Now, whither went they with the cub?”
  1329	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1330	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“The jungle alone knows. Toward the sunset, I believe,” said Baloo. “We
  1331	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thad thought that thou wouldst know, Kaa.”
  1332	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1333	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I? How? I take them when they come in my way, but I do not hunt the
  1334	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBandar-log, or frogs--or green scum on a water-hole, for that matter.”
  1335	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1336	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Up, Up! Up, Up! Hillo! Illo! Illo, look up, Baloo of the Seeonee Wolf
  1337	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tPack!”
  1338	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1339	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBaloo looked up to see where the voice came from, and there was Rann the
  1340	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tKite, sweeping down with the sun shining on the upturned flanges of his
  1341	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twings. It was near Rann’s bedtime, but he had ranged all over the jungle
  1342	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlooking for the Bear and had missed him in the thick foliage.
  1343	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1344	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“What is it?” said Baloo.
  1345	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1346	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I have seen Mowgli among the Bandar-log. He bade me tell you. I
  1347	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twatched. The Bandar-log have taken him beyond the river to the monkey
  1348	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcity--to the Cold Lairs. They may stay there for a night, or ten nights,
  1349	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tor an hour. I have told the bats to watch through the dark time. That is
  1350	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmy message. Good hunting, all you below!”
  1351	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1352	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Full gorge and a deep sleep to you, Rann,” cried Bagheera. “I will
  1353	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tremember thee in my next kill, and put aside the head for thee alone, O
  1354	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbest of kites!”
  1355	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1356	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“It is nothing. It is nothing. The boy held the Master Word. I could
  1357	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thave done no less,” and Rann circled up again to his roost.
  1358	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1359	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“He has not forgotten to use his tongue,” said Baloo with a chuckle of
  1360	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tpride. “To think of one so young remembering the Master Word for the
  1361	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbirds too while he was being pulled across trees!”
  1362	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1363	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“It was most firmly driven into him,” said Bagheera. “But I am proud of
  1364	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thim, and now we must go to the Cold Lairs.”
  1365	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1366	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThey all knew where that place was, but few of the Jungle People ever
  1367	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twent there, because what they called the Cold Lairs was an old deserted
  1368	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcity, lost and buried in the jungle, and beasts seldom use a place that
  1369	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmen have once used. The wild boar will, but the hunting tribes do not.
  1370	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBesides, the monkeys lived there as much as they could be said to live
  1371	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tanywhere, and no self-respecting animal would come within eyeshot of it
  1372	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\texcept in times of drought, when the half-ruined tanks and reservoirs
  1373	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\theld a little water.
  1374	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1375	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“It is half a night’s journey--at full speed,” said Bagheera, and Baloo
  1376	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlooked very serious. “I will go as fast as I can,” he said anxiously.
  1377	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1378	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“We dare not wait for thee. Follow, Baloo. We must go on the
  1379	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tquick-foot--Kaa and I.”
  1380	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1381	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Feet or no feet, I can keep abreast of all thy four,” said Kaa shortly.
  1382	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBaloo made one effort to hurry, but had to sit down panting, and so they
  1383	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tleft him to come on later, while Bagheera hurried forward, at the quick
  1384	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tpanther-canter. Kaa said nothing, but, strive as Bagheera might, the
  1385	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thuge Rock-python held level with him. When they came to a hill stream,
  1386	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBagheera gained, because he bounded across while Kaa swam, his head and
  1387	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttwo feet of his neck clearing the water, but on level ground Kaa made up
  1388	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe distance.
  1389	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1390	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“By the Broken Lock that freed me,” said Bagheera, when twilight had
  1391	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfallen, “thou art no slow goer!”
  1392	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1393	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I am hungry,” said Kaa. “Besides, they called me speckled frog.”
  1394	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1395	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Worm--earth-worm, and yellow to boot.”
  1396	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1397	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“All one. Let us go on,” and Kaa seemed to pour himself along the
  1398	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tground, finding the shortest road with his steady eyes, and keeping to
  1399	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tit.
  1400	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1401	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tIn the Cold Lairs the Monkey-People were not thinking of Mowgli’s
  1402	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfriends at all. They had brought the boy to the Lost City, and were
  1403	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tvery much pleased with themselves for the time. Mowgli had never seen an
  1404	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tIndian city before, and though this was almost a heap of ruins it seemed
  1405	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tvery wonderful and splendid. Some king had built it long ago on a little
  1406	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thill. You could still trace the stone causeways that led up to the
  1407	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\truined gates where the last splinters of wood hung to the worn, rusted
  1408	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thinges. Trees had grown into and out of the walls; the battlements were
  1409	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttumbled down and decayed, and wild creepers hung out of the windows of
  1410	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe towers on the walls in bushy hanging clumps.
  1411	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1412	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tA great roofless palace crowned the hill, and the marble of the
  1413	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcourtyards and the fountains was split, and stained with red and green,
  1414	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand the very cobblestones in the courtyard where the king’s elephants
  1415	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tused to live had been thrust up and apart by grasses and young trees.
  1416	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tFrom the palace you could see the rows and rows of roofless houses that
  1417	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmade up the city looking like empty honeycombs filled with blackness;
  1418	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe shapeless block of stone that had been an idol in the square where
  1419	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfour roads met; the pits and dimples at street corners where the public
  1420	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twells once stood, and the shattered domes of temples with wild figs
  1421	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsprouting on their sides. The monkeys called the place their city, and
  1422	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tpretended to despise the Jungle-People because they lived in the forest.
  1423	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tAnd yet they never knew what the buildings were made for nor how to
  1424	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tuse them. They would sit in circles on the hall of the king’s council
  1425	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tchamber, and scratch for fleas and pretend to be men; or they would run
  1426	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tin and out of the roofless houses and collect pieces of plaster and old
  1427	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbricks in a corner, and forget where they had hidden them, and fight
  1428	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand cry in scuffling crowds, and then break off to play up and down the
  1429	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tterraces of the king’s garden, where they would shake the rose trees and
  1430	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe oranges in sport to see the fruit and flowers fall. They explored
  1431	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tall the passages and dark tunnels in the palace and the hundreds of
  1432	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlittle dark rooms, but they never remembered what they had seen and what
  1433	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthey had not; and so drifted about in ones and twos or crowds telling
  1434	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\teach other that they were doing as men did. They drank at the tanks and
  1435	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmade the water all muddy, and then they fought over it, and then they
  1436	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twould all rush together in mobs and shout: “There is no one in the
  1437	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tjungle so wise and good and clever and strong and gentle as the
  1438	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBandar-log.” Then all would begin again till they grew tired of the city
  1439	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand went back to the tree-tops, hoping the Jungle-People would notice

  1441	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1442	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMowgli, who had been trained under the Law of the Jungle, did not like
  1443	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tor understand this kind of life. The monkeys dragged him into the Cold
  1444	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tLairs late in the afternoon, and instead of going to sleep, as Mowgli
  1445	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twould have done after a long journey, they joined hands and danced about
  1446	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand sang their foolish songs. One of the monkeys made a speech and told
  1447	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\this companions that Mowgli’s capture marked a new thing in the history
  1448	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof the Bandar-log, for Mowgli was going to show them how to weave sticks
  1449	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand canes together as a protection against rain and cold. Mowgli picked
  1450	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tup some creepers and began to work them in and out, and the monkeys
  1451	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttried to imitate; but in a very few minutes they lost interest and began
  1452	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto pull their friends’ tails or jump up and down on all fours, coughing.
  1453	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1454	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I wish to eat,” said Mowgli. “I am a stranger in this part of the
  1455	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tjungle. Bring me food, or give me leave to hunt here.”
  1456	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1457	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tTwenty or thirty monkeys bounded away to bring him nuts and wild
  1458	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tpawpaws. But they fell to fighting on the road, and it was too much
  1459	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttrouble to go back with what was left of the fruit. Mowgli was sore and
  1460	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tangry as well as hungry, and he roamed through the empty city giving the
  1461	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tStrangers’ Hunting Call from time to time, but no one answered him, and
  1462	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMowgli felt that he had reached a very bad place indeed. “All that Baloo
  1463	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thas said about the Bandar-log is true,” he thought to himself. “They
  1464	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thave no Law, no Hunting Call, and no leaders--nothing but foolish words
  1465	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand little picking thievish hands. So if I am starved or killed here,
  1466	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tit will be all my own fault. But I must try to return to my own jungle.
  1467	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBaloo will surely beat me, but that is better than chasing silly rose
  1468	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tleaves with the Bandar-log.”
  1469	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1470	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tNo sooner had he walked to the city wall than the monkeys pulled him
  1471	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tback, telling him that he did not know how happy he was, and pinching
  1472	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thim to make him grateful. He set his teeth and said nothing, but
  1473	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twent with the shouting monkeys to a terrace above the red sandstone
  1474	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\treservoirs that were half-full of rain water. There was a ruined
  1475	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsummer-house of white marble in the center of the terrace, built for
  1476	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tqueens dead a hundred years ago. The domed roof had half fallen in and
  1477	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tblocked up the underground passage from the palace by which the
  1478	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tqueens used to enter. But the walls were made of screens of marble
  1479	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttracery--beautiful milk-white fretwork, set with agates and cornelians
  1480	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand jasper and lapis lazuli, and as the moon came up behind the hill it
  1481	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tshone through the open work, casting shadows on the ground like black
  1482	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tvelvet embroidery. Sore, sleepy, and hungry as he was, Mowgli could not
  1483	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thelp laughing when the Bandar-log began, twenty at a time, to tell him
  1484	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thow great and wise and strong and gentle they were, and how foolish he
  1485	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twas to wish to leave them. “We are great. We are free. We are wonderful.
  1486	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tWe are the most wonderful people in all the jungle! We all say so, and
  1487	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tso it must be true,” they shouted. “Now as you are a new listener and
  1488	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcan carry our words back to the Jungle-People so that they may notice us
  1489	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tin future, we will tell you all about our most excellent selves.” Mowgli
  1490	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmade no objection, and the monkeys gathered by hundreds and hundreds on
  1491	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe terrace to listen to their own speakers singing the praises of the
  1492	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBandar-log, and whenever a speaker stopped for want of breath they would
  1493	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tall shout together: “This is true; we all say so.” Mowgli nodded and
  1494	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tblinked, and said “Yes” when they asked him a question, and his head
  1495	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tspun with the noise. “Tabaqui the Jackal must have bitten all these
  1496	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tpeople,” he said to himself, “and now they have madness. Certainly this
  1497	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tis dewanee, the madness. Do they never go to sleep? Now there is a cloud
  1498	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcoming to cover that moon. If it were only a big enough cloud I might
  1499	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttry to run away in the darkness. But I am tired.”
  1500	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1501	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThat same cloud was being watched by two good friends in the ruined
  1502	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tditch below the city wall, for Bagheera and Kaa, knowing well how
  1503	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdangerous the Monkey-People were in large numbers, did not wish to run
  1504	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tany risks. The monkeys never fight unless they are a hundred to one, and
  1505	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfew in the jungle care for those odds.
  1506	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1507	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I will go to the west wall,” Kaa whispered, “and come down swiftly with
  1508	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe slope of the ground in my favor. They will not throw themselves upon
  1509	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmy back in their hundreds, but--”
  1510	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1511	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I know it,” said Bagheera. “Would that Baloo were here, but we must do
  1512	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twhat we can. When that cloud covers the moon I shall go to the terrace.
  1513	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThey hold some sort of council there over the boy.”
  1514	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1515	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Good hunting,” said Kaa grimly, and glided away to the west wall. That
  1516	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thappened to be the least ruined of any, and the big snake was delayed
  1517	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tawhile before he could find a way up the stones. The cloud hid the moon,
  1518	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand as Mowgli wondered what would come next he heard Bagheera’s light
  1519	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfeet on the terrace. The Black Panther had raced up the slope almost
  1520	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twithout a sound and was striking--he knew better than to waste time in
  1521	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbiting--right and left among the monkeys, who were seated round Mowgli
  1522	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tin circles fifty and sixty deep. There was a howl of fright and rage,
  1523	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand then as Bagheera tripped on the rolling kicking bodies beneath him,
  1524	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ta monkey shouted: “There is only one here! Kill him! Kill.” A scuffling
  1525	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmass of monkeys, biting, scratching, tearing, and pulling, closed over
  1526	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBagheera, while five or six laid hold of Mowgli, dragged him up the wall
  1527	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof the summerhouse and pushed him through the hole of the broken dome.
  1528	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tA man-trained boy would have been badly bruised, for the fall was a
  1529	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgood fifteen feet, but Mowgli fell as Baloo had taught him to fall, and
  1530	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlanded on his feet.
  1531	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1532	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Stay there,” shouted the monkeys, “till we have killed thy friends, and
  1533	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlater we will play with thee--if the Poison-People leave thee alive.”
  1534	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1535	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“We be of one blood, ye and I,” said Mowgli, quickly giving the Snake’s
  1536	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tCall. He could hear rustling and hissing in the rubbish all round him
  1537	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand gave the Call a second time, to make sure.
  1538	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1539	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Even ssso! Down hoods all!” said half a dozen low voices (every ruin
  1540	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tin India becomes sooner or later a dwelling place of snakes, and the old
  1541	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsummerhouse was alive with cobras). “Stand still, Little Brother, for
  1542	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthy feet may do us harm.”
  1543	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1544	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMowgli stood as quietly as he could, peering through the open work and
  1545	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlistening to the furious din of the fight round the Black Panther--the
  1546	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tyells and chatterings and scufflings, and Bagheera’s deep, hoarse cough
  1547	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tas he backed and bucked and twisted and plunged under the heaps of his
  1548	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tenemies. For the first time since he was born, Bagheera was fighting for
  1549	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\this life.
  1550	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1551	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Baloo must be at hand; Bagheera would not have come alone,” Mowgli
  1552	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthought. And then he called aloud: “To the tank, Bagheera. Roll to the
  1553	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twater tanks. Roll and plunge! Get to the water!”
  1554	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1555	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBagheera heard, and the cry that told him Mowgli was safe gave him new
  1556	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcourage. He worked his way desperately, inch by inch, straight for the
  1557	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\treservoirs, halting in silence. Then from the ruined wall nearest the
  1558	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tjungle rose up the rumbling war-shout of Baloo. The old Bear had done
  1559	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\this best, but he could not come before. “Bagheera,” he shouted, “I am
  1560	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\there. I climb! I haste! Ahuwora! The stones slip under my feet! Wait my
  1561	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcoming, O most infamous Bandar-log!” He panted up the terrace only
  1562	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto disappear to the head in a wave of monkeys, but he threw himself
  1563	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsquarely on his haunches, and, spreading out his forepaws, hugged as
  1564	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmany as he could hold, and then began to hit with a regular bat-bat-bat,
  1565	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlike the flipping strokes of a paddle wheel. A crash and a splash told
  1566	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMowgli that Bagheera had fought his way to the tank where the monkeys
  1567	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcould not follow. The Panther lay gasping for breath, his head just
  1568	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tout of the water, while the monkeys stood three deep on the red steps,
  1569	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdancing up and down with rage, ready to spring upon him from all sides
  1570	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tif he came out to help Baloo. It was then that Bagheera lifted up his
  1571	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdripping chin, and in despair gave the Snake’s Call for protection--“We
  1572	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbe of one blood, ye and I”--for he believed that Kaa had turned tail
  1573	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tat the last minute. Even Baloo, half smothered under the monkeys on
  1574	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe edge of the terrace, could not help chuckling as he heard the Black
  1575	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tPanther asking for help.
  1576	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1577	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tKaa had only just worked his way over the west wall, landing with a
  1578	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twrench that dislodged a coping stone into the ditch. He had no intention
  1579	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof losing any advantage of the ground, and coiled and uncoiled himself
  1580	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tonce or twice, to be sure that every foot of his long body was in
  1581	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tworking order. All that while the fight with Baloo went on, and the
  1582	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmonkeys yelled in the tank round Bagheera, and Mang the Bat, flying to
  1583	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand fro, carried the news of the great battle over the jungle, till even
  1584	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tHathi the Wild Elephant trumpeted, and, far away, scattered bands of
  1585	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe Monkey-Folk woke and came leaping along the tree-roads to help their
  1586	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcomrades in the Cold Lairs, and the noise of the fight roused all the
  1587	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tday birds for miles round. Then Kaa came straight, quickly, and anxious
  1588	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto kill. The fighting strength of a python is in the driving blow of
  1589	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\this head backed by all the strength and weight of his body. If you can
  1590	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\timagine a lance, or a battering ram, or a hammer weighing nearly half
  1591	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ta ton driven by a cool, quiet mind living in the handle of it, you can
  1592	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\troughly imagine what Kaa was like when he fought. A python four or five
  1593	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfeet long can knock a man down if he hits him fairly in the chest, and
  1594	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tKaa was thirty feet long, as you know. His first stroke was delivered
  1595	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tinto the heart of the crowd round Baloo. It was sent home with shut
  1596	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmouth in silence, and there was no need of a second. The monkeys
  1597	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tscattered with cries of--“Kaa! It is Kaa! Run! Run!”
  1598	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1599	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tGenerations of monkeys had been scared into good behavior by the stories
  1600	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttheir elders told them of Kaa, the night thief, who could slip along the
  1601	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbranches as quietly as moss grows, and steal away the strongest monkey
  1602	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthat ever lived; of old Kaa, who could make himself look so like a dead
  1603	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbranch or a rotten stump that the wisest were deceived, till the branch
  1604	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcaught them. Kaa was everything that the monkeys feared in the jungle,
  1605	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfor none of them knew the limits of his power, none of them could look
  1606	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thim in the face, and none had ever come alive out of his hug. And so
  1607	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthey ran, stammering with terror, to the walls and the roofs of the
  1608	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thouses, and Baloo drew a deep breath of relief. His fur was much thicker
  1609	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthan Bagheera’s, but he had suffered sorely in the fight. Then Kaa
  1610	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\topened his mouth for the first time and spoke one long hissing word, and
  1611	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe far-away monkeys, hurrying to the defense of the Cold Lairs, stayed
  1612	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twhere they were, cowering, till the loaded branches bent and crackled
  1613	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tunder them. The monkeys on the walls and the empty houses stopped
  1614	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttheir cries, and in the stillness that fell upon the city Mowgli heard
  1615	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBagheera shaking his wet sides as he came up from the tank. Then the
  1616	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tclamor broke out again. The monkeys leaped higher up the walls. They
  1617	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tclung around the necks of the big stone idols and shrieked as they
  1618	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tskipped along the battlements, while Mowgli, dancing in the summerhouse,
  1619	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tput his eye to the screenwork and hooted owl-fashion between his front
  1620	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tteeth, to show his derision and contempt.
  1621	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1622	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Get the man-cub out of that trap; I can do no more,” Bagheera gasped.
  1623	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Let us take the man-cub and go. They may attack again.”
  1624	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1625	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“They will not move till I order them. Stay you sssso!” Kaa hissed, and
  1626	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe city was silent once more. “I could not come before, Brother, but I
  1627	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthink I heard thee call”--this was to Bagheera.
  1628	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1629	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I--I may have cried out in the battle,” Bagheera answered. “Baloo, art
  1630	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthou hurt?
  1631	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1632	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I am not sure that they did not pull me into a hundred little
  1633	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbearlings,” said Baloo, gravely shaking one leg after the other. “Wow! I
  1634	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tam sore. Kaa, we owe thee, I think, our lives--Bagheera and I.”
  1635	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1636	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“No matter. Where is the manling?”
  1637	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1638	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Here, in a trap. I cannot climb out,” cried Mowgli. The curve of the
  1639	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbroken dome was above his head.
  1640	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1641	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Take him away. He dances like Mao the Peacock. He will crush our
  1642	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tyoung,” said the cobras inside.
  1643	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1644	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Hah!” said Kaa with a chuckle, “he has friends everywhere, this
  1645	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmanling. Stand back, manling. And hide you, O Poison People. I break
  1646	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdown the wall.”
  1647	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1648	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tKaa looked carefully till he found a discolored crack in the marble
  1649	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttracery showing a weak spot, made two or three light taps with his head
  1650	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto get the distance, and then lifting up six feet of his body clear
  1651	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof the ground, sent home half a dozen full-power smashing blows,
  1652	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnose-first. The screen-work broke and fell away in a cloud of dust and
  1653	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\trubbish, and Mowgli leaped through the opening and flung himself between
  1654	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBaloo and Bagheera--an arm around each big neck.
  1655	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1656	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Art thou hurt?” said Baloo, hugging him softly.
  1657	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1658	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I am sore, hungry, and not a little bruised. But, oh, they have handled
  1659	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tye grievously, my Brothers! Ye bleed.”
  1660	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1661	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Others also,” said Bagheera, licking his lips and looking at the
  1662	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmonkey-dead on the terrace and round the tank.
  1663	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1664	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“It is nothing, it is nothing, if thou art safe, oh, my pride of all
  1665	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlittle frogs!” whimpered Baloo.
  1666	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1667	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Of that we shall judge later,” said Bagheera, in a dry voice that
  1668	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMowgli did not at all like. “But here is Kaa to whom we owe the battle
  1669	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand thou owest thy life. Thank him according to our customs, Mowgli.”
  1670	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1671	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMowgli turned and saw the great Python’s head swaying a foot above his
  1672	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\town.
  1673	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1674	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“So this is the manling,” said Kaa. “Very soft is his skin, and he is
  1675	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnot unlike the Bandar-log. Have a care, manling, that I do not mistake
  1676	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthee for a monkey some twilight when I have newly changed my coat.”
  1677	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1678	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“We be one blood, thou and I,” Mowgli answered. “I take my life from
  1679	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthee tonight. My kill shall be thy kill if ever thou art hungry, O Kaa.”
  1680	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1681	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“All thanks, Little Brother,” said Kaa, though his eyes twinkled. “And
  1682	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twhat may so bold a hunter kill? I ask that I may follow when next he
  1683	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgoes abroad.”
  1684	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1685	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I kill nothing,--I am too little,--but I drive goats toward such as can
  1686	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tuse them. When thou art empty come to me and see if I speak the truth.
  1687	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tI have some skill in these [he held out his hands], and if ever thou art
  1688	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tin a trap, I may pay the debt which I owe to thee, to Bagheera, and to
  1689	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBaloo, here. Good hunting to ye all, my masters.”
  1690	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1691	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Well said,” growled Baloo, for Mowgli had returned thanks very
  1692	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tprettily. The Python dropped his head lightly for a minute on Mowgli’s
  1693	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tshoulder. “A brave heart and a courteous tongue,” said he. “They shall
  1694	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcarry thee far through the jungle, manling. But now go hence quickly
  1695	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twith thy friends. Go and sleep, for the moon sets, and what follows it
  1696	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tis not well that thou shouldst see.”
  1697	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1698	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe moon was sinking behind the hills and the lines of trembling monkeys
  1699	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thuddled together on the walls and battlements looked like ragged shaky
  1700	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfringes of things. Baloo went down to the tank for a drink and Bagheera
  1701	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbegan to put his fur in order, as Kaa glided out into the center of the
  1702	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tterrace and brought his jaws together with a ringing snap that drew all
  1703	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe monkeys’ eyes upon him.
  1704	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1705	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“The moon sets,” he said. “Is there yet light enough to see?”
  1706	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1707	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tFrom the walls came a moan like the wind in the tree-tops--“We see, O
  1708	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tKaa.”
  1709	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1710	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Good. Begins now the dance--the Dance of the Hunger of Kaa. Sit still
  1711	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand watch.”
  1712	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1713	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tHe turned twice or thrice in a big circle, weaving his head from right
  1714	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto left. Then he began making loops and figures of eight with his
  1715	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbody, and soft, oozy triangles that melted into squares and five-sided
  1716	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfigures, and coiled mounds, never resting, never hurrying, and never
  1717	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tstopping his low humming song. It grew darker and darker, till at last
  1718	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe dragging, shifting coils disappeared, but they could hear the rustle
  1719	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof the scales.
  1720	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1721	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBaloo and Bagheera stood still as stone, growling in their throats,
  1722	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttheir neck hair bristling, and Mowgli watched and wondered.
  1723	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1724	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Bandar-log,” said the voice of Kaa at last, “can ye stir foot or hand
  1725	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twithout my order? Speak!”
  1726	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1727	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Without thy order we cannot stir foot or hand, O Kaa!”
  1728	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1729	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Good! Come all one pace nearer to me.”
  1730	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1731	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe lines of the monkeys swayed forward helplessly, and Baloo and
  1732	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBagheera took one stiff step forward with them.
  1733	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1734	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Nearer!” hissed Kaa, and they all moved again.
  1735	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1736	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMowgli laid his hands on Baloo and Bagheera to get them away, and the
  1737	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttwo great beasts started as though they had been waked from a dream.
  1738	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1739	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Keep thy hand on my shoulder,” Bagheera whispered. “Keep it there, or I
  1740	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmust go back--must go back to Kaa. Aah!”
  1741	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1742	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“It is only old Kaa making circles on the dust,” said Mowgli. “Let us
  1743	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgo.” And the three slipped off through a gap in the walls to the jungle.
  1744	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1745	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Whoof!” said Baloo, when he stood under the still trees again. “Never
  1746	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmore will I make an ally of Kaa,” and he shook himself all over.
  1747	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1748	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“He knows more than we,” said Bagheera, trembling. “In a little time,
  1749	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thad I stayed, I should have walked down his throat.”
  1750	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1751	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Many will walk by that road before the moon rises again,” said Baloo.
  1752	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“He will have good hunting--after his own fashion.”
  1753	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1754	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“But what was the meaning of it all?” said Mowgli, who did not know
  1755	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tanything of a python’s powers of fascination. “I saw no more than a big
  1756	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsnake making foolish circles till the dark came. And his nose was all
  1757	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsore. Ho! Ho!”
  1758	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1759	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Mowgli,” said Bagheera angrily, “his nose was sore on thy account, as
  1760	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmy ears and sides and paws, and Baloo’s neck and shoulders are bitten
  1761	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ton thy account. Neither Baloo nor Bagheera will be able to hunt with
  1762	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tpleasure for many days.”
  1763	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1764	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“It is nothing,” said Baloo; “we have the man-cub again.”
  1765	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1766	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“True, but he has cost us heavily in time which might have been spent in
  1767	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgood hunting, in wounds, in hair--I am half plucked along my back--and
  1768	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlast of all, in honor. For, remember, Mowgli, I, who am the Black
  1769	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tPanther, was forced to call upon Kaa for protection, and Baloo and I
  1770	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twere both made stupid as little birds by the Hunger Dance. All this,
  1771	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tman-cub, came of thy playing with the Bandar-log.”
  1772	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1773	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“True, it is true,” said Mowgli sorrowfully. “I am an evil man-cub, and
  1774	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmy stomach is sad in me.”
  1775	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1776	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Mf! What says the Law of the Jungle, Baloo?”
  1777	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1778	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBaloo did not wish to bring Mowgli into any more trouble, but he could
  1779	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnot tamper with the Law, so he mumbled: “Sorrow never stays punishment.
  1780	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBut remember, Bagheera, he is very little.”
  1781	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1782	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I will remember. But he has done mischief, and blows must be dealt now.
  1783	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMowgli, hast thou anything to say?”
  1784	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1785	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Nothing. I did wrong. Baloo and thou are wounded. It is just.”
  1786	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1787	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBagheera gave him half a dozen love-taps from a panther’s point of
  1788	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tview (they would hardly have waked one of his own cubs), but for a
  1789	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tseven-year-old boy they amounted to as severe a beating as you could
  1790	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twish to avoid. When it was all over Mowgli sneezed, and picked himself
  1791	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tup without a word.
  1792	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1793	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Now,” said Bagheera, “jump on my back, Little Brother, and we will go
  1794	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thome.”
  1795	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1796	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tOne of the beauties of Jungle Law is that punishment settles all scores.
  1797	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThere is no nagging afterward.
  1798	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1799	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMowgli laid his head down on Bagheera’s back and slept so deeply that he
  1800	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnever waked when he was put down in the home-cave.
  1801	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t

  1806	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1807	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     Here we go in a flung festoon,
  1808	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     Half-way up to the jealous moon!
  1809	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     Don’t you envy our pranceful bands?
  1810	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     Don’t you wish you had extra hands?
  1811	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     Wouldn’t you like if your tails were--so--
  1812	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     Curved in the shape of a Cupid’s bow?
  1813	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t        Now you’re angry, but--never mind,
  1814	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t        Brother, thy tail hangs down behind!
  1815	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1816	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     Here we sit in a branchy row,
  1817	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     Thinking of beautiful things we know;
  1818	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     Dreaming of deeds that we mean to do,
  1819	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     All complete, in a minute or two--
  1820	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     Something noble and wise and good,
  1821	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     Done by merely wishing we could.
  1822	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t        We’ve forgotten, but--never mind,
  1823	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t        Brother, thy tail hangs down behind!
  1824	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1825	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     All the talk we ever have heard
  1826	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     Uttered by bat or beast or bird--
  1827	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     Hide or fin or scale or feather--
  1828	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     Jabber it quickly and all together!
  1829	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     Excellent!  Wonderful!  Once again!
  1830	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1831	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     Now we are talking just like men!
  1832	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t        Let’s pretend we are ... never mind,
  1833	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t        Brother, thy tail hangs down behind!
  1834	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t        This is the way of the Monkey-kind.
  1835	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1836	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     Then join our leaping lines that scumfish through the pines,
  1837	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     That rocket by where, light and high, the wild grape swings.
  1838	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     By the rubbish in our wake, and the noble noise we make,
  1839	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     Be sure, be sure, we’re going to do some splendid things!
  1840	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1841	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1842	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1843	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1844	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Tiger! Tiger!”
  1845	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1846	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     What of the hunting, hunter bold?
  1847	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t        Brother, the watch was long and cold.
  1848	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     What of the quarry ye went to kill?
  1849	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t        Brother, he crops in the jungle still.
  1850	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     Where is the power that made your pride?
  1851	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t        Brother, it ebbs from my flank and side.
  1852	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     Where is the haste that ye hurry by?
  1853	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t        Brother, I go to my lair--to die.
  1854	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1855	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tNow we must go back to the first tale. When Mowgli left the wolf’s cave
  1856	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tafter the fight with the Pack at the Council Rock, he went down to the
  1857	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tplowed lands where the villagers lived, but he would not stop there
  1858	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbecause it was too near to the jungle, and he knew that he had made at
  1859	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tleast one bad enemy at the Council. So he hurried on, keeping to
  1860	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe rough road that ran down the valley, and followed it at a steady
  1861	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tjog-trot for nearly twenty miles, till he came to a country that he
  1862	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdid not know. The valley opened out into a great plain dotted over with
  1863	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\trocks and cut up by ravines. At one end stood a little village, and at
  1864	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe other the thick jungle came down in a sweep to the grazing-grounds,
  1865	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand stopped there as though it had been cut off with a hoe. All over the
  1866	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tplain, cattle and buffaloes were grazing, and when the little boys in
  1867	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcharge of the herds saw Mowgli they shouted and ran away, and the yellow
  1868	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tpariah dogs that hang about every Indian village barked. Mowgli walked
  1869	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ton, for he was feeling hungry, and when he came to the village gate he
  1870	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsaw the big thorn-bush that was drawn up before the gate at twilight,
  1871	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tpushed to one side.
  1872	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1873	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Umph!” he said, for he had come across more than one such barricade in
  1874	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\this night rambles after things to eat. “So men are afraid of the People
  1875	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof the Jungle here also.” He sat down by the gate, and when a man came
  1876	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tout he stood up, opened his mouth, and pointed down it to show that
  1877	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\the wanted food. The man stared, and ran back up the one street of the
  1878	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tvillage shouting for the priest, who was a big, fat man dressed in
  1879	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twhite, with a red and yellow mark on his forehead. The priest came to
  1880	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe gate, and with him at least a hundred people, who stared and talked
  1881	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand shouted and pointed at Mowgli.
  1882	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1883	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“They have no manners, these Men Folk,” said Mowgli to himself. “Only
  1884	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe gray ape would behave as they do.” So he threw back his long hair
  1885	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand frowned at the crowd.
  1886	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1887	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“What is there to be afraid of?” said the priest. “Look at the marks on
  1888	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\this arms and legs. They are the bites of wolves. He is but a wolf-child
  1889	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\trun away from the jungle.”
  1890	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1891	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tOf course, in playing together, the cubs had often nipped Mowgli harder
  1892	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthan they intended, and there were white scars all over his arms and
  1893	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlegs. But he would have been the last person in the world to call these
  1894	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbites, for he knew what real biting meant.
  1895	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1896	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Arre! Arre!” said two or three women together. “To be bitten by wolves,
  1897	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tpoor child! He is a handsome boy. He has eyes like red fire. By my
  1898	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thonor, Messua, he is not unlike thy boy that was taken by the tiger.”
  1899	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1900	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Let me look,” said a woman with heavy copper rings on her wrists and
  1901	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tankles, and she peered at Mowgli under the palm of her hand. “Indeed he
  1902	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tis not. He is thinner, but he has the very look of my boy.”
  1903	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1904	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe priest was a clever man, and he knew that Messua was wife to the
  1905	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\trichest villager in the place. So he looked up at the sky for a minute
  1906	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand said solemnly: “What the jungle has taken the jungle has restored.
  1907	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tTake the boy into thy house, my sister, and forget not to honor the
  1908	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tpriest who sees so far into the lives of men.”
  1909	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1910	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“By the Bull that bought me,” said Mowgli to himself, “but all this
  1911	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttalking is like another looking-over by the Pack! Well, if I am a man, a
  1912	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tman I must become.”
  1913	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1914	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe crowd parted as the woman beckoned Mowgli to her hut, where there
  1915	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twas a red lacquered bedstead, a great earthen grain chest with funny
  1916	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\traised patterns on it, half a dozen copper cooking pots, an image of a
  1917	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tHindu god in a little alcove, and on the wall a real looking glass, such
  1918	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tas they sell at the country fairs.
  1919	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1920	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tShe gave him a long drink of milk and some bread, and then she laid her
  1921	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thand on his head and looked into his eyes; for she thought perhaps that
  1922	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\the might be her real son come back from the jungle where the tiger had
  1923	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttaken him. So she said, “Nathoo, O Nathoo!” Mowgli did not show that he
  1924	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tknew the name. “Dost thou not remember the day when I gave thee thy new
  1925	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tshoes?” She touched his foot, and it was almost as hard as horn. “No,”
  1926	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t she said sorrowfully, “those feet have never worn shoes, but thou art
  1927	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tvery like my Nathoo, and thou shalt be my son.”
  1928	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1929	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMowgli was uneasy, because he had never been under a roof before. But as
  1930	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\the looked at the thatch, he saw that he could tear it out any time if he
  1931	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twanted to get away, and that the window had no fastenings. “What is the
  1932	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgood of a man,” he said to himself at last, “if he does not understand
  1933	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tman’s talk? Now I am as silly and dumb as a man would be with us in the
  1934	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tjungle. I must speak their talk.”
  1935	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1936	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tIt was not for fun that he had learned while he was with the wolves to
  1937	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\timitate the challenge of bucks in the jungle and the grunt of the little
  1938	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twild pig. So, as soon as Messua pronounced a word Mowgli would imitate
  1939	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tit almost perfectly, and before dark he had learned the names of many
  1940	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthings in the hut.
  1941	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1942	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThere was a difficulty at bedtime, because Mowgli would not sleep under
  1943	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tanything that looked so like a panther trap as that hut, and when they
  1944	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tshut the door he went through the window. “Give him his will,” said
  1945	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMessua’s husband. “Remember he can never till now have slept on a bed.
  1946	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tIf he is indeed sent in the place of our son he will not run away.”
  1947	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1948	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tSo Mowgli stretched himself in some long, clean grass at the edge of
  1949	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe field, but before he had closed his eyes a soft gray nose poked him
  1950	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tunder the chin.
  1951	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1952	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Phew!” said Gray Brother (he was the eldest of Mother Wolf’s cubs).
  1953	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“This is a poor reward for following thee twenty miles. Thou smellest
  1954	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof wood smoke and cattle--altogether like a man already. Wake, Little
  1955	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBrother; I bring news.”
  1956	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1957	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Are all well in the jungle?” said Mowgli, hugging him.
  1958	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1959	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“All except the wolves that were burned with the Red Flower. Now,
  1960	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlisten. Shere Khan has gone away to hunt far off till his coat grows
  1961	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tagain, for he is badly singed. When he returns he swears that he will
  1962	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlay thy bones in the Waingunga.”
  1963	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1964	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“There are two words to that. I also have made a little promise. But
  1965	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnews is always good. I am tired to-night,--very tired with new things,
  1966	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tGray Brother,--but bring me the news always.”
  1967	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1968	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Thou wilt not forget that thou art a wolf? Men will not make thee
  1969	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tforget?” said Gray Brother anxiously.
  1970	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1971	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Never. I will always remember that I love thee and all in our cave. But
  1972	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\talso I will always remember that I have been cast out of the Pack.”
  1973	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1974	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“And that thou mayest be cast out of another pack. Men are only men,
  1975	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tLittle Brother, and their talk is like the talk of frogs in a pond. When
  1976	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tI come down here again, I will wait for thee in the bamboos at the edge
  1977	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof the grazing-ground.”
  1978	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1979	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tFor three months after that night Mowgli hardly ever left the village
  1980	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgate, he was so busy learning the ways and customs of men. First he had
  1981	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto wear a cloth round him, which annoyed him horribly; and then he had
  1982	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto learn about money, which he did not in the least understand, and
  1983	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tabout plowing, of which he did not see the use. Then the little children
  1984	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tin the village made him very angry. Luckily, the Law of the Jungle had
  1985	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttaught him to keep his temper, for in the jungle life and food depend on
  1986	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tkeeping your temper; but when they made fun of him because he would not
  1987	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tplay games or fly kites, or because he mispronounced some word, only the
  1988	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tknowledge that it was unsportsmanlike to kill little naked cubs kept him
  1989	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfrom picking them up and breaking them in two.
  1990	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1991	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tHe did not know his own strength in the least. In the jungle he knew he
  1992	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twas weak compared with the beasts, but in the village people said that
  1993	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\the was as strong as a bull.
  1994	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  1995	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tAnd Mowgli had not the faintest idea of the difference that caste makes
  1996	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbetween man and man. When the potter’s donkey slipped in the clay pit,
  1997	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMowgli hauled it out by the tail, and helped to stack the pots for their
  1998	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tjourney to the market at Khanhiwara. That was very shocking, too, for
  1999	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe potter is a low-caste man, and his donkey is worse. When the priest
  2000	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tscolded him, Mowgli threatened to put him on the donkey too, and the
  2001	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tpriest told Messua’s husband that Mowgli had better be set to work as
  2002	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsoon as possible; and the village head-man told Mowgli that he would
  2003	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thave to go out with the buffaloes next day, and herd them while they
  2004	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgrazed. No one was more pleased than Mowgli; and that night, because he
  2005	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thad been appointed a servant of the village, as it were, he went off
  2006	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto a circle that met every evening on a masonry platform under a great
  2007	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfig-tree. It was the village club, and the head-man and the watchman and
  2008	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe barber, who knew all the gossip of the village, and old Buldeo, the
  2009	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tvillage hunter, who had a Tower musket, met and smoked. The monkeys
  2010	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsat and talked in the upper branches, and there was a hole under the
  2011	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tplatform where a cobra lived, and he had his little platter of milk
  2012	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tevery night because he was sacred; and the old men sat around the tree
  2013	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand talked, and pulled at the big huqas (the water-pipes) till far into
  2014	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe night. They told wonderful tales of gods and men and ghosts; and
  2015	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBuldeo told even more wonderful ones of the ways of beasts in the
  2016	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tjungle, till the eyes of the children sitting outside the circle bulged
  2017	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tout of their heads. Most of the tales were about animals, for the jungle
  2018	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twas always at their door. The deer and the wild pig grubbed up their
  2019	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcrops, and now and again the tiger carried off a man at twilight, within
  2020	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsight of the village gates.
  2021	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2022	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMowgli, who naturally knew something about what they were talking of,
  2023	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thad to cover his face not to show that he was laughing, while Buldeo,
  2024	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe Tower musket across his knees, climbed on from one wonderful story
  2025	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto another, and Mowgli’s shoulders shook.
  2026	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2027	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBuldeo was explaining how the tiger that had carried away Messua’s son
  2028	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twas a ghost-tiger, and his body was inhabited by the ghost of a wicked,
  2029	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\told money-lender, who had died some years ago. “And I know that this is
  2030	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttrue,” he said, “because Purun Dass always limped from the blow that he
  2031	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgot in a riot when his account books were burned, and the tiger that I
  2032	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tspeak of he limps, too, for the tracks of his pads are unequal.”
  2033	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2034	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“True, true, that must be the truth,” said the gray-beards, nodding
  2035	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttogether.
  2036	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2037	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Are all these tales such cobwebs and moon talk?” said Mowgli. “That
  2038	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttiger limps because he was born lame, as everyone knows. To talk of the
  2039	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsoul of a money-lender in a beast that never had the courage of a jackal
  2040	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tis child’s talk.”
  2041	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2042	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBuldeo was speechless with surprise for a moment, and the head-man
  2043	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tstared.
  2044	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2045	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Oho! It is the jungle brat, is it?” said Buldeo. “If thou art so
  2046	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twise, better bring his hide to Khanhiwara, for the Government has set
  2047	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ta hundred rupees on his life. Better still, talk not when thy elders
  2048	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tspeak.”
  2049	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2050	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMowgli rose to go. “All the evening I have lain here listening,” he
  2051	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcalled back over his shoulder, “and, except once or twice, Buldeo has
  2052	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnot said one word of truth concerning the jungle, which is at his very
  2053	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdoors. How, then, shall I believe the tales of ghosts and gods and
  2054	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgoblins which he says he has seen?”
  2055	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2056	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“It is full time that boy went to herding,” said the head-man, while
  2057	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBuldeo puffed and snorted at Mowgli’s impertinence.
  2058	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2059	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe custom of most Indian villages is for a few boys to take the cattle
  2060	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand buffaloes out to graze in the early morning, and bring them back
  2061	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tat night. The very cattle that would trample a white man to death allow
  2062	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthemselves to be banged and bullied and shouted at by children that
  2063	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thardly come up to their noses. So long as the boys keep with the herds
  2064	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthey are safe, for not even the tiger will charge a mob of cattle. But
  2065	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tif they straggle to pick flowers or hunt lizards, they are sometimes
  2066	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcarried off. Mowgli went through the village street in the dawn, sitting
  2067	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ton the back of Rama, the great herd bull. The slaty-blue buffaloes,
  2068	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twith their long, backward-sweeping horns and savage eyes, rose out their
  2069	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbyres, one by one, and followed him, and Mowgli made it very clear to
  2070	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe children with him that he was the master. He beat the buffaloes with
  2071	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ta long, polished bamboo, and told Kamya, one of the boys, to graze the
  2072	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcattle by themselves, while he went on with the buffaloes, and to be
  2073	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tvery careful not to stray away from the herd.
  2074	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2075	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tAn Indian grazing ground is all rocks and scrub and tussocks and little
  2076	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\travines, among which the herds scatter and disappear. The buffaloes
  2077	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgenerally keep to the pools and muddy places, where they lie wallowing
  2078	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tor basking in the warm mud for hours. Mowgli drove them on to the edge
  2079	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof the plain where the Waingunga came out of the jungle; then he dropped
  2080	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfrom Rama’s neck, trotted off to a bamboo clump, and found Gray Brother.
  2081	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Ah,” said Gray Brother, “I have waited here very many days. What is the
  2082	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmeaning of this cattle-herding work?”
  2083	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2084	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“It is an order,” said Mowgli. “I am a village herd for a while. What
  2085	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnews of Shere Khan?”
  2086	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2087	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“He has come back to this country, and has waited here a long time for
  2088	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthee. Now he has gone off again, for the game is scarce. But he means to
  2089	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tkill thee.”
  2090	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2091	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Very good,” said Mowgli. “So long as he is away do thou or one of the
  2092	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfour brothers sit on that rock, so that I can see thee as I come out of
  2093	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe village. When he comes back wait for me in the ravine by the dhak
  2094	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttree in the center of the plain. We need not walk into Shere Khan’s
  2095	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmouth.”
  2096	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2097	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThen Mowgli picked out a shady place, and lay down and slept while
  2098	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe buffaloes grazed round him. Herding in India is one of the laziest
  2099	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthings in the world. The cattle move and crunch, and lie down, and move
  2100	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ton again, and they do not even low. They only grunt, and the buffaloes
  2101	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tvery seldom say anything, but get down into the muddy pools one after
  2102	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tanother, and work their way into the mud till only their noses and
  2103	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tstaring china-blue eyes show above the surface, and then they lie like
  2104	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlogs. The sun makes the rocks dance in the heat, and the herd children
  2105	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thear one kite (never any more) whistling almost out of sight overhead,
  2106	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand they know that if they died, or a cow died, that kite would sweep
  2107	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdown, and the next kite miles away would see him drop and follow, and
  2108	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe next, and the next, and almost before they were dead there would be
  2109	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ta score of hungry kites come out of nowhere. Then they sleep and
  2110	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twake and sleep again, and weave little baskets of dried grass and put
  2111	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgrasshoppers in them; or catch two praying mantises and make them fight;
  2112	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tor string a necklace of red and black jungle nuts; or watch a lizard
  2113	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbasking on a rock, or a snake hunting a frog near the wallows. Then they
  2114	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsing long, long songs with odd native quavers at the end of them, and
  2115	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe day seems longer than most people’s whole lives, and perhaps they
  2116	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmake a mud castle with mud figures of men and horses and buffaloes, and
  2117	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tput reeds into the men’s hands, and pretend that they are kings and the
  2118	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfigures are their armies, or that they are gods to be worshiped. Then
  2119	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tevening comes and the children call, and the buffaloes lumber up out of
  2120	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe sticky mud with noises like gunshots going off one after the other,
  2121	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand they all string across the gray plain back to the twinkling village
  2122	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlights.
  2123	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2124	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tDay after day Mowgli would lead the buffaloes out to their wallows, and
  2125	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tday after day he would see Gray Brother’s back a mile and a half away
  2126	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tacross the plain (so he knew that Shere Khan had not come back), and day
  2127	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tafter day he would lie on the grass listening to the noises round him,
  2128	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand dreaming of old days in the jungle. If Shere Khan had made a false
  2129	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tstep with his lame paw up in the jungles by the Waingunga, Mowgli would
  2130	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thave heard him in those long, still mornings.
  2131	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2132	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tAt last a day came when he did not see Gray Brother at the signal place,
  2133	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand he laughed and headed the buffaloes for the ravine by the dhk tree,
  2134	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twhich was all covered with golden-red flowers. There sat Gray Brother,
  2135	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tevery bristle on his back lifted.
  2136	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2137	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“He has hidden for a month to throw thee off thy guard. He crossed the
  2138	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tranges last night with Tabaqui, hot-foot on thy trail,” said the Wolf,
  2139	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tpanting.
  2140	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2141	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMowgli frowned. “I am not afraid of Shere Khan, but Tabaqui is very
  2142	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcunning.”
  2143	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2144	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Have no fear,” said Gray Brother, licking his lips a little. “I met
  2145	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tTabaqui in the dawn. Now he is telling all his wisdom to the kites, but
  2146	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\the told me everything before I broke his back. Shere Khan’s plan is to
  2147	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twait for thee at the village gate this evening--for thee and for no one
  2148	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\telse. He is lying up now, in the big dry ravine of the Waingunga.”
  2149	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2150	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Has he eaten today, or does he hunt empty?” said Mowgli, for the answer
  2151	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmeant life and death to him.
  2152	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2153	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“He killed at dawn,--a pig,--and he has drunk too. Remember, Shere Khan
  2154	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcould never fast, even for the sake of revenge.”
  2155	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2156	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Oh! Fool, fool! What a cub’s cub it is! Eaten and drunk too, and he
  2157	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthinks that I shall wait till he has slept! Now, where does he lie up?
  2158	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tIf there were but ten of us we might pull him down as he lies. These
  2159	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbuffaloes will not charge unless they wind him, and I cannot speak their
  2160	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlanguage. Can we get behind his track so that they may smell it?”
  2161	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2162	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“He swam far down the Waingunga to cut that off,” said Gray Brother.
  2163	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2164	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Tabaqui told him that, I know. He would never have thought of it
  2165	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\talone.” Mowgli stood with his finger in his mouth, thinking. “The big
  2166	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\travine of the Waingunga. That opens out on the plain not half a mile
  2167	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfrom here. I can take the herd round through the jungle to the head of
  2168	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe ravine and then sweep down--but he would slink out at the foot. We
  2169	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmust block that end. Gray Brother, canst thou cut the herd in two for
  2170	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tme?”
  2171	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2172	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Not I, perhaps--but I have brought a wise helper.” Gray Brother trotted
  2173	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\toff and dropped into a hole. Then there lifted up a huge gray head that
  2174	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMowgli knew well, and the hot air was filled with the most desolate cry
  2175	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof all the jungle--the hunting howl of a wolf at midday.
  2176	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2177	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Akela! Akela!” said Mowgli, clapping his hands. “I might have known
  2178	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthat thou wouldst not forget me. We have a big work in hand. Cut the
  2179	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\therd in two, Akela. Keep the cows and calves together, and the bulls and
  2180	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe plow buffaloes by themselves.”
  2181	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2182	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe two wolves ran, ladies’-chain fashion, in and out of the herd, which
  2183	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsnorted and threw up its head, and separated into two clumps. In one,
  2184	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe cow-buffaloes stood with their calves in the center, and glared
  2185	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand pawed, ready, if a wolf would only stay still, to charge down and
  2186	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttrample the life out of him. In the other, the bulls and the young bulls
  2187	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsnorted and stamped, but though they looked more imposing they were much
  2188	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tless dangerous, for they had no calves to protect. No six men could have
  2189	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdivided the herd so neatly.
  2190	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2191	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“What orders!” panted Akela. “They are trying to join again.”
  2192	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2193	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMowgli slipped on to Rama’s back. “Drive the bulls away to the left,
  2194	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tAkela. Gray Brother, when we are gone, hold the cows together, and drive
  2195	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthem into the foot of the ravine.”
  2196	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2197	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“How far?” said Gray Brother, panting and snapping.
  2198	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2199	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Till the sides are higher than Shere Khan can jump,” shouted Mowgli.
  2200	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Keep them there till we come down.” The bulls swept off as Akela bayed,
  2201	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand Gray Brother stopped in front of the cows. They charged down on him,
  2202	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand he ran just before them to the foot of the ravine, as Akela drove
  2203	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe bulls far to the left.
  2204	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2205	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Well done! Another charge and they are fairly started. Careful,
  2206	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnow--careful, Akela. A snap too much and the bulls will charge. Hujah!
  2207	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThis is wilder work than driving black-buck. Didst thou think these
  2208	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcreatures could move so swiftly?” Mowgli called.
  2209	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2210	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I have--have hunted these too in my time,” gasped Akela in the dust.
  2211	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Shall I turn them into the jungle?”
  2212	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2213	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Ay! Turn. Swiftly turn them! Rama is mad with rage. Oh, if I could only
  2214	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttell him what I need of him to-day.”
  2215	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2216	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe bulls were turned, to the right this time, and crashed into the
  2217	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tstanding thicket. The other herd children, watching with the cattle half
  2218	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ta mile away, hurried to the village as fast as their legs could carry
  2219	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthem, crying that the buffaloes had gone mad and run away.
  2220	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2221	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBut Mowgli’s plan was simple enough. All he wanted to do was to make a
  2222	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbig circle uphill and get at the head of the ravine, and then take the
  2223	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbulls down it and catch Shere Khan between the bulls and the cows; for
  2224	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\the knew that after a meal and a full drink Shere Khan would not be in
  2225	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tany condition to fight or to clamber up the sides of the ravine. He was
  2226	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsoothing the buffaloes now by voice, and Akela had dropped far to the
  2227	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\trear, only whimpering once or twice to hurry the rear-guard. It was a
  2228	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlong, long circle, for they did not wish to get too near the ravine and
  2229	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgive Shere Khan warning. At last Mowgli rounded up the bewildered herd
  2230	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tat the head of the ravine on a grassy patch that sloped steeply down to
  2231	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe ravine itself. From that height you could see across the tops of the
  2232	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttrees down to the plain below; but what Mowgli looked at was the sides
  2233	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof the ravine, and he saw with a great deal of satisfaction that they
  2234	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tran nearly straight up and down, while the vines and creepers that hung
  2235	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tover them would give no foothold to a tiger who wanted to get out.
  2236	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2237	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Let them breathe, Akela,” he said, holding up his hand. “They have not
  2238	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twinded him yet. Let them breathe. I must tell Shere Khan who comes. We
  2239	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thave him in the trap.”
  2240	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2241	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tHe put his hands to his mouth and shouted down the ravine--it was almost
  2242	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlike shouting down a tunnel--and the echoes jumped from rock to rock.
  2243	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2244	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tAfter a long time there came back the drawling, sleepy snarl of a
  2245	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfull-fed tiger just wakened.
  2246	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2247	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Who calls?” said Shere Khan, and a splendid peacock fluttered up out of
  2248	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe ravine screeching.
  2249	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2250	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I, Mowgli. Cattle thief, it is time to come to the Council Rock!
  2251	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tDown--hurry them down, Akela! Down, Rama, down!”
  2252	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2253	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe herd paused for an instant at the edge of the slope, but Akela gave
  2254	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttongue in the full hunting-yell, and they pitched over one after the
  2255	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tother, just as steamers shoot rapids, the sand and stones spurting up
  2256	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tround them. Once started, there was no chance of stopping, and before
  2257	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthey were fairly in the bed of the ravine Rama winded Shere Khan and
  2258	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbellowed.
  2259	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2260	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Ha! Ha!” said Mowgli, on his back. “Now thou knowest!” and the torrent
  2261	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof black horns, foaming muzzles, and staring eyes whirled down the
  2262	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\travine just as boulders go down in floodtime; the weaker buffaloes being
  2263	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tshouldered out to the sides of the ravine where they tore through the
  2264	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcreepers. They knew what the business was before them--the terrible
  2265	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcharge of the buffalo herd against which no tiger can hope to stand.
  2266	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tShere Khan heard the thunder of their hoofs, picked himself up, and
  2267	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlumbered down the ravine, looking from side to side for some way of
  2268	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tescape, but the walls of the ravine were straight and he had to hold on,
  2269	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\theavy with his dinner and his drink, willing to do anything rather than
  2270	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfight. The herd splashed through the pool he had just left, bellowing
  2271	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttill the narrow cut rang. Mowgli heard an answering bellow from the foot
  2272	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof the ravine, saw Shere Khan turn (the tiger knew if the worst came
  2273	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto the worst it was better to meet the bulls than the cows with their
  2274	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcalves), and then Rama tripped, stumbled, and went on again over
  2275	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsomething soft, and, with the bulls at his heels, crashed full into the
  2276	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tother herd, while the weaker buffaloes were lifted clean off their feet
  2277	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tby the shock of the meeting. That charge carried both herds out into the
  2278	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tplain, goring and stamping and snorting. Mowgli watched his time, and
  2279	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tslipped off Rama’s neck, laying about him right and left with his stick.
  2280	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2281	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Quick, Akela! Break them up. Scatter them, or they will be fighting one
  2282	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tanother. Drive them away, Akela. Hai, Rama! Hai, hai, hai! my children.
  2283	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tSoftly now, softly! It is all over.”
  2284	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2285	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tAkela and Gray Brother ran to and fro nipping the buffaloes’ legs,
  2286	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand though the herd wheeled once to charge up the ravine again, Mowgli
  2287	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmanaged to turn Rama, and the others followed him to the wallows.
  2288	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2289	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tShere Khan needed no more trampling. He was dead, and the kites were
  2290	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcoming for him already.
  2291	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2292	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Brothers, that was a dog’s death,” said Mowgli, feeling for the knife
  2293	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\the always carried in a sheath round his neck now that he lived with men.
  2294	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“But he would never have shown fight. His hide will look well on the
  2295	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tCouncil Rock. We must get to work swiftly.”
  2296	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2297	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tA boy trained among men would never have dreamed of skinning a ten-foot
  2298	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttiger alone, but Mowgli knew better than anyone else how an animal’s
  2299	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tskin is fitted on, and how it can be taken off. But it was hard work,
  2300	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand Mowgli slashed and tore and grunted for an hour, while the wolves
  2301	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlolled out their tongues, or came forward and tugged as he ordered them.
  2302	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tPresently a hand fell on his shoulder, and looking up he saw Buldeo with
  2303	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe Tower musket. The children had told the village about the buffalo
  2304	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tstampede, and Buldeo went out angrily, only too anxious to correct
  2305	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMowgli for not taking better care of the herd. The wolves dropped out of
  2306	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsight as soon as they saw the man coming.
  2307	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2308	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“What is this folly?” said Buldeo angrily. “To think that thou canst
  2309	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tskin a tiger! Where did the buffaloes kill him? It is the Lame Tiger
  2310	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttoo, and there is a hundred rupees on his head. Well, well, we will
  2311	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\toverlook thy letting the herd run off, and perhaps I will give thee one
  2312	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof the rupees of the reward when I have taken the skin to Khanhiwara.”
  2313	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t He fumbled in his waist cloth for flint and steel, and stooped down to
  2314	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsinge Shere Khan’s whiskers. Most native hunters always singe a tiger’s
  2315	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twhiskers to prevent his ghost from haunting them.
  2316	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2317	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Hum!” said Mowgli, half to himself as he ripped back the skin of a
  2318	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tforepaw. “So thou wilt take the hide to Khanhiwara for the reward, and
  2319	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tperhaps give me one rupee? Now it is in my mind that I need the skin for
  2320	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmy own use. Heh! Old man, take away that fire!”
  2321	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2322	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“What talk is this to the chief hunter of the village? Thy luck and the
  2323	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tstupidity of thy buffaloes have helped thee to this kill. The tiger has
  2324	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tjust fed, or he would have gone twenty miles by this time. Thou canst
  2325	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnot even skin him properly, little beggar brat, and forsooth I, Buldeo,
  2326	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmust be told not to singe his whiskers. Mowgli, I will not give thee one
  2327	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tanna of the reward, but only a very big beating. Leave the carcass!”
  2328	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2329	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“By the Bull that bought me,” said Mowgli, who was trying to get at the
  2330	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tshoulder, “must I stay babbling to an old ape all noon? Here, Akela,
  2331	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthis man plagues me.”
  2332	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2333	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBuldeo, who was still stooping over Shere Khan’s head, found himself
  2334	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsprawling on the grass, with a gray wolf standing over him, while Mowgli
  2335	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twent on skinning as though he were alone in all India.
  2336	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2337	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Ye-es,” he said, between his teeth. “Thou art altogether right, Buldeo.
  2338	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThou wilt never give me one anna of the reward. There is an old war
  2339	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbetween this lame tiger and myself--a very old war, and--I have won.”
  2340	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2341	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tTo do Buldeo justice, if he had been ten years younger he would have
  2342	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttaken his chance with Akela had he met the wolf in the woods, but a wolf
  2343	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twho obeyed the orders of this boy who had private wars with man-eating
  2344	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttigers was not a common animal. It was sorcery, magic of the worst kind,
  2345	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthought Buldeo, and he wondered whether the amulet round his neck would
  2346	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tprotect him. He lay as still as still, expecting every minute to see
  2347	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMowgli turn into a tiger too.
  2348	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2349	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Maharaj! Great King,” he said at last in a husky whisper.
  2350	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2351	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Yes,” said Mowgli, without turning his head, chuckling a little.
  2352	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2353	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I am an old man. I did not know that thou wast anything more than a
  2354	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\therdsboy. May I rise up and go away, or will thy servant tear me to
  2355	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tpieces?”
  2356	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2357	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Go, and peace go with thee. Only, another time do not meddle with my
  2358	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgame. Let him go, Akela.”
  2359	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2360	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBuldeo hobbled away to the village as fast as he could, looking back
  2361	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tover his shoulder in case Mowgli should change into something terrible.
  2362	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tWhen he got to the village he told a tale of magic and enchantment and
  2363	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsorcery that made the priest look very grave.
  2364	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2365	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMowgli went on with his work, but it was nearly twilight before he and
  2366	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe wolves had drawn the great gay skin clear of the body.
  2367	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2368	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Now we must hide this and take the buffaloes home! Help me to herd
  2369	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthem, Akela.”
  2370	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2371	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe herd rounded up in the misty twilight, and when they got near the
  2372	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tvillage Mowgli saw lights, and heard the conches and bells in the temple
  2373	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tblowing and banging. Half the village seemed to be waiting for him
  2374	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tby the gate. “That is because I have killed Shere Khan,” he said
  2375	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto himself. But a shower of stones whistled about his ears, and the
  2376	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tvillagers shouted: “Sorcerer! Wolf’s brat! Jungle demon! Go away! Get
  2377	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thence quickly or the priest will turn thee into a wolf again. Shoot,
  2378	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBuldeo, shoot!”
  2379	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2380	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe old Tower musket went off with a bang, and a young buffalo bellowed
  2381	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tin pain.
  2382	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2383	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“More sorcery!” shouted the villagers. “He can turn bullets. Buldeo,
  2384	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthat was thy buffalo.”
  2385	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2386	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Now what is this?” said Mowgli, bewildered, as the stones flew thicker.
  2387	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2388	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“They are not unlike the Pack, these brothers of thine,” said Akela,
  2389	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsitting down composedly. “It is in my head that, if bullets mean
  2390	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tanything, they would cast thee out.”

  2392	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Wolf! Wolf’s cub! Go away!” shouted the priest, waving a sprig of the
  2393	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsacred tulsi plant.
  2394	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2395	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Again? Last time it was because I was a man. This time it is because I
  2396	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tam a wolf. Let us go, Akela.”
  2397	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2398	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tA woman--it was Messua--ran across to the herd, and cried: “Oh, my son,
  2399	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmy son! They say thou art a sorcerer who can turn himself into a beast
  2400	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tat will. I do not believe, but go away or they will kill thee. Buldeo
  2401	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsays thou art a wizard, but I know thou hast avenged Nathoo’s death.”
  2402	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2403	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Come back, Messua!” shouted the crowd. “Come back, or we will stone
  2404	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthee.”
  2405	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2406	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMowgli laughed a little short ugly laugh, for a stone had hit him in
  2407	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe mouth. “Run back, Messua. This is one of the foolish tales they tell
  2408	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tunder the big tree at dusk. I have at least paid for thy son’s life.
  2409	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tFarewell; and run quickly, for I shall send the herd in more swiftly
  2410	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthan their brickbats. I am no wizard, Messua. Farewell!”
  2411	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2412	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Now, once more, Akela,” he cried. “Bring the herd in.”
  2413	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2414	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe buffaloes were anxious enough to get to the village. They hardly
  2415	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tneeded Akela’s yell, but charged through the gate like a whirlwind,
  2416	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tscattering the crowd right and left.
  2417	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2418	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Keep count!” shouted Mowgli scornfully. “It may be that I have stolen
  2419	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tone of them. Keep count, for I will do your herding no more. Fare you
  2420	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twell, children of men, and thank Messua that I do not come in with my
  2421	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twolves and hunt you up and down your street.”
  2422	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2423	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tHe turned on his heel and walked away with the Lone Wolf, and as he
  2424	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlooked up at the stars he felt happy. “No more sleeping in traps for me,
  2425	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tAkela. Let us get Shere Khan’s skin and go away. No, we will not hurt
  2426	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe village, for Messua was kind to me.”
  2427	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2428	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tWhen the moon rose over the plain, making it look all milky, the
  2429	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thorrified villagers saw Mowgli, with two wolves at his heels and a
  2430	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbundle on his head, trotting across at the steady wolf’s trot that eats
  2431	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tup the long miles like fire. Then they banged the temple bells and blew
  2432	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe conches louder than ever. And Messua cried, and Buldeo embroidered
  2433	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe story of his adventures in the jungle, till he ended by saying that
  2434	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tAkela stood up on his hind legs and talked like a man.
  2435	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2436	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe moon was just going down when Mowgli and the two wolves came to the
  2437	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thill of the Council Rock, and they stopped at Mother Wolf’s cave.
  2438	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2439	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“They have cast me out from the Man-Pack, Mother,” shouted Mowgli, “but
  2440	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tI come with the hide of Shere Khan to keep my word.”
  2441	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2442	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMother Wolf walked stiffly from the cave with the cubs behind her, and
  2443	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ther eyes glowed as she saw the skin.
  2444	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2445	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I told him on that day, when he crammed his head and shoulders into
  2446	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthis cave, hunting for thy life, Little Frog--I told him that the hunter
  2447	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twould be the hunted. It is well done.”
  2448	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2449	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Little Brother, it is well done,” said a deep voice in the thicket.
  2450	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“We were lonely in the jungle without thee,” and Bagheera came running
  2451	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto Mowgli’s bare feet. They clambered up the Council Rock together, and
  2452	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMowgli spread the skin out on the flat stone where Akela used to sit,
  2453	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand pegged it down with four slivers of bamboo, and Akela lay down upon
  2454	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tit, and called the old call to the Council, “Look--look well, O Wolves,”
  2455	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t exactly as he had called when Mowgli was first brought there.
  2456	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2457	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tEver since Akela had been deposed, the Pack had been without a leader,
  2458	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thunting and fighting at their own pleasure. But they answered the call
  2459	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfrom habit; and some of them were lame from the traps they had fallen
  2460	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tinto, and some limped from shot wounds, and some were mangy from eating
  2461	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbad food, and many were missing. But they came to the Council Rock, all
  2462	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthat were left of them, and saw Shere Khan’s striped hide on the rock,
  2463	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand the huge claws dangling at the end of the empty dangling feet. It
  2464	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twas then that Mowgli made up a song that came up into his throat all
  2465	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tby itself, and he shouted it aloud, leaping up and down on the rattling
  2466	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tskin, and beating time with his heels till he had no more breath left,
  2467	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twhile Gray Brother and Akela howled between the verses.
  2468	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2469	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Look well, O Wolves. Have I kept my word?” said Mowgli. And the wolves
  2470	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbayed “Yes,” and one tattered wolf howled:
  2471	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2472	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Lead us again, O Akela. Lead us again, O Man-cub, for we be sick of
  2473	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthis lawlessness, and we would be the Free People once more.”
  2474	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2475	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Nay,” purred Bagheera, “that may not be. When ye are full-fed, the
  2476	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmadness may come upon you again. Not for nothing are ye called the Free
  2477	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tPeople. Ye fought for freedom, and it is yours. Eat it, O Wolves.”
  2478	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2479	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Man-Pack and Wolf-Pack have cast me out,” said Mowgli. “Now I will hunt
  2480	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\talone in the jungle.”
  2481	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2482	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“And we will hunt with thee,” said the four cubs.
  2483	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2484	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tSo Mowgli went away and hunted with the four cubs in the jungle from
  2485	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthat day on. But he was not always alone, because, years afterward, he
  2486	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbecame a man and married.
  2487	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2488	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBut that is a story for grown-ups.

  2497	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t

  2500	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2501	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     Shere Khan said he would kill--would kill!  At the gates in the

  2503	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2504	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     He ate and he drank.  Drink deep, Shere Khan, for when wilt thou
  2505	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t        drink again?  Sleep and dream of the kill.
  2506	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2507	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     I am alone on the grazing-grounds.  Gray Brother, come to me!

  2509	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2510	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     Bring up the great bull buffaloes, the blue-skinned herd bulls

  2512	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2513	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     Sleepest thou still, Shere Khan?  Wake, oh, wake!  Here come I,

  2518	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t

  2522	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t

  2525	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2526	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     Up and kill!  Here is meat; break the necks of the bulls!
  2527	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2528	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     Hsh!  He is asleep.  We will not wake him, for his strength is
  2529	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t        very great.  The kites have come down to see it.  The black
  2530	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t        ants have come up to know it.  There is a great assembly in his
  2531	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t        honor.
  2532	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t

  2538	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2539	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     By the Bull that bought me I made a promise--a little promise.

  2558	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2559	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     Wolf Pack, ye have cast me out too.  The jungle is shut to me and

  2561	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t

  2565	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     I dance on the hide of Shere Khan, but my heart is very heavy.  My

  2569	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2570	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     These two things fight together in me as the snakes fight in the
  2571	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t        spring.  The water comes out of my eyes; yet I laugh while it
  2572	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t        falls.  Why?
  2573	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2574	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     I am two Mowglis, but the hide of Shere Khan is under my feet.

  2596	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2597	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2598	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tAll these things happened several years ago at a place called
  2599	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tNovastoshnah, or North East Point, on the Island of St. Paul, away and
  2600	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\taway in the Bering Sea. Limmershin, the Winter Wren, told me the tale
  2601	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twhen he was blown on to the rigging of a steamer going to Japan, and I
  2602	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttook him down into my cabin and warmed and fed him for a couple of days
  2603	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttill he was fit to fly back to St. Paul’s again. Limmershin is a very
  2604	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tquaint little bird, but he knows how to tell the truth.
  2605	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2606	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tNobody comes to Novastoshnah except on business, and the only people
  2607	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twho have regular business there are the seals. They come in the summer
  2608	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmonths by hundreds and hundreds of thousands out of the cold gray sea.
  2609	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tFor Novastoshnah Beach has the finest accommodation for seals of any
  2610	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tplace in all the world.
  2611	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2612	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tSea Catch knew that, and every spring would swim from whatever place
  2613	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\the happened to be in--would swim like a torpedo-boat straight for
  2614	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tNovastoshnah and spend a month fighting with his companions for a good
  2615	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tplace on the rocks, as close to the sea as possible. Sea Catch was
  2616	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfifteen years old, a huge gray fur seal with almost a mane on his
  2617	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tshoulders, and long, wicked dog teeth. When he heaved himself up on his
  2618	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfront flippers he stood more than four feet clear of the ground, and his
  2619	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tweight, if anyone had been bold enough to weigh him, was nearly seven
  2620	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thundred pounds. He was scarred all over with the marks of savage fights,
  2621	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbut he was always ready for just one fight more. He would put his head
  2622	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ton one side, as though he were afraid to look his enemy in the face;
  2623	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthen he would shoot it out like lightning, and when the big teeth were
  2624	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfirmly fixed on the other seal’s neck, the other seal might get away if
  2625	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\the could, but Sea Catch would not help him.
  2626	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2627	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tYet Sea Catch never chased a beaten seal, for that was against the Rules
  2628	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof the Beach. He only wanted room by the sea for his nursery. But as
  2629	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthere were forty or fifty thousand other seals hunting for the same
  2630	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthing each spring, the whistling, bellowing, roaring, and blowing on the
  2631	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbeach was something frightful.
  2632	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2633	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tFrom a little hill called Hutchinson’s Hill, you could look over three
  2634	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand a half miles of ground covered with fighting seals; and the surf was
  2635	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdotted all over with the heads of seals hurrying to land and begin their
  2636	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tshare of the fighting. They fought in the breakers, they fought in the
  2637	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsand, and they fought on the smooth-worn basalt rocks of the nurseries,
  2638	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfor they were just as stupid and unaccommodating as men. Their wives
  2639	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnever came to the island until late in May or early in June, for they
  2640	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdid not care to be torn to pieces; and the young two-, three-, and
  2641	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfour-year-old seals who had not begun housekeeping went inland about
  2642	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thalf a mile through the ranks of the fighters and played about on the
  2643	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsand dunes in droves and legions, and rubbed off every single green
  2644	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthing that grew. They were called the holluschickie--the bachelors--and
  2645	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthere were perhaps two or three hundred thousand of them at Novastoshnah
  2646	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\talone.
  2647	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2648	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tSea Catch had just finished his forty-fifth fight one spring when
  2649	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMatkah, his soft, sleek, gentle-eyed wife, came up out of the sea,
  2650	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand he caught her by the scruff of the neck and dumped her down on his
  2651	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\treservation, saying gruffly: “Late as usual. Where have you been?”
  2652	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2653	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tIt was not the fashion for Sea Catch to eat anything during the four
  2654	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmonths he stayed on the beaches, and so his temper was generally bad.
  2655	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMatkah knew better than to answer back. She looked round and cooed: “How
  2656	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthoughtful of you. You’ve taken the old place again.”
  2657	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2658	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I should think I had,” said Sea Catch. “Look at me!”
  2659	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2660	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tHe was scratched and bleeding in twenty places; one eye was almost out,
  2661	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand his sides were torn to ribbons.
  2662	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2663	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Oh, you men, you men!” Matkah said, fanning herself with her hind
  2664	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tflipper. “Why can’t you be sensible and settle your places quietly? You
  2665	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlook as though you had been fighting with the Killer Whale.”
  2666	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2667	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I haven’t been doing anything but fight since the middle of May. The
  2668	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbeach is disgracefully crowded this season. I’ve met at least a hundred
  2669	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tseals from Lukannon Beach, house hunting. Why can’t people stay where
  2670	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthey belong?”
  2671	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2672	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I’ve often thought we should be much happier if we hauled out at Otter
  2673	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tIsland instead of this crowded place,” said Matkah.
  2674	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2675	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Bah! Only the holluschickie go to Otter Island. If we went there they
  2676	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twould say we were afraid. We must preserve appearances, my dear.”
  2677	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2678	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tSea Catch sunk his head proudly between his fat shoulders and pretended
  2679	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto go to sleep for a few minutes, but all the time he was keeping a
  2680	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsharp lookout for a fight. Now that all the seals and their wives were
  2681	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ton the land, you could hear their clamor miles out to sea above the
  2682	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tloudest gales. At the lowest counting there were over a million seals
  2683	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ton the beach--old seals, mother seals, tiny babies, and holluschickie,
  2684	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfighting, scuffling, bleating, crawling, and playing together--going
  2685	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdown to the sea and coming up from it in gangs and regiments, lying
  2686	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tover every foot of ground as far as the eye could reach, and skirmishing
  2687	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tabout in brigades through the fog. It is nearly always foggy at
  2688	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tNovastoshnah, except when the sun comes out and makes everything look
  2689	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tall pearly and rainbow-colored for a little while.
  2690	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2691	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tKotick, Matkah’s baby, was born in the middle of that confusion, and he
  2692	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twas all head and shoulders, with pale, watery blue eyes, as tiny seals
  2693	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmust be, but there was something about his coat that made his mother
  2694	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlook at him very closely.
  2695	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2696	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Sea Catch,” she said, at last, “our baby’s going to be white!”
  2697	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2698	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Empty clam-shells and dry seaweed!” snorted Sea Catch. “There never has
  2699	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbeen such a thing in the world as a white seal.”
  2700	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2701	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I can’t help that,” said Matkah; “there’s going to be now.” And she
  2702	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsang the low, crooning seal song that all the mother seals sing to their
  2703	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbabies:
  2704	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2705	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     You mustn’t swim till you’re six weeks old,
  2706	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t        Or your head will be sunk by your heels;
  2707	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     And summer gales and Killer Whales
  2708	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t        Are bad for baby seals.
  2709	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2710	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     Are bad for baby seals, dear rat,
  2711	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t        As bad as bad can be;
  2712	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     But splash and grow strong,
  2713	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     And you can’t be wrong.
  2714	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t        Child of the Open Sea!
  2715	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2716	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tOf course the little fellow did not understand the words at first. He
  2717	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tpaddled and scrambled about by his mother’s side, and learned to scuffle
  2718	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tout of the way when his father was fighting with another seal, and the
  2719	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttwo rolled and roared up and down the slippery rocks. Matkah used to go
  2720	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto sea to get things to eat, and the baby was fed only once in two days,
  2721	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbut then he ate all he could and throve upon it.
  2722	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2723	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe first thing he did was to crawl inland, and there he met tens
  2724	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof thousands of babies of his own age, and they played together like
  2725	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tpuppies, went to sleep on the clean sand, and played again. The old
  2726	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tpeople in the nurseries took no notice of them, and the holluschickie
  2727	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tkept to their own grounds, and the babies had a beautiful playtime.
  2728	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2729	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tWhen Matkah came back from her deep-sea fishing she would go straight
  2730	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto their playground and call as a sheep calls for a lamb, and wait until
  2731	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tshe heard Kotick bleat. Then she would take the straightest of straight
  2732	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlines in his direction, striking out with her fore flippers and knocking
  2733	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe youngsters head over heels right and left. There were always a few
  2734	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thundred mothers hunting for their children through the playgrounds, and
  2735	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe babies were kept lively. But, as Matkah told Kotick, “So long as you
  2736	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdon’t lie in muddy water and get mange, or rub the hard sand into a cut
  2737	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tor scratch, and so long as you never go swimming when there is a heavy
  2738	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsea, nothing will hurt you here.”
  2739	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2740	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tLittle seals can no more swim than little children, but they are unhappy
  2741	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttill they learn. The first time that Kotick went down to the sea a wave
  2742	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcarried him out beyond his depth, and his big head sank and his little
  2743	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thind flippers flew up exactly as his mother had told him in the song,
  2744	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand if the next wave had not thrown him back again he would have
  2745	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdrowned.
  2746	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2747	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tAfter that, he learned to lie in a beach pool and let the wash of the
  2748	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twaves just cover him and lift him up while he paddled, but he always
  2749	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tkept his eye open for big waves that might hurt. He was two weeks
  2750	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlearning to use his flippers; and all that while he floundered in and
  2751	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tout of the water, and coughed and grunted and crawled up the beach and
  2752	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttook catnaps on the sand, and went back again, until at last he found
  2753	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthat he truly belonged to the water.
  2754	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2755	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThen you can imagine the times that he had with his companions, ducking
  2756	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tunder the rollers; or coming in on top of a comber and landing with a
  2757	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tswash and a splutter as the big wave went whirling far up the beach; or
  2758	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tstanding up on his tail and scratching his head as the old people did;
  2759	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tor playing “I’m the King of the Castle” on slippery, weedy rocks that
  2760	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tjust stuck out of the wash. Now and then he would see a thin fin, like
  2761	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ta big shark’s fin, drifting along close to shore, and he knew that that
  2762	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twas the Killer Whale, the Grampus, who eats young seals when he can get
  2763	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthem; and Kotick would head for the beach like an arrow, and the fin
  2764	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twould jig off slowly, as if it were looking for nothing at all.
  2765	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2766	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tLate in October the seals began to leave St. Paul’s for the deep sea, by
  2767	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfamilies and tribes, and there was no more fighting over the nurseries,
  2768	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand the holluschickie played anywhere they liked. “Next year,” said
  2769	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMatkah to Kotick, “you will be a holluschickie; but this year you must
  2770	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlearn how to catch fish.”
  2771	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2772	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThey set out together across the Pacific, and Matkah showed Kotick how
  2773	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto sleep on his back with his flippers tucked down by his side and his
  2774	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlittle nose just out of the water. No cradle is so comfortable as the
  2775	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlong, rocking swell of the Pacific. When Kotick felt his skin tingle all
  2776	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tover, Matkah told him he was learning the “feel of the water,” and that
  2777	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttingly, prickly feelings meant bad weather coming, and he must swim hard
  2778	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand get away.
  2779	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2780	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“In a little time,” she said, “you’ll know where to swim to, but just
  2781	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnow we’ll follow Sea Pig, the Porpoise, for he is very wise.” A school
  2782	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof porpoises were ducking and tearing through the water, and little
  2783	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tKotick followed them as fast as he could. “How do you know where to go
  2784	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto?” he panted. The leader of the school rolled his white eye and ducked
  2785	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tunder. “My tail tingles, youngster,” he said. “That means there’s a gale
  2786	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbehind me. Come along! When you’re south of the Sticky Water [he meant
  2787	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe Equator] and your tail tingles, that means there’s a gale in front
  2788	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof you and you must head north. Come along! The water feels bad here.”
  2789	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2790	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThis was one of very many things that Kotick learned, and he was always
  2791	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlearning. Matkah taught him to follow the cod and the halibut along the
  2792	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tunder-sea banks and wrench the rockling out of his hole among the weeds;
  2793	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thow to skirt the wrecks lying a hundred fathoms below water and dart
  2794	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlike a rifle bullet in at one porthole and out at another as the fishes
  2795	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tran; how to dance on the top of the waves when the lightning was racing
  2796	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tall over the sky, and wave his flipper politely to the stumpy-tailed
  2797	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tAlbatross and the Man-of-war Hawk as they went down the wind; how to
  2798	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tjump three or four feet clear of the water like a dolphin, flippers
  2799	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tclose to the side and tail curved; to leave the flying fish alone
  2800	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbecause they are all bony; to take the shoulder-piece out of a cod at
  2801	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfull speed ten fathoms deep, and never to stop and look at a boat or a
  2802	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tship, but particularly a row-boat. At the end of six months what Kotick
  2803	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdid not know about deep-sea fishing was not worth the knowing. And all
  2804	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthat time he never set flipper on dry ground.
  2805	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2806	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tOne day, however, as he was lying half asleep in the warm water
  2807	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsomewhere off the Island of Juan Fernandez, he felt faint and lazy all
  2808	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tover, just as human people do when the spring is in their legs, and he
  2809	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tremembered the good firm beaches of Novastoshnah seven thousand miles
  2810	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\taway, the games his companions played, the smell of the seaweed, the
  2811	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tseal roar, and the fighting. That very minute he turned north, swimming
  2812	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsteadily, and as he went on he met scores of his mates, all bound for
  2813	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe same place, and they said: “Greeting, Kotick! This year we are
  2814	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tall holluschickie, and we can dance the Fire-dance in the breakers off
  2815	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tLukannon and play on the new grass. But where did you get that coat?”
  2816	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2817	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tKotick’s fur was almost pure white now, and though he felt very proud of
  2818	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tit, he only said, “Swim quickly! My bones are aching for the land.” And
  2819	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tso they all came to the beaches where they had been born, and heard the
  2820	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\told seals, their fathers, fighting in the rolling mist.
  2821	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2822	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThat night Kotick danced the Fire-dance with the yearling seals. The sea
  2823	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tis full of fire on summer nights all the way down from Novastoshnah to
  2824	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tLukannon, and each seal leaves a wake like burning oil behind him and a
  2825	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tflaming flash when he jumps, and the waves break in great phosphorescent
  2826	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tstreaks and swirls. Then they went inland to the holluschickie grounds
  2827	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand rolled up and down in the new wild wheat and told stories of what
  2828	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthey had done while they had been at sea. They talked about the Pacific
  2829	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tas boys would talk about a wood that they had been nutting in, and if
  2830	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tanyone had understood them he could have gone away and made such a chart
  2831	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof that ocean as never was. The three- and four-year-old holluschickie
  2832	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tromped down from Hutchinson’s Hill crying: “Out of the way, youngsters!
  2833	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe sea is deep and you don’t know all that’s in it yet. Wait till
  2834	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tyou’ve rounded the Horn. Hi, you yearling, where did you get that white
  2835	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcoat?”
  2836	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2837	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I didn’t get it,” said Kotick. “It grew.” And just as he was going to
  2838	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\troll the speaker over, a couple of black-haired men with flat red faces
  2839	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcame from behind a sand dune, and Kotick, who had never seen a man
  2840	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbefore, coughed and lowered his head. The holluschickie just bundled off
  2841	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ta few yards and sat staring stupidly. The men were no less than Kerick
  2842	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBooterin, the chief of the seal-hunters on the island, and Patalamon,
  2843	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\this son. They came from the little village not half a mile from the sea
  2844	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnurseries, and they were deciding what seals they would drive up to the
  2845	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tkilling pens--for the seals were driven just like sheep--to be turned
  2846	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tinto seal-skin jackets later on.
  2847	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2848	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Ho!” said Patalamon. “Look! There’s a white seal!”
  2849	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2850	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tKerick Booterin turned nearly white under his oil and smoke, for he was
  2851	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tan Aleut, and Aleuts are not clean people. Then he began to mutter a
  2852	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tprayer. “Don’t touch him, Patalamon. There has never been a white seal
  2853	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsince--since I was born. Perhaps it is old Zaharrof’s ghost. He was lost
  2854	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlast year in the big gale.”
  2855	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2856	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I’m not going near him,” said Patalamon. “He’s unlucky. Do you really
  2857	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthink he is old Zaharrof come back? I owe him for some gulls’ eggs.”
  2858	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2859	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Don’t look at him,” said Kerick. “Head off that drove of
  2860	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfour-year-olds. The men ought to skin two hundred to-day, but it’s the
  2861	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbeginning of the season and they are new to the work. A hundred will do.
  2862	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tQuick!”
  2863	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2864	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tPatalamon rattled a pair of seal’s shoulder bones in front of a herd
  2865	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof holluschickie and they stopped dead, puffing and blowing. Then he
  2866	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tstepped near and the seals began to move, and Kerick headed them inland,
  2867	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand they never tried to get back to their companions. Hundreds and
  2868	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thundreds of thousands of seals watched them being driven, but they went
  2869	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ton playing just the same. Kotick was the only one who asked questions,
  2870	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand none of his companions could tell him anything, except that the
  2871	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmen always drove seals in that way for six weeks or two months of every
  2872	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tyear.
  2873	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2874	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I am going to follow,” he said, and his eyes nearly popped out of his
  2875	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thead as he shuffled along in the wake of the herd.
  2876	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2877	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“The white seal is coming after us,” cried Patalamon. “That’s the first
  2878	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttime a seal has ever come to the killing-grounds alone.”
  2879	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2880	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Hsh! Don’t look behind you,” said Kerick. “It is Zaharrof’s ghost! I
  2881	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmust speak to the priest about this.”
  2882	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2883	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe distance to the killing-grounds was only half a mile, but it took an
  2884	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thour to cover, because if the seals went too fast Kerick knew that they
  2885	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twould get heated and then their fur would come off in patches when they
  2886	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twere skinned. So they went on very slowly, past Sea Lion’s Neck, past
  2887	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tWebster House, till they came to the Salt House just beyond the sight
  2888	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof the seals on the beach. Kotick followed, panting and wondering.
  2889	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tHe thought that he was at the world’s end, but the roar of the seal
  2890	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnurseries behind him sounded as loud as the roar of a train in a tunnel.
  2891	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThen Kerick sat down on the moss and pulled out a heavy pewter watch
  2892	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand let the drove cool off for thirty minutes, and Kotick could hear the
  2893	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfog-dew dripping off the brim of his cap. Then ten or twelve men, each
  2894	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twith an iron-bound club three or four feet long, came up, and Kerick
  2895	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tpointed out one or two of the drove that were bitten by their companions
  2896	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tor too hot, and the men kicked those aside with their heavy boots made
  2897	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof the skin of a walrus’s throat, and then Kerick said, “Let go!” and
  2898	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthen the men clubbed the seals on the head as fast as they could.
  2899	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2900	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tTen minutes later little Kotick did not recognize his friends any more,
  2901	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfor their skins were ripped off from the nose to the hind flippers,
  2902	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twhipped off and thrown down on the ground in a pile. That was enough
  2903	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfor Kotick. He turned and galloped (a seal can gallop very swiftly for
  2904	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ta short time) back to the sea; his little new mustache bristling with
  2905	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thorror. At Sea Lion’s Neck, where the great sea lions sit on the edge
  2906	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof the surf, he flung himself flipper-overhead into the cool water and
  2907	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\trocked there, gasping miserably. “What’s here?” said a sea lion gruffly,
  2908	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfor as a rule the sea lions keep themselves to themselves.
  2909	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2910	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Scoochnie! Ochen scoochnie!” (“I’m lonesome, very lonesome!”) said
  2911	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tKotick. “They’re killing all the holluschickie on all the beaches!”
  2912	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2913	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe Sea Lion turned his head inshore. “Nonsense!” he said. “Your
  2914	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfriends are making as much noise as ever. You must have seen old Kerick
  2915	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tpolishing off a drove. He’s done that for thirty years.”
  2916	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2917	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“It’s horrible,” said Kotick, backing water as a wave went over him, and
  2918	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsteadying himself with a screw stroke of his flippers that brought him
  2919	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tall standing within three inches of a jagged edge of rock.
  2920	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2921	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Well done for a yearling!” said the Sea Lion, who could appreciate good
  2922	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tswimming. “I suppose it is rather awful from your way of looking at it,
  2923	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbut if you seals will come here year after year, of course the men get
  2924	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto know of it, and unless you can find an island where no men ever come
  2925	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tyou will always be driven.”
  2926	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2927	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Isn’t there any such island?” began Kotick.
  2928	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2929	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I’ve followed the poltoos [the halibut] for twenty years, and I can’t
  2930	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsay I’ve found it yet. But look here--you seem to have a fondness for
  2931	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttalking to your betters--suppose you go to Walrus Islet and talk to
  2932	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tSea Vitch. He may know something. Don’t flounce off like that. It’s a
  2933	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsix-mile swim, and if I were you I should haul out and take a nap first,
  2934	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlittle one.”
  2935	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2936	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tKotick thought that that was good advice, so he swam round to his own
  2937	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbeach, hauled out, and slept for half an hour, twitching all over, as
  2938	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tseals will. Then he headed straight for Walrus Islet, a little low sheet
  2939	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof rocky island almost due northeast from Novastoshnah, all ledges and
  2940	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\trock and gulls’ nests, where the walrus herded by themselves.
  2941	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2942	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tHe landed close to old Sea Vitch--the big, ugly, bloated, pimpled,
  2943	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfat-necked, long-tusked walrus of the North Pacific, who has no manners
  2944	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\texcept when he is asleep--as he was then, with his hind flippers half in
  2945	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand half out of the surf.
  2946	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2947	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Wake up!” barked Kotick, for the gulls were making a great noise.
  2948	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2949	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Hah! Ho! Hmph! What’s that?” said Sea Vitch, and he struck the next
  2950	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twalrus a blow with his tusks and waked him up, and the next struck the
  2951	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnext, and so on till they were all awake and staring in every direction
  2952	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbut the right one.
  2953	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2954	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Hi! It’s me,” said Kotick, bobbing in the surf and looking like a
  2955	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlittle white slug.
  2956	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2957	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Well! May I be--skinned!” said Sea Vitch, and they all looked at Kotick
  2958	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tas you can fancy a club full of drowsy old gentlemen would look at a
  2959	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlittle boy. Kotick did not care to hear any more about skinning just
  2960	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthen; he had seen enough of it. So he called out: “Isn’t there any place
  2961	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfor seals to go where men don’t ever come?”
  2962	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2963	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Go and find out,” said Sea Vitch, shutting his eyes. “Run away. We’re
  2964	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbusy here.”
  2965	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2966	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tKotick made his dolphin-jump in the air and shouted as loud as he could:
  2967	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Clam-eater! Clam-eater!” He knew that Sea Vitch never caught a fish in
  2968	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\this life but always rooted for clams and seaweed; though he pretended to
  2969	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbe a very terrible person. Naturally the Chickies and the Gooverooskies
  2970	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand the Epatkas--the Burgomaster Gulls and the Kittiwakes and the
  2971	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tPuffins, who are always looking for a chance to be rude, took up the
  2972	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcry, and--so Limmershin told me--for nearly five minutes you could not
  2973	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thave heard a gun fired on Walrus Islet. All the population was yelling
  2974	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand screaming “Clam-eater! Stareek [old man]!” while Sea Vitch rolled
  2975	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfrom side to side grunting and coughing.
  2976	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2977	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Now will you tell?” said Kotick, all out of breath.
  2978	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2979	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Go and ask Sea Cow,” said Sea Vitch. “If he is living still, he’ll be
  2980	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\table to tell you.”
  2981	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2982	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“How shall I know Sea Cow when I meet him?” said Kotick, sheering off.
  2983	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2984	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“He’s the only thing in the sea uglier than Sea Vitch,” screamed a
  2985	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBurgomaster gull, wheeling under Sea Vitch’s nose. “Uglier, and with
  2986	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tworse manners! Stareek!”
  2987	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2988	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tKotick swam back to Novastoshnah, leaving the gulls to scream. There he
  2989	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfound that no one sympathized with him in his little attempt to discover
  2990	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ta quiet place for the seals. They told him that men had always driven
  2991	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe holluschickie--it was part of the day’s work--and that if he did not
  2992	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlike to see ugly things he should not have gone to the killing grounds.
  2993	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBut none of the other seals had seen the killing, and that made the
  2994	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdifference between him and his friends. Besides, Kotick was a white
  2995	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tseal.
  2996	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  2997	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“What you must do,” said old Sea Catch, after he had heard his son’s
  2998	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tadventures, “is to grow up and be a big seal like your father, and have
  2999	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ta nursery on the beach, and then they will leave you alone. In another
  3000	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfive years you ought to be able to fight for yourself.” Even gentle
  3001	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMatkah, his mother, said: “You will never be able to stop the killing.
  3002	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tGo and play in the sea, Kotick.” And Kotick went off and danced the
  3003	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tFire-dance with a very heavy little heart.
  3004	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3005	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThat autumn he left the beach as soon as he could, and set off alone
  3006	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbecause of a notion in his bullet-head. He was going to find Sea Cow,
  3007	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tif there was such a person in the sea, and he was going to find a quiet
  3008	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tisland with good firm beaches for seals to live on, where men could not
  3009	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tget at them. So he explored and explored by himself from the North to
  3010	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe South Pacific, swimming as much as three hundred miles in a day
  3011	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand a night. He met with more adventures than can be told, and narrowly
  3012	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tescaped being caught by the Basking Shark, and the Spotted Shark, and
  3013	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe Hammerhead, and he met all the untrustworthy ruffians that loaf up
  3014	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand down the seas, and the heavy polite fish, and the scarlet spotted
  3015	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tscallops that are moored in one place for hundreds of years, and grow
  3016	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tvery proud of it; but he never met Sea Cow, and he never found an island
  3017	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthat he could fancy.
  3018	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3019	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tIf the beach was good and hard, with a slope behind it for seals to play
  3020	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ton, there was always the smoke of a whaler on the horizon, boiling down
  3021	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tblubber, and Kotick knew what that meant. Or else he could see that
  3022	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tseals had once visited the island and been killed off, and Kotick knew
  3023	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthat where men had come once they would come again.
  3024	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3025	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tHe picked up with an old stumpy-tailed albatross, who told him that
  3026	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tKerguelen Island was the very place for peace and quiet, and when Kotick
  3027	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twent down there he was all but smashed to pieces against some wicked
  3028	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tblack cliffs in a heavy sleet-storm with lightning and thunder. Yet as
  3029	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\the pulled out against the gale he could see that even there had once
  3030	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbeen a seal nursery. And it was so in all the other islands that he
  3031	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tvisited.
  3032	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3033	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tLimmershin gave a long list of them, for he said that Kotick spent five
  3034	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tseasons exploring, with a four months’ rest each year at Novastoshnah,
  3035	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twhen the holluschickie used to make fun of him and his imaginary
  3036	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tislands. He went to the Gallapagos, a horrid dry place on the Equator,
  3037	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twhere he was nearly baked to death; he went to the Georgia Islands,
  3038	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe Orkneys, Emerald Island, Little Nightingale Island, Gough’s Island,
  3039	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBouvet’s Island, the Crossets, and even to a little speck of an island
  3040	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsouth of the Cape of Good Hope. But everywhere the People of the Sea
  3041	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttold him the same things. Seals had come to those islands once upon a
  3042	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttime, but men had killed them all off. Even when he swam thousands of
  3043	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmiles out of the Pacific and got to a place called Cape Corrientes (that
  3044	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twas when he was coming back from Gough’s Island), he found a few hundred
  3045	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmangy seals on a rock and they told him that men came there too.
  3046	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3047	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThat nearly broke his heart, and he headed round the Horn back to his
  3048	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\town beaches; and on his way north he hauled out on an island full of
  3049	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgreen trees, where he found an old, old seal who was dying, and Kotick
  3050	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcaught fish for him and told him all his sorrows. “Now,” said Kotick,
  3051	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I am going back to Novastoshnah, and if I am driven to the killing-pens
  3052	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twith the holluschickie I shall not care.”
  3053	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3054	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe old seal said, “Try once more. I am the last of the Lost Rookery of
  3055	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMasafuera, and in the days when men killed us by the hundred thousand
  3056	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthere was a story on the beaches that some day a white seal would come
  3057	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tout of the North and lead the seal people to a quiet place. I am old,
  3058	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand I shall never live to see that day, but others will. Try once more.”
  3059	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3060	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tAnd Kotick curled up his mustache (it was a beauty) and said, “I am the
  3061	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tonly white seal that has ever been born on the beaches, and I am the
  3062	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tonly seal, black or white, who ever thought of looking for new islands.”
  3063	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3064	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThis cheered him immensely; and when he came back to Novastoshnah that
  3065	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsummer, Matkah, his mother, begged him to marry and settle down, for
  3066	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\the was no longer a holluschick but a full-grown sea-catch, with a curly
  3067	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twhite mane on his shoulders, as heavy, as big, and as fierce as his
  3068	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfather. “Give me another season,” he said. “Remember, Mother, it is
  3069	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\talways the seventh wave that goes farthest up the beach.”
  3070	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3071	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tCuriously enough, there was another seal who thought that she would put
  3072	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\toff marrying till the next year, and Kotick danced the Fire-dance with
  3073	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ther all down Lukannon Beach the night before he set off on his last
  3074	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\texploration. This time he went westward, because he had fallen on the
  3075	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttrail of a great shoal of halibut, and he needed at least one hundred
  3076	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tpounds of fish a day to keep him in good condition. He chased them till
  3077	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\the was tired, and then he curled himself up and went to sleep on the
  3078	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thollows of the ground swell that sets in to Copper Island. He knew the
  3079	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcoast perfectly well, so about midnight, when he felt himself gently
  3080	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbumped on a weed-bed, he said, “Hm, tide’s running strong tonight,” and
  3081	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tturning over under water opened his eyes slowly and stretched. Then
  3082	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\the jumped like a cat, for he saw huge things nosing about in the shoal
  3083	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twater and browsing on the heavy fringes of the weeds.
  3084	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3085	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“By the Great Combers of Magellan!” he said, beneath his mustache. “Who
  3086	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tin the Deep Sea are these people?”
  3087	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3088	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThey were like no walrus, sea lion, seal, bear, whale, shark, fish,
  3089	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsquid, or scallop that Kotick had ever seen before. They were between
  3090	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttwenty and thirty feet long, and they had no hind flippers, but a
  3091	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tshovel-like tail that looked as if it had been whittled out of wet
  3092	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tleather. Their heads were the most foolish-looking things you ever saw,
  3093	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand they balanced on the ends of their tails in deep water when they
  3094	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tweren’t grazing, bowing solemnly to each other and waving their front
  3095	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tflippers as a fat man waves his arm.
  3096	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3097	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Ahem!” said Kotick. “Good sport, gentlemen?” The big things answered by
  3098	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbowing and waving their flippers like the Frog Footman. When they began
  3099	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfeeding again Kotick saw that their upper lip was split into two pieces
  3100	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthat they could twitch apart about a foot and bring together again with
  3101	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ta whole bushel of seaweed between the splits. They tucked the stuff into
  3102	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttheir mouths and chumped solemnly.
  3103	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3104	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Messy style of feeding, that,” said Kotick. They bowed again, and
  3105	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tKotick began to lose his temper. “Very good,” he said. “If you do happen
  3106	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto have an extra joint in your front flipper you needn’t show off so. I
  3107	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsee you bow gracefully, but I should like to know your names.” The split
  3108	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlips moved and twitched; and the glassy green eyes stared, but they did
  3109	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnot speak.
  3110	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3111	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Well!” said Kotick. “You’re the only people I’ve ever met uglier than
  3112	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tSea Vitch--and with worse manners.”
  3113	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3114	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThen he remembered in a flash what the Burgomaster gull had screamed
  3115	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto him when he was a little yearling at Walrus Islet, and he tumbled
  3116	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbackward in the water, for he knew that he had found Sea Cow at last.
  3117	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3118	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe sea cows went on schlooping and grazing and chumping in the weed,
  3119	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand Kotick asked them questions in every language that he had picked
  3120	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tup in his travels; and the Sea People talk nearly as many languages as
  3121	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thuman beings. But the sea cows did not answer because Sea Cow cannot
  3122	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttalk. He has only six bones in his neck where he ought to have seven,
  3123	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand they say under the sea that that prevents him from speaking even
  3124	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto his companions. But, as you know, he has an extra joint in his
  3125	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tforeflipper, and by waving it up and down and about he makes what
  3126	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tanswers to a sort of clumsy telegraphic code.
  3127	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3128	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBy daylight Kotick’s mane was standing on end and his temper was gone
  3129	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twhere the dead crabs go. Then the Sea Cow began to travel northward very
  3130	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tslowly, stopping to hold absurd bowing councils from time to time, and
  3131	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tKotick followed them, saying to himself, “People who are such idiots as
  3132	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthese are would have been killed long ago if they hadn’t found out some
  3133	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsafe island. And what is good enough for the Sea Cow is good enough for
  3134	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe Sea Catch. All the same, I wish they’d hurry.”
  3135	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3136	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tIt was weary work for Kotick. The herd never went more than forty or
  3137	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfifty miles a day, and stopped to feed at night, and kept close to the
  3138	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tshore all the time; while Kotick swam round them, and over them, and
  3139	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tunder them, but he could not hurry them up one-half mile. As they went
  3140	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfarther north they held a bowing council every few hours, and Kotick
  3141	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnearly bit off his mustache with impatience till he saw that they were
  3142	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfollowing up a warm current of water, and then he respected them more.
  3143	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3144	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tOne night they sank through the shiny water--sank like stones--and for
  3145	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe first time since he had known them began to swim quickly. Kotick
  3146	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfollowed, and the pace astonished him, for he never dreamed that Sea Cow
  3147	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twas anything of a swimmer. They headed for a cliff by the shore--a cliff
  3148	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthat ran down into deep water, and plunged into a dark hole at the
  3149	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfoot of it, twenty fathoms under the sea. It was a long, long swim, and
  3150	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tKotick badly wanted fresh air before he was out of the dark tunnel they
  3151	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tled him through.
  3152	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3153	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“My wig!” he said, when he rose, gasping and puffing, into open water at
  3154	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe farther end. “It was a long dive, but it was worth it.”
  3155	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3156	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe sea cows had separated and were browsing lazily along the edges of
  3157	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe finest beaches that Kotick had ever seen. There were long
  3158	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tstretches of smooth-worn rock running for miles, exactly fitted to make
  3159	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tseal-nurseries, and there were play-grounds of hard sand sloping inland
  3160	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbehind them, and there were rollers for seals to dance in, and long
  3161	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgrass to roll in, and sand dunes to climb up and down, and, best of all,
  3162	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tKotick knew by the feel of the water, which never deceives a true sea
  3163	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcatch, that no men had ever come there.
  3164	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3165	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe first thing he did was to assure himself that the fishing was good,
  3166	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand then he swam along the beaches and counted up the delightful low
  3167	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsandy islands half hidden in the beautiful rolling fog. Away to the
  3168	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnorthward, out to sea, ran a line of bars and shoals and rocks that
  3169	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twould never let a ship come within six miles of the beach, and between
  3170	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe islands and the mainland was a stretch of deep water that ran up to
  3171	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe perpendicular cliffs, and somewhere below the cliffs was the mouth
  3172	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof the tunnel.
  3173	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3174	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“It’s Novastoshnah over again, but ten times better,” said Kotick. “Sea
  3175	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tCow must be wiser than I thought. Men can’t come down the cliffs, even
  3176	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tif there were any men; and the shoals to seaward would knock a ship to
  3177	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsplinters. If any place in the sea is safe, this is it.”
  3178	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3179	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tHe began to think of the seal he had left behind him, but though he was
  3180	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tin a hurry to go back to Novastoshnah, he thoroughly explored the new
  3181	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcountry, so that he would be able to answer all questions.
  3182	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3183	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThen he dived and made sure of the mouth of the tunnel, and raced
  3184	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthrough to the southward. No one but a sea cow or a seal would have
  3185	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdreamed of there being such a place, and when he looked back at the
  3186	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcliffs even Kotick could hardly believe that he had been under them.
  3187	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3188	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tHe was six days going home, though he was not swimming slowly; and when
  3189	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\the hauled out just above Sea Lion’s Neck the first person he met was the
  3190	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tseal who had been waiting for him, and she saw by the look in his eyes
  3191	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthat he had found his island at last.
  3192	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3193	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBut the holluschickie and Sea Catch, his father, and all the other seals
  3194	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlaughed at him when he told them what he had discovered, and a young
  3195	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tseal about his own age said, “This is all very well, Kotick, but you
  3196	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcan’t come from no one knows where and order us off like this. Remember
  3197	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twe’ve been fighting for our nurseries, and that’s a thing you never did.
  3198	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tYou preferred prowling about in the sea.”
  3199	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3200	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe other seals laughed at this, and the young seal began twisting his
  3201	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thead from side to side. He had just married that year, and was making a
  3202	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgreat fuss about it.
  3203	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3204	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I’ve no nursery to fight for,” said Kotick. “I only want to show you
  3205	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tall a place where you will be safe. What’s the use of fighting?”
  3206	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3207	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Oh, if you’re trying to back out, of course I’ve no more to say,” said
  3208	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe young seal with an ugly chuckle.
  3209	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3210	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Will you come with me if I win?” said Kotick. And a green light came
  3211	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tinto his eye, for he was very angry at having to fight at all.
  3212	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3213	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Very good,” said the young seal carelessly. “If you win, I’ll come.”
  3214	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3215	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tHe had no time to change his mind, for Kotick’s head was out and his
  3216	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tteeth sunk in the blubber of the young seal’s neck. Then he threw
  3217	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thimself back on his haunches and hauled his enemy down the beach, shook
  3218	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thim, and knocked him over. Then Kotick roared to the seals: “I’ve done
  3219	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmy best for you these five seasons past. I’ve found you the island where
  3220	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tyou’ll be safe, but unless your heads are dragged off your silly necks
  3221	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tyou won’t believe. I’m going to teach you now. Look out for yourselves!”
  3222	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3223	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tLimmershin told me that never in his life--and Limmershin sees ten
  3224	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthousand big seals fighting every year--never in all his little life
  3225	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdid he see anything like Kotick’s charge into the nurseries. He flung
  3226	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thimself at the biggest sea catch he could find, caught him by the
  3227	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthroat, choked him and bumped him and banged him till he grunted for
  3228	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmercy, and then threw him aside and attacked the next. You see, Kotick
  3229	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thad never fasted for four months as the big seals did every year, and
  3230	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\this deep-sea swimming trips kept him in perfect condition, and, best
  3231	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof all, he had never fought before. His curly white mane stood up with
  3232	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\trage, and his eyes flamed, and his big dog teeth glistened, and he was
  3233	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsplendid to look at. Old Sea Catch, his father, saw him tearing past,
  3234	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thauling the grizzled old seals about as though they had been halibut,
  3235	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand upsetting the young bachelors in all directions; and Sea Catch gave
  3236	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ta roar and shouted: “He may be a fool, but he is the best fighter on the
  3237	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbeaches! Don’t tackle your father, my son! He’s with you!”
  3238	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3239	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tKotick roared in answer, and old Sea Catch waddled in with his mustache
  3240	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ton end, blowing like a locomotive, while Matkah and the seal that was
  3241	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgoing to marry Kotick cowered down and admired their men-folk. It was
  3242	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ta gorgeous fight, for the two fought as long as there was a seal that
  3243	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdared lift up his head, and when there were none they paraded grandly up
  3244	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand down the beach side by side, bellowing.
  3245	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3246	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tAt night, just as the Northern Lights were winking and flashing through
  3247	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe fog, Kotick climbed a bare rock and looked down on the scattered
  3248	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnurseries and the torn and bleeding seals. “Now,” he said, “I’ve taught
  3249	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tyou your lesson.”
  3250	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3251	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“My wig!” said old Sea Catch, boosting himself up stiffly, for he was
  3252	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfearfully mauled. “The Killer Whale himself could not have cut them up
  3253	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tworse. Son, I’m proud of you, and what’s more, I’ll come with you to
  3254	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tyour island--if there is such a place.”
  3255	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3256	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Hear you, fat pigs of the sea. Who comes with me to the Sea Cow’s
  3257	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttunnel? Answer, or I shall teach you again,” roared Kotick.
  3258	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3259	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThere was a murmur like the ripple of the tide all up and down the
  3260	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbeaches. “We will come,” said thousands of tired voices. “We will follow
  3261	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tKotick, the White Seal.”
  3262	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3263	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThen Kotick dropped his head between his shoulders and shut his eyes
  3264	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tproudly. He was not a white seal any more, but red from head to tail.
  3265	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tAll the same he would have scorned to look at or touch one of his
  3266	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twounds.
  3267	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3268	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tA week later he and his army (nearly ten thousand holluschickie and old
  3269	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tseals) went away north to the Sea Cow’s tunnel, Kotick leading them,
  3270	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand the seals that stayed at Novastoshnah called them idiots. But next
  3271	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tspring, when they all met off the fishing banks of the Pacific, Kotick’s
  3272	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tseals told such tales of the new beaches beyond Sea Cow’s tunnel that
  3273	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmore and more seals left Novastoshnah. Of course it was not all done at
  3274	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tonce, for the seals are not very clever, and they need a long time to
  3275	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tturn things over in their minds, but year after year more seals went
  3276	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\taway from Novastoshnah, and Lukannon, and the other nurseries, to the
  3277	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tquiet, sheltered beaches where Kotick sits all the summer through,
  3278	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgetting bigger and fatter and stronger each year, while the
  3279	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tholluschickie play around him, in that sea where no man comes.
  3280	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3281	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3282	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3283	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3284	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tLukannon
  3285	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3286	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThis is the great deep-sea song that all the St. Paul seals sing when
  3287	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthey are heading back to their beaches in the summer. It is a sort of
  3288	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tvery sad seal National Anthem.
  3289	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3290	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     I met my mates in the morning (and, oh, but I am old!)
  3291	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     Where roaring on the ledges the summer ground-swell rolled;
  3292	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     I heard them lift the chorus that drowned the breakers’ song--
  3293	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     The Beaches of Lukannon--two million voices strong.
  3294	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3295	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     The song of pleasant stations beside the salt lagoons,
  3296	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     The song of blowing squadrons that shuffled down the dunes,
  3297	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     The song of midnight dances that churned the sea to flame--
  3298	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     The Beaches of Lukannon--before the sealers came!
  3299	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3300	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     I met my mates in the morning (I’ll never meet them more!);
  3301	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     They came and went in legions that darkened all the shore.
  3302	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     And o’er the foam-flecked offing as far as voice could reach
  3303	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     We hailed the landing-parties and we sang them up the beach.
  3304	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3305	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     The Beaches of Lukannon--the winter wheat so tall--
  3306	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     The dripping, crinkled lichens, and the sea-fog drenching all!
  3307	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     The platforms of our playground, all shining smooth and worn!
  3308	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     The Beaches of Lukannon--the home where we were born!
  3309	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3310	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     I met my mates in the morning, a broken, scattered band.
  3311	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     Men shoot us in the water and club us on the land;
  3312	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     Men drive us to the Salt House like silly sheep and tame,
  3313	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     And still we sing Lukannon--before the sealers came.
  3314	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3315	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     Wheel down, wheel down to southward; oh, Gooverooska, go!
  3316	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     And tell the Deep-Sea Viceroys the story of our woe;
  3317	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     Ere, empty as the shark’s egg the tempest flings ashore,
  3318	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     The Beaches of Lukannon shall know their sons no more!

  3335	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t        (Run and hide thee, Nag.)
  3336	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     Hah!  The hooded Death has missed!

  3338	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3339	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThis is the story of the great war that Rikki-tikki-tavi fought
  3340	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsingle-handed, through the bath-rooms of the big bungalow in Segowlee
  3341	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcantonment. Darzee, the Tailorbird, helped him, and Chuchundra, the
  3342	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmusk-rat, who never comes out into the middle of the floor, but always
  3343	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcreeps round by the wall, gave him advice, but Rikki-tikki did the real
  3344	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfighting.
  3345	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3346	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tHe was a mongoose, rather like a little cat in his fur and his tail, but
  3347	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tquite like a weasel in his head and his habits. His eyes and the end
  3348	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof his restless nose were pink. He could scratch himself anywhere he
  3349	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tpleased with any leg, front or back, that he chose to use. He could
  3350	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfluff up his tail till it looked like a bottle brush, and his war cry as
  3351	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\the scuttled through the long grass was: “Rikk-tikk-tikki-tikki-tchk!”
  3352	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3353	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tOne day, a high summer flood washed him out of the burrow where he lived
  3354	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twith his father and mother, and carried him, kicking and clucking, down
  3355	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ta roadside ditch. He found a little wisp of grass floating there, and
  3356	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tclung to it till he lost his senses. When he revived, he was lying in
  3357	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe hot sun on the middle of a garden path, very draggled indeed, and a
  3358	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsmall boy was saying, “Here’s a dead mongoose. Let’s have a funeral.”
  3359	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3360	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“No,” said his mother, “let’s take him in and dry him. Perhaps he isn’t
  3361	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\treally dead.”
  3362	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3363	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThey took him into the house, and a big man picked him up between his
  3364	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfinger and thumb and said he was not dead but half choked. So they
  3365	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twrapped him in cotton wool, and warmed him over a little fire, and he
  3366	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\topened his eyes and sneezed.
  3367	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3368	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Now,” said the big man (he was an Englishman who had just moved into
  3369	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe bungalow), “don’t frighten him, and we’ll see what he’ll do.”
  3370	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3371	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tIt is the hardest thing in the world to frighten a mongoose, because
  3372	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\the is eaten up from nose to tail with curiosity. The motto of all
  3373	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe mongoose family is “Run and find out,” and Rikki-tikki was a true
  3374	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmongoose. He looked at the cotton wool, decided that it was not good to
  3375	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\teat, ran all round the table, sat up and put his fur in order, scratched
  3376	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thimself, and jumped on the small boy’s shoulder.
  3377	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3378	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Don’t be frightened, Teddy,” said his father. “That’s his way of making
  3379	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfriends.”
  3380	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3381	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Ouch! He’s tickling under my chin,” said Teddy.
  3382	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3383	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tRikki-tikki looked down between the boy’s collar and neck, snuffed at
  3384	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\this ear, and climbed down to the floor, where he sat rubbing his nose.
  3385	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3386	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Good gracious,” said Teddy’s mother, “and that’s a wild creature! I
  3387	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsuppose he’s so tame because we’ve been kind to him.”
  3388	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3389	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“All mongooses are like that,” said her husband. “If Teddy doesn’t pick
  3390	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thim up by the tail, or try to put him in a cage, he’ll run in and out of
  3391	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe house all day long. Let’s give him something to eat.”
  3392	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3393	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThey gave him a little piece of raw meat. Rikki-tikki liked it
  3394	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\timmensely, and when it was finished he went out into the veranda and sat
  3395	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tin the sunshine and fluffed up his fur to make it dry to the roots. Then
  3396	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\the felt better.
  3397	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3398	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“There are more things to find out about in this house,” he said to
  3399	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thimself, “than all my family could find out in all their lives. I shall
  3400	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcertainly stay and find out.”
  3401	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3402	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tHe spent all that day roaming over the house. He nearly drowned himself
  3403	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tin the bath-tubs, put his nose into the ink on a writing table, and
  3404	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tburned it on the end of the big man’s cigar, for he climbed up in the
  3405	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbig man’s lap to see how writing was done. At nightfall he ran into
  3406	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tTeddy’s nursery to watch how kerosene lamps were lighted, and when Teddy
  3407	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twent to bed Rikki-tikki climbed up too. But he was a restless companion,
  3408	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbecause he had to get up and attend to every noise all through the
  3409	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnight, and find out what made it. Teddy’s mother and father came in,
  3410	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe last thing, to look at their boy, and Rikki-tikki was awake on
  3411	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe pillow. “I don’t like that,” said Teddy’s mother. “He may bite the
  3412	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tchild.” “He’ll do no such thing,” said the father. “Teddy’s safer with
  3413	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthat little beast than if he had a bloodhound to watch him. If a snake
  3414	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcame into the nursery now--”
  3415	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3416	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBut Teddy’s mother wouldn’t think of anything so awful.
  3417	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3418	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tEarly in the morning Rikki-tikki came to early breakfast in the veranda
  3419	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\triding on Teddy’s shoulder, and they gave him banana and some boiled
  3420	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tegg. He sat on all their laps one after the other, because every
  3421	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twell-brought-up mongoose always hopes to be a house mongoose some day
  3422	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand have rooms to run about in; and Rikki-tikki’s mother (she used to
  3423	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlive in the general’s house at Segowlee) had carefully told Rikki what
  3424	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto do if ever he came across white men.
  3425	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3426	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThen Rikki-tikki went out into the garden to see what was to be seen.
  3427	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tIt was a large garden, only half cultivated, with bushes, as big as
  3428	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsummer-houses, of Marshal Niel roses, lime and orange trees, clumps of
  3429	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbamboos, and thickets of high grass. Rikki-tikki licked his lips. “This
  3430	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tis a splendid hunting-ground,” he said, and his tail grew bottle-brushy
  3431	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tat the thought of it, and he scuttled up and down the garden, snuffing
  3432	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\there and there till he heard very sorrowful voices in a thorn-bush.
  3433	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3434	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tIt was Darzee, the Tailorbird, and his wife. They had made a beautiful
  3435	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnest by pulling two big leaves together and stitching them up the edges
  3436	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twith fibers, and had filled the hollow with cotton and downy fluff. The
  3437	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnest swayed to and fro, as they sat on the rim and cried.
  3438	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3439	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“What is the matter?” asked Rikki-tikki.
  3440	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3441	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“We are very miserable,” said Darzee. “One of our babies fell out of the
  3442	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnest yesterday and Nag ate him.”
  3443	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3444	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“H’m!” said Rikki-tikki, “that is very sad--but I am a stranger here.
  3445	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tWho is Nag?”
  3446	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3447	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tDarzee and his wife only cowered down in the nest without answering, for
  3448	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfrom the thick grass at the foot of the bush there came a low hiss--a
  3449	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thorrid cold sound that made Rikki-tikki jump back two clear feet. Then
  3450	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tinch by inch out of the grass rose up the head and spread hood of Nag,
  3451	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe big black cobra, and he was five feet long from tongue to tail.
  3452	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tWhen he had lifted one-third of himself clear of the ground, he stayed
  3453	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbalancing to and fro exactly as a dandelion tuft balances in the wind,
  3454	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand he looked at Rikki-tikki with the wicked snake’s eyes that never
  3455	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tchange their expression, whatever the snake may be thinking of.
  3456	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3457	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Who is Nag?” said he. “I am Nag. The great God Brahm put his mark upon
  3458	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tall our people, when the first cobra spread his hood to keep the sun off
  3459	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBrahm as he slept. Look, and be afraid!”
  3460	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3461	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tHe spread out his hood more than ever, and Rikki-tikki saw the
  3462	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tspectacle-mark on the back of it that looks exactly like the eye part
  3463	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof a hook-and-eye fastening. He was afraid for the minute, but it is
  3464	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\timpossible for a mongoose to stay frightened for any length of time, and
  3465	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthough Rikki-tikki had never met a live cobra before, his mother had fed
  3466	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thim on dead ones, and he knew that all a grown mongoose’s business in
  3467	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlife was to fight and eat snakes. Nag knew that too and, at the bottom
  3468	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof his cold heart, he was afraid.
  3469	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3470	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Well,” said Rikki-tikki, and his tail began to fluff up again, “marks
  3471	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tor no marks, do you think it is right for you to eat fledglings out of a
  3472	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnest?”
  3473	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3474	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tNag was thinking to himself, and watching the least little movement in
  3475	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe grass behind Rikki-tikki. He knew that mongooses in the garden
  3476	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmeant death sooner or later for him and his family, but he wanted to get
  3477	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tRikki-tikki off his guard. So he dropped his head a little, and put it
  3478	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ton one side.
  3479	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3480	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Let us talk,” he said. “You eat eggs. Why should not I eat birds?”
  3481	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3482	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Behind you! Look behind you!” sang Darzee.
  3483	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3484	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tRikki-tikki knew better than to waste time in staring. He jumped up in
  3485	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe air as high as he could go, and just under him whizzed by the head
  3486	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof Nagaina, Nag’s wicked wife. She had crept up behind him as he was
  3487	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttalking, to make an end of him. He heard her savage hiss as the stroke
  3488	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmissed. He came down almost across her back, and if he had been an old
  3489	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmongoose he would have known that then was the time to break her back
  3490	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twith one bite; but he was afraid of the terrible lashing return stroke
  3491	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof the cobra. He bit, indeed, but did not bite long enough, and he
  3492	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tjumped clear of the whisking tail, leaving Nagaina torn and angry.
  3493	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3494	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Wicked, wicked Darzee!” said Nag, lashing up as high as he could reach
  3495	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttoward the nest in the thorn-bush. But Darzee had built it out of reach
  3496	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof snakes, and it only swayed to and fro.
  3497	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3498	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tRikki-tikki felt his eyes growing red and hot (when a mongoose’s eyes
  3499	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgrow red, he is angry), and he sat back on his tail and hind legs like a
  3500	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlittle kangaroo, and looked all round him, and chattered with rage. But
  3501	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tNag and Nagaina had disappeared into the grass. When a snake misses its
  3502	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tstroke, it never says anything or gives any sign of what it means to do
  3503	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnext. Rikki-tikki did not care to follow them, for he did not feel sure
  3504	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthat he could manage two snakes at once. So he trotted off to the gravel
  3505	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tpath near the house, and sat down to think. It was a serious matter for
  3506	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thim.
  3507	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3508	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tIf you read the old books of natural history, you will find they say
  3509	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthat when the mongoose fights the snake and happens to get bitten,
  3510	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\the runs off and eats some herb that cures him. That is not true.
  3511	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe victory is only a matter of quickness of eye and quickness of
  3512	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfoot--snake’s blow against mongoose’s jump--and as no eye can follow the
  3513	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmotion of a snake’s head when it strikes, this makes things much more
  3514	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twonderful than any magic herb. Rikki-tikki knew he was a young mongoose,
  3515	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand it made him all the more pleased to think that he had managed to
  3516	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tescape a blow from behind. It gave him confidence in himself, and when
  3517	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tTeddy came running down the path, Rikki-tikki was ready to be petted.
  3518	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3519	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBut just as Teddy was stooping, something wriggled a little in the dust,
  3520	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand a tiny voice said: “Be careful. I am Death!” It was Karait, the
  3521	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdusty brown snakeling that lies for choice on the dusty earth; and his
  3522	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbite is as dangerous as the cobra’s. But he is so small that nobody
  3523	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthinks of him, and so he does the more harm to people.
  3524	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3525	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tRikki-tikki’s eyes grew red again, and he danced up to Karait with the
  3526	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tpeculiar rocking, swaying motion that he had inherited from his family.
  3527	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tIt looks very funny, but it is so perfectly balanced a gait that you can
  3528	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfly off from it at any angle you please, and in dealing with snakes this
  3529	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tis an advantage. If Rikki-tikki had only known, he was doing a much more
  3530	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdangerous thing than fighting Nag, for Karait is so small, and can turn
  3531	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tso quickly, that unless Rikki bit him close to the back of the head,
  3532	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\the would get the return stroke in his eye or his lip. But Rikki did not
  3533	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tknow. His eyes were all red, and he rocked back and forth, looking for
  3534	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ta good place to hold. Karait struck out. Rikki jumped sideways and
  3535	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttried to run in, but the wicked little dusty gray head lashed within a
  3536	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfraction of his shoulder, and he had to jump over the body, and the head
  3537	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfollowed his heels close.
  3538	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3539	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tTeddy shouted to the house: “Oh, look here! Our mongoose is killing a
  3540	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsnake.” And Rikki-tikki heard a scream from Teddy’s mother. His father
  3541	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tran out with a stick, but by the time he came up, Karait had lunged out
  3542	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tonce too far, and Rikki-tikki had sprung, jumped on the snake’s back,
  3543	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdropped his head far between his forelegs, bitten as high up the back
  3544	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tas he could get hold, and rolled away. That bite paralyzed Karait, and
  3545	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tRikki-tikki was just going to eat him up from the tail, after the custom
  3546	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof his family at dinner, when he remembered that a full meal makes a
  3547	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tslow mongoose, and if he wanted all his strength and quickness ready, he
  3548	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmust keep himself thin.
  3549	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3550	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tHe went away for a dust bath under the castor-oil bushes, while
  3551	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tTeddy’s father beat the dead Karait. “What is the use of that?” thought
  3552	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tRikki-tikki. “I have settled it all;” and then Teddy’s mother picked
  3553	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thim up from the dust and hugged him, crying that he had saved Teddy
  3554	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfrom death, and Teddy’s father said that he was a providence, and Teddy
  3555	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlooked on with big scared eyes. Rikki-tikki was rather amused at all the
  3556	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfuss, which, of course, he did not understand. Teddy’s mother might just
  3557	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tas well have petted Teddy for playing in the dust. Rikki was thoroughly
  3558	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tenjoying himself.
  3559	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3560	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThat night at dinner, walking to and fro among the wine-glasses on the
  3561	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttable, he might have stuffed himself three times over with nice things.
  3562	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBut he remembered Nag and Nagaina, and though it was very pleasant to be
  3563	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tpatted and petted by Teddy’s mother, and to sit on Teddy’s shoulder, his
  3564	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\teyes would get red from time to time, and he would go off into his long
  3565	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twar cry of “Rikk-tikk-tikki-tikki-tchk!”
  3566	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3567	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tTeddy carried him off to bed, and insisted on Rikki-tikki sleeping under
  3568	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\this chin. Rikki-tikki was too well bred to bite or scratch, but as soon
  3569	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tas Teddy was asleep he went off for his nightly walk round the house,
  3570	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand in the dark he ran up against Chuchundra, the musk-rat, creeping
  3571	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\taround by the wall. Chuchundra is a broken-hearted little beast. He
  3572	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twhimpers and cheeps all the night, trying to make up his mind to run
  3573	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tinto the middle of the room. But he never gets there.
  3574	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3575	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Don’t kill me,” said Chuchundra, almost weeping. “Rikki-tikki, don’t
  3576	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tkill me!”
  3577	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3578	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Do you think a snake-killer kills muskrats?” said Rikki-tikki
  3579	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tscornfully.
  3580	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3581	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Those who kill snakes get killed by snakes,” said Chuchundra, more
  3582	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsorrowfully than ever. “And how am I to be sure that Nag won’t mistake
  3583	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tme for you some dark night?”
  3584	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3585	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“There’s not the least danger,” said Rikki-tikki. “But Nag is in the
  3586	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgarden, and I know you don’t go there.”
  3587	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3588	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“My cousin Chua, the rat, told me--” said Chuchundra, and then he
  3589	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tstopped.
  3590	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3591	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Told you what?”
  3592	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3593	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“H’sh! Nag is everywhere, Rikki-tikki. You should have talked to Chua in
  3594	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe garden.”
  3595	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3596	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I didn’t--so you must tell me. Quick, Chuchundra, or I’ll bite you!”
  3597	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3598	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tChuchundra sat down and cried till the tears rolled off his whiskers.
  3599	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I am a very poor man,” he sobbed. “I never had spirit enough to run out
  3600	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tinto the middle of the room. H’sh! I mustn’t tell you anything. Can’t
  3601	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tyou hear, Rikki-tikki?”
  3602	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3603	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tRikki-tikki listened. The house was as still as still, but he thought he
  3604	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcould just catch the faintest scratch-scratch in the world--a noise as
  3605	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfaint as that of a wasp walking on a window-pane--the dry scratch of a
  3606	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsnake’s scales on brick-work.
  3607	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3608	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“That’s Nag or Nagaina,” he said to himself, “and he is crawling into
  3609	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe bath-room sluice. You’re right, Chuchundra; I should have talked to
  3610	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tChua.”
  3611	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3612	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tHe stole off to Teddy’s bath-room, but there was nothing there, and then
  3613	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto Teddy’s mother’s bathroom. At the bottom of the smooth plaster wall
  3614	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthere was a brick pulled out to make a sluice for the bath water, and as
  3615	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tRikki-tikki stole in by the masonry curb where the bath is put, he heard
  3616	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tNag and Nagaina whispering together outside in the moonlight.
  3617	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3618	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“When the house is emptied of people,” said Nagaina to her husband, “he
  3619	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twill have to go away, and then the garden will be our own again. Go in
  3620	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tquietly, and remember that the big man who killed Karait is the first
  3621	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tone to bite. Then come out and tell me, and we will hunt for Rikki-tikki
  3622	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttogether.”
  3623	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3624	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“But are you sure that there is anything to be gained by killing the
  3625	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tpeople?” said Nag.
  3626	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3627	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Everything. When there were no people in the bungalow, did we have any
  3628	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmongoose in the garden? So long as the bungalow is empty, we are king
  3629	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand queen of the garden; and remember that as soon as our eggs in the
  3630	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmelon bed hatch (as they may tomorrow), our children will need room and
  3631	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tquiet.”
  3632	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3633	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I had not thought of that,” said Nag. “I will go, but there is no need
  3634	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthat we should hunt for Rikki-tikki afterward. I will kill the big man
  3635	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand his wife, and the child if I can, and come away quietly. Then the
  3636	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbungalow will be empty, and Rikki-tikki will go.”
  3637	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3638	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tRikki-tikki tingled all over with rage and hatred at this, and then
  3639	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tNag’s head came through the sluice, and his five feet of cold body
  3640	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfollowed it. Angry as he was, Rikki-tikki was very frightened as he saw
  3641	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe size of the big cobra. Nag coiled himself up, raised his head,
  3642	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand looked into the bathroom in the dark, and Rikki could see his eyes
  3643	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tglitter.
  3644	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3645	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Now, if I kill him here, Nagaina will know; and if I fight him on
  3646	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe open floor, the odds are in his favor. What am I to do?” said
  3647	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tRikki-tikki-tavi.
  3648	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3649	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tNag waved to and fro, and then Rikki-tikki heard him drinking from the
  3650	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbiggest water-jar that was used to fill the bath. “That is good,” said
  3651	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe snake. “Now, when Karait was killed, the big man had a stick. He may
  3652	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thave that stick still, but when he comes in to bathe in the morning he
  3653	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twill not have a stick. I shall wait here till he comes. Nagaina--do you
  3654	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thear me?--I shall wait here in the cool till daytime.”
  3655	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3656	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThere was no answer from outside, so Rikki-tikki knew Nagaina had gone
  3657	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\taway. Nag coiled himself down, coil by coil, round the bulge at the
  3658	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbottom of the water jar, and Rikki-tikki stayed still as death. After an
  3659	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thour he began to move, muscle by muscle, toward the jar. Nag was asleep,
  3660	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand Rikki-tikki looked at his big back, wondering which would be the
  3661	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbest place for a good hold. “If I don’t break his back at the first
  3662	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tjump,” said Rikki, “he can still fight. And if he fights--O Rikki!” He
  3663	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlooked at the thickness of the neck below the hood, but that was too
  3664	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmuch for him; and a bite near the tail would only make Nag savage.
  3665	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3666	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“It must be the head”’ he said at last; “the head above the hood. And,
  3667	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twhen I am once there, I must not let go.”
  3668	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3669	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThen he jumped. The head was lying a little clear of the water jar,
  3670	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tunder the curve of it; and, as his teeth met, Rikki braced his back
  3671	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tagainst the bulge of the red earthenware to hold down the head. This
  3672	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgave him just one second’s purchase, and he made the most of it. Then he
  3673	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twas battered to and fro as a rat is shaken by a dog--to and fro on the
  3674	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfloor, up and down, and around in great circles, but his eyes were red
  3675	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand he held on as the body cart-whipped over the floor, upsetting the
  3676	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttin dipper and the soap dish and the flesh brush, and banged against the
  3677	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttin side of the bath. As he held he closed his jaws tighter and tighter,
  3678	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfor he made sure he would be banged to death, and, for the honor of his
  3679	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfamily, he preferred to be found with his teeth locked. He was dizzy,
  3680	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\taching, and felt shaken to pieces when something went off like a
  3681	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthunderclap just behind him. A hot wind knocked him senseless and red
  3682	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfire singed his fur. The big man had been wakened by the noise, and had
  3683	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfired both barrels of a shotgun into Nag just behind the hood.
  3684	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3685	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tRikki-tikki held on with his eyes shut, for now he was quite sure he was
  3686	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdead. But the head did not move, and the big man picked him up and said,
  3687	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“It’s the mongoose again, Alice. The little chap has saved our lives
  3688	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnow.”
  3689	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3690	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThen Teddy’s mother came in with a very white face, and saw what was
  3691	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tleft of Nag, and Rikki-tikki dragged himself to Teddy’s bedroom and
  3692	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tspent half the rest of the night shaking himself tenderly to find out
  3693	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twhether he really was broken into forty pieces, as he fancied.
  3694	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3695	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tWhen morning came he was very stiff, but well pleased with his doings.
  3696	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Now I have Nagaina to settle with, and she will be worse than five
  3697	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tNags, and there’s no knowing when the eggs she spoke of will hatch.
  3698	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tGoodness! I must go and see Darzee,” he said.
  3699	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3700	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tWithout waiting for breakfast, Rikki-tikki ran to the thornbush where
  3701	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tDarzee was singing a song of triumph at the top of his voice. The news
  3702	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof Nag’s death was all over the garden, for the sweeper had thrown the
  3703	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbody on the rubbish-heap.
  3704	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3705	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Oh, you stupid tuft of feathers!” said Rikki-tikki angrily. “Is this
  3706	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe time to sing?”
  3707	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3708	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Nag is dead--is dead--is dead!” sang Darzee. “The valiant Rikki-tikki
  3709	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcaught him by the head and held fast. The big man brought the
  3710	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbang-stick, and Nag fell in two pieces! He will never eat my babies
  3711	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tagain.”
  3712	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3713	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“All that’s true enough. But where’s Nagaina?” said Rikki-tikki, looking
  3714	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcarefully round him.
  3715	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3716	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Nagaina came to the bathroom sluice and called for Nag,” Darzee went
  3717	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ton, “and Nag came out on the end of a stick--the sweeper picked him up
  3718	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ton the end of a stick and threw him upon the rubbish heap. Let us sing
  3719	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tabout the great, the red-eyed Rikki-tikki!” And Darzee filled his throat
  3720	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand sang.
  3721	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3722	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“If I could get up to your nest, I’d roll your babies out!” said
  3723	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tRikki-tikki. “You don’t know when to do the right thing at the right
  3724	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttime. You’re safe enough in your nest there, but it’s war for me down
  3725	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\there. Stop singing a minute, Darzee.”
  3726	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3727	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“For the great, the beautiful Rikki-tikki’s sake I will stop,” said
  3728	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tDarzee. “What is it, O Killer of the terrible Nag?”
  3729	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3730	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Where is Nagaina, for the third time?”
  3731	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3732	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“On the rubbish heap by the stables, mourning for Nag. Great is
  3733	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tRikki-tikki with the white teeth.”
  3734	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3735	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Bother my white teeth! Have you ever heard where she keeps her eggs?”
  3736	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3737	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“In the melon bed, on the end nearest the wall, where the sun strikes
  3738	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnearly all day. She hid them there weeks ago.”
  3739	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3740	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“And you never thought it worth while to tell me? The end nearest the
  3741	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twall, you said?”
  3742	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3743	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Rikki-tikki, you are not going to eat her eggs?”
  3744	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3745	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Not eat exactly; no. Darzee, if you have a grain of sense you will fly
  3746	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\toff to the stables and pretend that your wing is broken, and let Nagaina
  3747	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tchase you away to this bush. I must get to the melon-bed, and if I went
  3748	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthere now she’d see me.”
  3749	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3750	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tDarzee was a feather-brained little fellow who could never hold more
  3751	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthan one idea at a time in his head. And just because he knew that
  3752	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tNagaina’s children were born in eggs like his own, he didn’t think at
  3753	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfirst that it was fair to kill them. But his wife was a sensible bird,
  3754	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand she knew that cobra’s eggs meant young cobras later on. So she flew
  3755	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\toff from the nest, and left Darzee to keep the babies warm, and continue
  3756	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\this song about the death of Nag. Darzee was very like a man in some
  3757	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tways.
  3758	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3759	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tShe fluttered in front of Nagaina by the rubbish heap and cried out,
  3760	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Oh, my wing is broken! The boy in the house threw a stone at me and
  3761	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbroke it.” Then she fluttered more desperately than ever.
  3762	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3763	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tNagaina lifted up her head and hissed, “You warned Rikki-tikki when I
  3764	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twould have killed him. Indeed and truly, you’ve chosen a bad place to
  3765	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbe lame in.” And she moved toward Darzee’s wife, slipping along over the
  3766	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdust.
  3767	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3768	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“The boy broke it with a stone!” shrieked Darzee’s wife.
  3769	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3770	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Well! It may be some consolation to you when you’re dead to know that I
  3771	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tshall settle accounts with the boy. My husband lies on the rubbish heap
  3772	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthis morning, but before night the boy in the house will lie very still.
  3773	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tWhat is the use of running away? I am sure to catch you. Little fool,
  3774	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlook at me!”
  3775	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3776	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tDarzee’s wife knew better than to do that, for a bird who looks at a
  3777	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsnake’s eyes gets so frightened that she cannot move. Darzee’s wife
  3778	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfluttered on, piping sorrowfully, and never leaving the ground, and
  3779	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tNagaina quickened her pace.
  3780	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3781	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tRikki-tikki heard them going up the path from the stables, and he raced
  3782	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfor the end of the melon patch near the wall. There, in the warm litter
  3783	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tabove the melons, very cunningly hidden, he found twenty-five eggs,
  3784	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tabout the size of a bantam’s eggs, but with whitish skin instead of
  3785	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tshell.
  3786	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3787	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I was not a day too soon,” he said, for he could see the baby cobras
  3788	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcurled up inside the skin, and he knew that the minute they were hatched
  3789	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthey could each kill a man or a mongoose. He bit off the tops of the
  3790	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\teggs as fast as he could, taking care to crush the young cobras, and
  3791	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tturned over the litter from time to time to see whether he had missed
  3792	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tany. At last there were only three eggs left, and Rikki-tikki began to
  3793	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tchuckle to himself, when he heard Darzee’s wife screaming:
  3794	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3795	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Rikki-tikki, I led Nagaina toward the house, and she has gone into the
  3796	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tveranda, and--oh, come quickly--she means killing!”
  3797	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3798	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tRikki-tikki smashed two eggs, and tumbled backward down the melon-bed
  3799	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twith the third egg in his mouth, and scuttled to the veranda as hard as
  3800	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\the could put foot to the ground. Teddy and his mother and father were
  3801	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthere at early breakfast, but Rikki-tikki saw that they were not eating
  3802	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tanything. They sat stone-still, and their faces were white. Nagaina was
  3803	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcoiled up on the matting by Teddy’s chair, within easy striking distance
  3804	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof Teddy’s bare leg, and she was swaying to and fro, singing a song of
  3805	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttriumph.
  3806	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3807	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Son of the big man that killed Nag,” she hissed, “stay still. I am not
  3808	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tready yet. Wait a little. Keep very still, all you three! If you move I
  3809	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tstrike, and if you do not move I strike. Oh, foolish people, who killed
  3810	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmy Nag!”
  3811	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3812	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tTeddy’s eyes were fixed on his father, and all his father could do was
  3813	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto whisper, “Sit still, Teddy. You mustn’t move. Teddy, keep still.”
  3814	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3815	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThen Rikki-tikki came up and cried, “Turn round, Nagaina. Turn and
  3816	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfight!”
  3817	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3818	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“All in good time,” said she, without moving her eyes. “I will settle my
  3819	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\taccount with you presently. Look at your friends, Rikki-tikki. They are
  3820	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tstill and white. They are afraid. They dare not move, and if you come a
  3821	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tstep nearer I strike.”
  3822	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3823	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Look at your eggs,” said Rikki-tikki, “in the melon bed near the wall.
  3824	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tGo and look, Nagaina!”
  3825	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3826	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe big snake turned half around, and saw the egg on the veranda. “Ah-h!
  3827	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tGive it to me,” she said.
  3828	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3829	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tRikki-tikki put his paws one on each side of the egg, and his eyes were
  3830	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tblood-red. “What price for a snake’s egg? For a young cobra? For a
  3831	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tyoung king cobra? For the last--the very last of the brood? The ants are
  3832	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\teating all the others down by the melon bed.”
  3833	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3834	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tNagaina spun clear round, forgetting everything for the sake of the one
  3835	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tegg. Rikki-tikki saw Teddy’s father shoot out a big hand, catch Teddy
  3836	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tby the shoulder, and drag him across the little table with the tea-cups,
  3837	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsafe and out of reach of Nagaina.
  3838	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3839	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Tricked! Tricked! Tricked! Rikk-tck-tck!” chuckled Rikki-tikki. “The
  3840	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tboy is safe, and it was I--I--I that caught Nag by the hood last night
  3841	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tin the bathroom.” Then he began to jump up and down, all four feet
  3842	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttogether, his head close to the floor. “He threw me to and fro, but he
  3843	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcould not shake me off. He was dead before the big man blew him in two.
  3844	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tI did it! Rikki-tikki-tck-tck! Come then, Nagaina. Come and fight with
  3845	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tme. You shall not be a widow long.”
  3846	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3847	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tNagaina saw that she had lost her chance of killing Teddy, and the egg
  3848	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlay between Rikki-tikki’s paws. “Give me the egg, Rikki-tikki. Give me
  3849	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe last of my eggs, and I will go away and never come back,” she said,
  3850	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlowering her hood.
  3851	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3852	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Yes, you will go away, and you will never come back. For you will go
  3853	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto the rubbish heap with Nag. Fight, widow! The big man has gone for his
  3854	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgun! Fight!”
  3855	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3856	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tRikki-tikki was bounding all round Nagaina, keeping just out of reach
  3857	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof her stroke, his little eyes like hot coals. Nagaina gathered herself
  3858	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttogether and flung out at him. Rikki-tikki jumped up and backward. Again
  3859	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand again and again she struck, and each time her head came with a whack
  3860	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ton the matting of the veranda and she gathered herself together like a
  3861	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twatch spring. Then Rikki-tikki danced in a circle to get behind her, and
  3862	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tNagaina spun round to keep her head to his head, so that the rustle of
  3863	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ther tail on the matting sounded like dry leaves blown along by the wind.
  3864	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3865	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tHe had forgotten the egg. It still lay on the veranda, and Nagaina came
  3866	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnearer and nearer to it, till at last, while Rikki-tikki was drawing
  3867	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbreath, she caught it in her mouth, turned to the veranda steps, and
  3868	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tflew like an arrow down the path, with Rikki-tikki behind her. When
  3869	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe cobra runs for her life, she goes like a whip-lash flicked across a
  3870	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thorse’s neck.
  3871	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3872	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tRikki-tikki knew that he must catch her, or all the trouble would begin
  3873	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tagain. She headed straight for the long grass by the thorn-bush, and as
  3874	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\the was running Rikki-tikki heard Darzee still singing his foolish little
  3875	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsong of triumph. But Darzee’s wife was wiser. She flew off her nest
  3876	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tas Nagaina came along, and flapped her wings about Nagaina’s head. If
  3877	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tDarzee had helped they might have turned her, but Nagaina only lowered
  3878	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ther hood and went on. Still, the instant’s delay brought Rikki-tikki up
  3879	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto her, and as she plunged into the rat-hole where she and Nag used to
  3880	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlive, his little white teeth were clenched on her tail, and he went down
  3881	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twith her--and very few mongooses, however wise and old they may be,
  3882	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcare to follow a cobra into its hole. It was dark in the hole; and
  3883	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tRikki-tikki never knew when it might open out and give Nagaina room to
  3884	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tturn and strike at him. He held on savagely, and stuck out his feet to
  3885	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tact as brakes on the dark slope of the hot, moist earth.
  3886	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3887	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThen the grass by the mouth of the hole stopped waving, and Darzee said,
  3888	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“It is all over with Rikki-tikki! We must sing his death song. Valiant
  3889	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tRikki-tikki is dead! For Nagaina will surely kill him underground.”
  3890	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3891	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tSo he sang a very mournful song that he made up on the spur of the
  3892	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tminute, and just as he got to the most touching part, the grass quivered
  3893	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tagain, and Rikki-tikki, covered with dirt, dragged himself out of the
  3894	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thole leg by leg, licking his whiskers. Darzee stopped with a little
  3895	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tshout. Rikki-tikki shook some of the dust out of his fur and sneezed.
  3896	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“It is all over,” he said. “The widow will never come out again.” And
  3897	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe red ants that live between the grass stems heard him, and began to
  3898	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttroop down one after another to see if he had spoken the truth.
  3899	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3900	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tRikki-tikki curled himself up in the grass and slept where he was--slept
  3901	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand slept till it was late in the afternoon, for he had done a hard
  3902	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tday’s work.
  3903	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3904	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Now,” he said, when he awoke, “I will go back to the house. Tell the
  3905	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tCoppersmith, Darzee, and he will tell the garden that Nagaina is dead.”
  3906	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3907	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe Coppersmith is a bird who makes a noise exactly like the beating of
  3908	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ta little hammer on a copper pot; and the reason he is always making it
  3909	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tis because he is the town crier to every Indian garden, and tells all
  3910	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe news to everybody who cares to listen. As Rikki-tikki went up the
  3911	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tpath, he heard his “attention” notes like a tiny dinner gong, and
  3912	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthen the steady “Ding-dong-tock! Nag is dead--dong! Nagaina is dead!
  3913	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tDing-dong-tock!” That set all the birds in the garden singing, and the
  3914	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfrogs croaking, for Nag and Nagaina used to eat frogs as well as little
  3915	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbirds.
  3916	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3917	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tWhen Rikki got to the house, Teddy and Teddy’s mother (she looked very
  3918	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twhite still, for she had been fainting) and Teddy’s father came out and
  3919	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\talmost cried over him; and that night he ate all that was given him till
  3920	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\the could eat no more, and went to bed on Teddy’s shoulder, where Teddy’s
  3921	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmother saw him when she came to look late at night.
  3922	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3923	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“He saved our lives and Teddy’s life,” she said to her husband. “Just
  3924	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthink, he saved all our lives.”
  3925	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3926	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tRikki-tikki woke up with a jump, for the mongooses are light sleepers.
  3927	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3928	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Oh, it’s you,” said he. “What are you bothering for? All the cobras are
  3929	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdead. And if they weren’t, I’m here.”
  3930	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3931	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tRikki-tikki had a right to be proud of himself. But he did not grow too
  3932	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tproud, and he kept that garden as a mongoose should keep it, with tooth
  3933	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand jump and spring and bite, till never a cobra dared show its head
  3934	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tinside the walls.

  3936	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t

  3964	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     Give him the Thanks of the Birds,

  3968	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     Hear!  I will sing you the praise of the bottle-tailed Rikki, with

  3970	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3971	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     (Here Rikki-tikki interrupted, and the rest of the song is

  3988	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3989	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tKala Nag, which means Black Snake, had served the Indian Government in
  3990	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tevery way that an elephant could serve it for forty-seven years, and as
  3991	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\the was fully twenty years old when he was caught, that makes him nearly
  3992	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tseventy--a ripe age for an elephant. He remembered pushing, with a big
  3993	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tleather pad on his forehead, at a gun stuck in deep mud, and that was
  3994	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbefore the Afghan War of 1842, and he had not then come to his full
  3995	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tstrength.
  3996	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  3997	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tHis mother Radha Pyari,--Radha the darling,--who had been caught in the
  3998	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsame drive with Kala Nag, told him, before his little milk tusks had
  3999	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdropped out, that elephants who were afraid always got hurt. Kala Nag
  4000	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tknew that that advice was good, for the first time that he saw a shell
  4001	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tburst he backed, screaming, into a stand of piled rifles, and the
  4002	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbayonets pricked him in all his softest places. So, before he was
  4003	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttwenty-five, he gave up being afraid, and so he was the best-loved
  4004	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand the best-looked-after elephant in the service of the Government of
  4005	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tIndia. He had carried tents, twelve hundred pounds’ weight of tents, on
  4006	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe march in Upper India. He had been hoisted into a ship at the end of
  4007	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ta steam crane and taken for days across the water, and made to carry a
  4008	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmortar on his back in a strange and rocky country very far from India,
  4009	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand had seen the Emperor Theodore lying dead in Magdala, and had
  4010	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcome back again in the steamer entitled, so the soldiers said, to the
  4011	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tAbyssinian War medal. He had seen his fellow elephants die of cold and
  4012	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tepilepsy and starvation and sunstroke up at a place called Ali Musjid,
  4013	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tten years later; and afterward he had been sent down thousands of miles
  4014	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsouth to haul and pile big balks of teak in the timberyards at Moulmein.
  4015	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThere he had half killed an insubordinate young elephant who was
  4016	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tshirking his fair share of work.
  4017	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4018	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tAfter that he was taken off timber-hauling, and employed, with a few
  4019	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tscore other elephants who were trained to the business, in helping to
  4020	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcatch wild elephants among the Garo hills. Elephants are very strictly
  4021	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tpreserved by the Indian Government. There is one whole department which
  4022	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdoes nothing else but hunt them, and catch them, and break them in, and
  4023	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsend them up and down the country as they are needed for work.
  4024	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4025	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tKala Nag stood ten fair feet at the shoulders, and his tusks had been
  4026	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcut off short at five feet, and bound round the ends, to prevent them
  4027	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsplitting, with bands of copper; but he could do more with those stumps
  4028	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthan any untrained elephant could do with the real sharpened ones. When,
  4029	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tafter weeks and weeks of cautious driving of scattered elephants across
  4030	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe hills, the forty or fifty wild monsters were driven into the last
  4031	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tstockade, and the big drop gate, made of tree trunks lashed together,
  4032	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tjarred down behind them, Kala Nag, at the word of command, would go
  4033	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tinto that flaring, trumpeting pandemonium (generally at night, when
  4034	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe flicker of the torches made it difficult to judge distances), and,
  4035	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tpicking out the biggest and wildest tusker of the mob, would hammer
  4036	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thim and hustle him into quiet while the men on the backs of the other
  4037	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\telephants roped and tied the smaller ones.
  4038	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4039	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThere was nothing in the way of fighting that Kala Nag, the old wise
  4040	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBlack Snake, did not know, for he had stood up more than once in his
  4041	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttime to the charge of the wounded tiger, and, curling up his soft trunk
  4042	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto be out of harm’s way, had knocked the springing brute sideways in
  4043	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmid-air with a quick sickle cut of his head, that he had invented all by
  4044	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thimself; had knocked him over, and kneeled upon him with his huge knees
  4045	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttill the life went out with a gasp and a howl, and there was only a
  4046	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfluffy striped thing on the ground for Kala Nag to pull by the tail.
  4047	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4048	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Yes,” said Big Toomai, his driver, the son of Black Toomai who had
  4049	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttaken him to Abyssinia, and grandson of Toomai of the Elephants who had
  4050	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tseen him caught, “there is nothing that the Black Snake fears except me.
  4051	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tHe has seen three generations of us feed him and groom him, and he will
  4052	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlive to see four.”
  4053	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4054	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“He is afraid of me also,” said Little Toomai, standing up to his full
  4055	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\theight of four feet, with only one rag upon him. He was ten years old,
  4056	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe eldest son of Big Toomai, and, according to custom, he would take
  4057	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\this father’s place on Kala Nag’s neck when he grew up, and would handle
  4058	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe heavy iron ankus, the elephant goad, that had been worn smooth by
  4059	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\this father, and his grandfather, and his great-grandfather.
  4060	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4061	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tHe knew what he was talking of; for he had been born under Kala Nag’s
  4062	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tshadow, had played with the end of his trunk before he could walk, had
  4063	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttaken him down to water as soon as he could walk, and Kala Nag would no
  4064	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmore have dreamed of disobeying his shrill little orders than he would
  4065	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thave dreamed of killing him on that day when Big Toomai carried the
  4066	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlittle brown baby under Kala Nag’s tusks, and told him to salute his
  4067	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmaster that was to be.
  4068	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4069	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Yes,” said Little Toomai, “he is afraid of me,” and he took long
  4070	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tstrides up to Kala Nag, called him a fat old pig, and made him lift up
  4071	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\this feet one after the other.
  4072	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4073	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Wah!” said Little Toomai, “thou art a big elephant,” and he wagged his
  4074	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfluffy head, quoting his father. “The Government may pay for elephants,
  4075	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbut they belong to us mahouts. When thou art old, Kala Nag, there will
  4076	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcome some rich rajah, and he will buy thee from the Government, on
  4077	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\taccount of thy size and thy manners, and then thou wilt have nothing
  4078	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto do but to carry gold earrings in thy ears, and a gold howdah on thy
  4079	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tback, and a red cloth covered with gold on thy sides, and walk at the
  4080	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thead of the processions of the King. Then I shall sit on thy neck, O
  4081	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tKala Nag, with a silver ankus, and men will run before us with golden
  4082	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsticks, crying, `Room for the King’s elephant!’ That will be good, Kala
  4083	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tNag, but not so good as this hunting in the jungles.”
  4084	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4085	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Umph!” said Big Toomai. “Thou art a boy, and as wild as a buffalo-calf.
  4086	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThis running up and down among the hills is not the best Government
  4087	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tservice. I am getting old, and I do not love wild elephants. Give me
  4088	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbrick elephant lines, one stall to each elephant, and big stumps to tie
  4089	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthem to safely, and flat, broad roads to exercise upon, instead of this
  4090	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcome-and-go camping. Aha, the Cawnpore barracks were good. There was a
  4091	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbazaar close by, and only three hours’ work a day.”
  4092	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4093	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tLittle Toomai remembered the Cawnpore elephant-lines and said nothing.
  4094	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tHe very much preferred the camp life, and hated those broad, flat roads,
  4095	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twith the daily grubbing for grass in the forage reserve, and the long
  4096	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thours when there was nothing to do except to watch Kala Nag fidgeting in
  4097	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\this pickets.
  4098	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4099	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tWhat Little Toomai liked was to scramble up bridle paths that only an
  4100	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\telephant could take; the dip into the valley below; the glimpses of the
  4101	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twild elephants browsing miles away; the rush of the frightened pig and
  4102	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tpeacock under Kala Nag’s feet; the blinding warm rains, when all the
  4103	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thills and valleys smoked; the beautiful misty mornings when nobody knew
  4104	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twhere they would camp that night; the steady, cautious drive of the wild
  4105	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\telephants, and the mad rush and blaze and hullabaloo of the last night’s
  4106	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdrive, when the elephants poured into the stockade like boulders in a
  4107	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlandslide, found that they could not get out, and flung themselves at
  4108	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe heavy posts only to be driven back by yells and flaring torches and
  4109	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tvolleys of blank cartridge.
  4110	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4111	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tEven a little boy could be of use there, and Toomai was as useful as
  4112	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthree boys. He would get his torch and wave it, and yell with the
  4113	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbest. But the really good time came when the driving out began, and the
  4114	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tKeddah--that is, the stockade--looked like a picture of the end of the
  4115	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tworld, and men had to make signs to one another, because they could not
  4116	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thear themselves speak. Then Little Toomai would climb up to the top of
  4117	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tone of the quivering stockade posts, his sun-bleached brown hair flying
  4118	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tloose all over his shoulders, and he looking like a goblin in the
  4119	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttorch-light. And as soon as there was a lull you could hear his
  4120	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thigh-pitched yells of encouragement to Kala Nag, above the trumpeting
  4121	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand crashing, and snapping of ropes, and groans of the tethered
  4122	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\telephants. “Mael, mael, Kala Nag! (Go on, go on, Black Snake!) Dant do!
  4123	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t(Give him the tusk!) Somalo! Somalo! (Careful, careful!) Maro! Mar! (Hit
  4124	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thim, hit him!) Mind the post! Arre! Arre! Hai! Yai! Kya-a-ah!” he would
  4125	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tshout, and the big fight between Kala Nag and the wild elephant would
  4126	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsway to and fro across the Keddah, and the old elephant catchers would
  4127	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twipe the sweat out of their eyes, and find time to nod to Little Toomai
  4128	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twriggling with joy on the top of the posts.
  4129	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4130	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tHe did more than wriggle. One night he slid down from the post and
  4131	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tslipped in between the elephants and threw up the loose end of a rope,
  4132	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twhich had dropped, to a driver who was trying to get a purchase on
  4133	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe leg of a kicking young calf (calves always give more trouble than
  4134	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfull-grown animals). Kala Nag saw him, caught him in his trunk, and
  4135	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thanded him up to Big Toomai, who slapped him then and there, and put him
  4136	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tback on the post.
  4137	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4138	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tNext morning he gave him a scolding and said, “Are not good brick
  4139	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\telephant lines and a little tent carrying enough, that thou must needs
  4140	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgo elephant catching on thy own account, little worthless? Now those
  4141	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfoolish hunters, whose pay is less than my pay, have spoken to Petersen
  4142	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tSahib of the matter.” Little Toomai was frightened. He did not know much
  4143	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof white men, but Petersen Sahib was the greatest white man in the world
  4144	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto him. He was the head of all the Keddah operations--the man who caught
  4145	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tall the elephants for the Government of India, and who knew more about
  4146	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe ways of elephants than any living man.
  4147	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4148	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“What--what will happen?” said Little Toomai.
  4149	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4150	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Happen! The worst that can happen. Petersen Sahib is a madman. Else why
  4151	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tshould he go hunting these wild devils? He may even require thee to be
  4152	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tan elephant catcher, to sleep anywhere in these fever-filled jungles,
  4153	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand at last to be trampled to death in the Keddah. It is well that this
  4154	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnonsense ends safely. Next week the catching is over, and we of the
  4155	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tplains are sent back to our stations. Then we will march on smooth
  4156	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\troads, and forget all this hunting. But, son, I am angry that thou
  4157	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tshouldst meddle in the business that belongs to these dirty Assamese
  4158	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tjungle folk. Kala Nag will obey none but me, so I must go with him into
  4159	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe Keddah, but he is only a fighting elephant, and he does not help
  4160	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto rope them. So I sit at my ease, as befits a mahout,--not a mere
  4161	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thunter,--a mahout, I say, and a man who gets a pension at the end of
  4162	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\this service. Is the family of Toomai of the Elephants to be trodden
  4163	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tunderfoot in the dirt of a Keddah? Bad one! Wicked one! Worthless son!
  4164	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tGo and wash Kala Nag and attend to his ears, and see that there are no
  4165	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthorns in his feet. Or else Petersen Sahib will surely catch thee and
  4166	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmake thee a wild hunter--a follower of elephant’s foot tracks, a jungle
  4167	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbear. Bah! Shame! Go!”
  4168	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4169	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tLittle Toomai went off without saying a word, but he told Kala Nag all
  4170	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\this grievances while he was examining his feet. “No matter,” said Little
  4171	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tToomai, turning up the fringe of Kala Nag’s huge right ear. “They
  4172	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thave said my name to Petersen Sahib, and perhaps--and perhaps--and
  4173	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tperhaps--who knows? Hai! That is a big thorn that I have pulled out!”
  4174	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4175	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe next few days were spent in getting the elephants together, in
  4176	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twalking the newly caught wild elephants up and down between a couple of
  4177	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttame ones to prevent them giving too much trouble on the downward march
  4178	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto the plains, and in taking stock of the blankets and ropes and things
  4179	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthat had been worn out or lost in the forest.
  4180	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4181	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tPetersen Sahib came in on his clever she-elephant Pudmini; he had been
  4182	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tpaying off other camps among the hills, for the season was coming to an
  4183	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tend, and there was a native clerk sitting at a table under a tree, to
  4184	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tpay the drivers their wages. As each man was paid he went back to his
  4185	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\telephant, and joined the line that stood ready to start. The catchers,
  4186	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand hunters, and beaters, the men of the regular Keddah, who stayed in
  4187	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe jungle year in and year out, sat on the backs of the elephants that
  4188	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbelonged to Petersen Sahib’s permanent force, or leaned against the
  4189	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttrees with their guns across their arms, and made fun of the drivers who
  4190	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twere going away, and laughed when the newly caught elephants broke the
  4191	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tline and ran about.
  4192	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4193	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBig Toomai went up to the clerk with Little Toomai behind him, and
  4194	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMachua Appa, the head tracker, said in an undertone to a friend of his,
  4195	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“There goes one piece of good elephant stuff at least. ‘Tis a pity to
  4196	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsend that young jungle-cock to molt in the plains.”
  4197	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4198	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tNow Petersen Sahib had ears all over him, as a man must have who listens
  4199	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto the most silent of all living things--the wild elephant. He turned
  4200	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twhere he was lying all along on Pudmini’s back and said, “What is that?
  4201	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tI did not know of a man among the plains-drivers who had wit enough to
  4202	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\trope even a dead elephant.”
  4203	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4204	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“This is not a man, but a boy. He went into the Keddah at the last
  4205	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdrive, and threw Barmao there the rope, when we were trying to get that
  4206	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tyoung calf with the blotch on his shoulder away from his mother.”
  4207	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4208	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMachua Appa pointed at Little Toomai, and Petersen Sahib looked, and
  4209	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tLittle Toomai bowed to the earth.
  4210	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4211	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“He throw a rope? He is smaller than a picket-pin. Little one, what is
  4212	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthy name?” said Petersen Sahib.
  4213	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4214	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tLittle Toomai was too frightened to speak, but Kala Nag was behind him,
  4215	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand Toomai made a sign with his hand, and the elephant caught him up in
  4216	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\this trunk and held him level with Pudmini’s forehead, in front of the
  4217	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgreat Petersen Sahib. Then Little Toomai covered his face with his
  4218	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thands, for he was only a child, and except where elephants were
  4219	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tconcerned, he was just as bashful as a child could be.
  4220	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4221	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Oho!” said Petersen Sahib, smiling underneath his mustache, “and why
  4222	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdidst thou teach thy elephant that trick? Was it to help thee steal
  4223	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgreen corn from the roofs of the houses when the ears are put out to
  4224	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdry?”
  4225	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4226	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Not green corn, Protector of the Poor,--melons,” said Little Toomai,
  4227	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand all the men sitting about broke into a roar of laughter. Most of
  4228	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthem had taught their elephants that trick when they were boys. Little
  4229	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tToomai was hanging eight feet up in the air, and he wished very much
  4230	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthat he were eight feet underground.
  4231	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4232	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“He is Toomai, my son, Sahib,” said Big Toomai, scowling. “He is a very
  4233	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbad boy, and he will end in a jail, Sahib.”
  4234	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4235	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Of that I have my doubts,” said Petersen Sahib. “A boy who can face a
  4236	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfull Keddah at his age does not end in jails. See, little one, here are
  4237	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfour annas to spend in sweetmeats because thou hast a little head under
  4238	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthat great thatch of hair. In time thou mayest become a hunter too.” Big
  4239	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tToomai scowled more than ever. “Remember, though, that Keddahs are not
  4240	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgood for children to play in,” Petersen Sahib went on.
  4241	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4242	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Must I never go there, Sahib?” asked Little Toomai with a big gasp.
  4243	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4244	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Yes.” Petersen Sahib smiled again. “When thou hast seen the elephants
  4245	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdance. That is the proper time. Come to me when thou hast seen the
  4246	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\telephants dance, and then I will let thee go into all the Keddahs.”
  4247	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4248	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThere was another roar of laughter, for that is an old joke among
  4249	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\telephant-catchers, and it means just never. There are great cleared flat
  4250	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tplaces hidden away in the forests that are called elephants’ ball-rooms,
  4251	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbut even these are only found by accident, and no man has ever seen the
  4252	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\telephants dance. When a driver boasts of his skill and bravery the other
  4253	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdrivers say, “And when didst thou see the elephants dance?”
  4254	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4255	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tKala Nag put Little Toomai down, and he bowed to the earth again and
  4256	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twent away with his father, and gave the silver four-anna piece to his
  4257	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmother, who was nursing his baby brother, and they all were put up on
  4258	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tKala Nag’s back, and the line of grunting, squealing elephants rolled
  4259	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdown the hill path to the plains. It was a very lively march on account
  4260	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof the new elephants, who gave trouble at every ford, and needed coaxing
  4261	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tor beating every other minute.
  4262	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4263	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBig Toomai prodded Kala Nag spitefully, for he was very angry, but
  4264	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tLittle Toomai was too happy to speak. Petersen Sahib had noticed him,
  4265	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand given him money, so he felt as a private soldier would feel if he
  4266	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thad been called out of the ranks and praised by his commander-in-chief.
  4267	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4268	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“What did Petersen Sahib mean by the elephant dance?” he said, at last,
  4269	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsoftly to his mother.
  4270	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4271	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBig Toomai heard him and grunted. “That thou shouldst never be one of
  4272	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthese hill buffaloes of trackers. That was what he meant. Oh, you in
  4273	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfront, what is blocking the way?”
  4274	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4275	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tAn Assamese driver, two or three elephants ahead, turned round angrily,
  4276	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcrying: “Bring up Kala Nag, and knock this youngster of mine into good
  4277	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbehavior. Why should Petersen Sahib have chosen me to go down with you
  4278	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdonkeys of the rice fields? Lay your beast alongside, Toomai, and
  4279	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlet him prod with his tusks. By all the Gods of the Hills, these new
  4280	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\telephants are possessed, or else they can smell their companions in the
  4281	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tjungle.” Kala Nag hit the new elephant in the ribs and knocked the
  4282	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twind out of him, as Big Toomai said, “We have swept the hills of wild
  4283	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\telephants at the last catch. It is only your carelessness in driving.
  4284	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMust I keep order along the whole line?”
  4285	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4286	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Hear him!” said the other driver. “We have swept the hills! Ho! Ho! You
  4287	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tare very wise, you plains people. Anyone but a mud-head who never saw
  4288	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe jungle would know that they know that the drives are ended for the
  4289	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tseason. Therefore all the wild elephants to-night will--but why should I
  4290	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twaste wisdom on a river-turtle?”
  4291	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4292	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“What will they do?” Little Toomai called out.
  4293	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4294	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Ohe, little one. Art thou there? Well, I will tell thee, for thou hast
  4295	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ta cool head. They will dance, and it behooves thy father, who has
  4296	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tswept all the hills of all the elephants, to double-chain his pickets
  4297	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto-night.”
  4298	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4299	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“What talk is this?” said Big Toomai. “For forty years, father and son,
  4300	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twe have tended elephants, and we have never heard such moonshine about
  4301	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdances.”
  4302	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4303	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Yes; but a plainsman who lives in a hut knows only the four walls
  4304	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof his hut. Well, leave thy elephants unshackled tonight and see what
  4305	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcomes. As for their dancing, I have seen the place where--Bapree-bap!
  4306	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tHow many windings has the Dihang River? Here is another ford, and we
  4307	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmust swim the calves. Stop still, you behind there.”
  4308	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4309	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tAnd in this way, talking and wrangling and splashing through the rivers,
  4310	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthey made their first march to a sort of receiving camp for the new
  4311	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\telephants. But they lost their tempers long before they got there.
  4312	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4313	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThen the elephants were chained by their hind legs to their big stumps
  4314	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof pickets, and extra ropes were fitted to the new elephants, and the
  4315	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfodder was piled before them, and the hill drivers went back to Petersen
  4316	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tSahib through the afternoon light, telling the plains drivers to be
  4317	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\textra careful that night, and laughing when the plains drivers asked the
  4318	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\treason.
  4319	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4320	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tLittle Toomai attended to Kala Nag’s supper, and as evening fell,
  4321	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twandered through the camp, unspeakably happy, in search of a tom-tom.
  4322	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tWhen an Indian child’s heart is full, he does not run about and make a
  4323	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnoise in an irregular fashion. He sits down to a sort of revel all by
  4324	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thimself. And Little Toomai had been spoken to by Petersen Sahib! If he
  4325	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thad not found what he wanted, I believe he would have been ill. But the
  4326	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsweetmeat seller in the camp lent him a little tom-tom--a drum beaten
  4327	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twith the flat of the hand--and he sat down, cross-legged, before Kala
  4328	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tNag as the stars began to come out, the tom-tom in his lap, and he
  4329	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthumped and he thumped and he thumped, and the more he thought of the
  4330	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgreat honor that had been done to him, the more he thumped, all alone
  4331	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tamong the elephant fodder. There was no tune and no words, but the
  4332	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthumping made him happy.
  4333	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4334	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe new elephants strained at their ropes, and squealed and trumpeted
  4335	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfrom time to time, and he could hear his mother in the camp hut putting
  4336	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\this small brother to sleep with an old, old song about the great God
  4337	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tShiv, who once told all the animals what they should eat. It is a very
  4338	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsoothing lullaby, and the first verse says:
  4339	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4340	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     Shiv, who poured the harvest and made the winds to blow,
  4341	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     Sitting at the doorways of a day of long ago,
  4342	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     Gave to each his portion, food and toil and fate,
  4343	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     From the King upon the guddee to the Beggar at the gate.
  4344	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t        All things made he--Shiva the Preserver.
  4345	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     Mahadeo!  Mahadeo!  He made all--
  4346	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     Thorn for the camel, fodder for the kine,
  4347	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     And mother’s heart for sleepy head, O little son of mine!
  4348	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4349	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tLittle Toomai came in with a joyous tunk-a-tunk at the end of each
  4350	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tverse, till he felt sleepy and stretched himself on the fodder at Kala
  4351	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tNag’s side. At last the elephants began to lie down one after another
  4352	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tas is their custom, till only Kala Nag at the right of the line was
  4353	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tleft standing up; and he rocked slowly from side to side, his ears put
  4354	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tforward to listen to the night wind as it blew very slowly across the
  4355	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thills. The air was full of all the night noises that, taken together,
  4356	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmake one big silence--the click of one bamboo stem against the other,
  4357	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe rustle of something alive in the undergrowth, the scratch and squawk
  4358	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof a half-waked bird (birds are awake in the night much more often than
  4359	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twe imagine), and the fall of water ever so far away. Little Toomai slept
  4360	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfor some time, and when he waked it was brilliant moonlight, and Kala
  4361	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tNag was still standing up with his ears cocked. Little Toomai turned,
  4362	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\trustling in the fodder, and watched the curve of his big back against
  4363	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thalf the stars in heaven, and while he watched he heard, so far away
  4364	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthat it sounded no more than a pinhole of noise pricked through the
  4365	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tstillness, the “hoot-toot” of a wild elephant.
  4366	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4367	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tAll the elephants in the lines jumped up as if they had been shot, and
  4368	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttheir grunts at last waked the sleeping mahouts, and they came out and
  4369	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdrove in the picket pegs with big mallets, and tightened this rope and
  4370	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tknotted that till all was quiet. One new elephant had nearly grubbed up
  4371	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\this picket, and Big Toomai took off Kala Nag’s leg chain and shackled
  4372	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthat elephant fore-foot to hind-foot, but slipped a loop of grass string
  4373	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tround Kala Nag’s leg, and told him to remember that he was tied fast. He
  4374	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tknew that he and his father and his grandfather had done the very same
  4375	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthing hundreds of times before. Kala Nag did not answer to the order
  4376	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tby gurgling, as he usually did. He stood still, looking out across the
  4377	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmoonlight, his head a little raised and his ears spread like fans, up to
  4378	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe great folds of the Garo hills.
  4379	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4380	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Tend to him if he grows restless in the night,” said Big Toomai to
  4381	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tLittle Toomai, and he went into the hut and slept. Little Toomai was
  4382	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tjust going to sleep, too, when he heard the coir string snap with a
  4383	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlittle “tang,” and Kala Nag rolled out of his pickets as slowly and as
  4384	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsilently as a cloud rolls out of the mouth of a valley. Little Toomai
  4385	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tpattered after him, barefooted, down the road in the moonlight, calling
  4386	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tunder his breath, “Kala Nag! Kala Nag! Take me with you, O Kala Nag!”
  4387	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t The elephant turned, without a sound, took three strides back to the
  4388	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tboy in the moonlight, put down his trunk, swung him up to his neck,
  4389	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand almost before Little Toomai had settled his knees, slipped into the
  4390	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tforest.
  4391	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4392	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThere was one blast of furious trumpeting from the lines, and then the
  4393	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsilence shut down on everything, and Kala Nag began to move. Sometimes
  4394	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ta tuft of high grass washed along his sides as a wave washes along the
  4395	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsides of a ship, and sometimes a cluster of wild-pepper vines would
  4396	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tscrape along his back, or a bamboo would creak where his shoulder
  4397	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttouched it. But between those times he moved absolutely without any
  4398	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsound, drifting through the thick Garo forest as though it had been
  4399	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsmoke. He was going uphill, but though Little Toomai watched the stars
  4400	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tin the rifts of the trees, he could not tell in what direction.
  4401	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4402	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThen Kala Nag reached the crest of the ascent and stopped for a minute,
  4403	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand Little Toomai could see the tops of the trees lying all speckled and
  4404	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfurry under the moonlight for miles and miles, and the blue-white mist
  4405	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tover the river in the hollow. Toomai leaned forward and looked, and he
  4406	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfelt that the forest was awake below him--awake and alive and crowded.
  4407	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tA big brown fruit-eating bat brushed past his ear; a porcupine’s quills
  4408	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\trattled in the thicket; and in the darkness between the tree stems he
  4409	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\theard a hog-bear digging hard in the moist warm earth, and snuffing as
  4410	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tit digged.
  4411	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4412	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThen the branches closed over his head again, and Kala Nag began to go
  4413	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdown into the valley--not quietly this time, but as a runaway gun goes
  4414	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdown a steep bank--in one rush. The huge limbs moved as steadily as
  4415	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tpistons, eight feet to each stride, and the wrinkled skin of the elbow
  4416	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tpoints rustled. The undergrowth on either side of him ripped with a
  4417	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnoise like torn canvas, and the saplings that he heaved away right and
  4418	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tleft with his shoulders sprang back again and banged him on the flank,
  4419	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand great trails of creepers, all matted together, hung from his tusks
  4420	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tas he threw his head from side to side and plowed out his pathway. Then
  4421	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tLittle Toomai laid himself down close to the great neck lest a swinging
  4422	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbough should sweep him to the ground, and he wished that he were back in
  4423	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe lines again.
  4424	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4425	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe grass began to get squashy, and Kala Nag’s feet sucked and squelched
  4426	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tas he put them down, and the night mist at the bottom of the valley
  4427	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tchilled Little Toomai. There was a splash and a trample, and the rush of
  4428	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\trunning water, and Kala Nag strode through the bed of a river, feeling
  4429	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\this way at each step. Above the noise of the water, as it swirled round
  4430	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe elephant’s legs, Little Toomai could hear more splashing and some
  4431	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttrumpeting both upstream and down--great grunts and angry snortings, and
  4432	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tall the mist about him seemed to be full of rolling, wavy shadows.
  4433	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4434	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Ai!” he said, half aloud, his teeth chattering. “The elephant-folk are
  4435	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tout tonight. It is the dance, then!”
  4436	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4437	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tKala Nag swashed out of the water, blew his trunk clear, and began
  4438	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tanother climb. But this time he was not alone, and he had not to make
  4439	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\this path. That was made already, six feet wide, in front of him, where
  4440	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe bent jungle-grass was trying to recover itself and stand up. Many
  4441	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\telephants must have gone that way only a few minutes before. Little
  4442	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tToomai looked back, and behind him a great wild tusker with his little
  4443	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tpig’s eyes glowing like hot coals was just lifting himself out of the
  4444	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmisty river. Then the trees closed up again, and they went on and up,
  4445	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twith trumpetings and crashings, and the sound of breaking branches on
  4446	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tevery side of them.
  4447	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4448	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tAt last Kala Nag stood still between two tree-trunks at the very top
  4449	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof the hill. They were part of a circle of trees that grew round an
  4450	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tirregular space of some three or four acres, and in all that space, as
  4451	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tLittle Toomai could see, the ground had been trampled down as hard as
  4452	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ta brick floor. Some trees grew in the center of the clearing, but their
  4453	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbark was rubbed away, and the white wood beneath showed all shiny and
  4454	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tpolished in the patches of moonlight. There were creepers hanging from
  4455	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe upper branches, and the bells of the flowers of the creepers, great
  4456	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twaxy white things like convolvuluses, hung down fast asleep. But
  4457	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twithin the limits of the clearing there was not a single blade of
  4458	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgreen--nothing but the trampled earth.
  4459	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4460	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe moonlight showed it all iron gray, except where some elephants
  4461	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tstood upon it, and their shadows were inky black. Little Toomai looked,
  4462	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tholding his breath, with his eyes starting out of his head, and as he
  4463	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlooked, more and more and more elephants swung out into the open from
  4464	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbetween the tree trunks. Little Toomai could only count up to ten, and
  4465	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\the counted again and again on his fingers till he lost count of the
  4466	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttens, and his head began to swim. Outside the clearing he could hear
  4467	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthem crashing in the undergrowth as they worked their way up the
  4468	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thillside, but as soon as they were within the circle of the tree trunks
  4469	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthey moved like ghosts.
  4470	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4471	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThere were white-tusked wild males, with fallen leaves and nuts and
  4472	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttwigs lying in the wrinkles of their necks and the folds of their ears;
  4473	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfat, slow-footed she-elephants, with restless, little pinky black
  4474	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcalves only three or four feet high running under their stomachs; young
  4475	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\telephants with their tusks just beginning to show, and very proud of
  4476	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthem; lanky, scraggy old-maid elephants, with their hollow anxious
  4477	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfaces, and trunks like rough bark; savage old bull elephants, scarred
  4478	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfrom shoulder to flank with great weals and cuts of bygone fights,
  4479	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand the caked dirt of their solitary mud baths dropping from their
  4480	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tshoulders; and there was one with a broken tusk and the marks of the
  4481	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfull-stroke, the terrible drawing scrape, of a tiger’s claws on his
  4482	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tside.
  4483	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4484	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThey were standing head to head, or walking to and fro across the ground
  4485	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tin couples, or rocking and swaying all by themselves--scores and scores
  4486	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof elephants.
  4487	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4488	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tToomai knew that so long as he lay still on Kala Nag’s neck nothing
  4489	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twould happen to him, for even in the rush and scramble of a Keddah drive
  4490	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ta wild elephant does not reach up with his trunk and drag a man off the
  4491	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tneck of a tame elephant. And these elephants were not thinking of men
  4492	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthat night. Once they started and put their ears forward when they heard
  4493	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe chinking of a leg iron in the forest, but it was Pudmini, Petersen
  4494	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tSahib’s pet elephant, her chain snapped short off, grunting, snuffling
  4495	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tup the hillside. She must have broken her pickets and come straight from
  4496	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tPetersen Sahib’s camp; and Little Toomai saw another elephant, one that
  4497	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\the did not know, with deep rope galls on his back and breast. He, too,
  4498	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmust have run away from some camp in the hills about.
  4499	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4500	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tAt last there was no sound of any more elephants moving in the forest,
  4501	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand Kala Nag rolled out from his station between the trees and went into
  4502	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe middle of the crowd, clucking and gurgling, and all the elephants
  4503	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbegan to talk in their own tongue, and to move about.
  4504	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4505	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tStill lying down, Little Toomai looked down upon scores and scores of
  4506	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbroad backs, and wagging ears, and tossing trunks, and little rolling
  4507	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\teyes. He heard the click of tusks as they crossed other tusks by
  4508	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\taccident, and the dry rustle of trunks twined together, and the chafing
  4509	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof enormous sides and shoulders in the crowd, and the incessant flick
  4510	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand hissh of the great tails. Then a cloud came over the moon, and he
  4511	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsat in black darkness. But the quiet, steady hustling and pushing and
  4512	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgurgling went on just the same. He knew that there were elephants all
  4513	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tround Kala Nag, and that there was no chance of backing him out of the
  4514	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tassembly; so he set his teeth and shivered. In a Keddah at least there
  4515	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twas torchlight and shouting, but here he was all alone in the dark, and
  4516	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tonce a trunk came up and touched him on the knee.
  4517	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4518	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThen an elephant trumpeted, and they all took it up for five or ten
  4519	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tterrible seconds. The dew from the trees above spattered down like rain
  4520	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ton the unseen backs, and a dull booming noise began, not very loud at
  4521	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfirst, and Little Toomai could not tell what it was. But it grew and
  4522	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgrew, and Kala Nag lifted up one forefoot and then the other, and
  4523	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbrought them down on the ground--one-two, one-two, as steadily as
  4524	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttrip-hammers. The elephants were stamping all together now, and it
  4525	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsounded like a war drum beaten at the mouth of a cave. The dew fell from
  4526	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe trees till there was no more left to fall, and the booming went on,
  4527	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand the ground rocked and shivered, and Little Toomai put his hands up
  4528	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto his ears to shut out the sound. But it was all one gigantic jar that
  4529	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tran through him--this stamp of hundreds of heavy feet on the raw earth.
  4530	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tOnce or twice he could feel Kala Nag and all the others surge forward
  4531	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ta few strides, and the thumping would change to the crushing sound of
  4532	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tjuicy green things being bruised, but in a minute or two the boom
  4533	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof feet on hard earth began again. A tree was creaking and groaning
  4534	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsomewhere near him. He put out his arm and felt the bark, but Kala Nag
  4535	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmoved forward, still tramping, and he could not tell where he was in the
  4536	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tclearing. There was no sound from the elephants, except once, when two
  4537	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tor three little calves squeaked together. Then he heard a thump and a
  4538	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tshuffle, and the booming went on. It must have lasted fully two hours,
  4539	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand Little Toomai ached in every nerve, but he knew by the smell of the
  4540	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnight air that the dawn was coming.
  4541	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4542	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe morning broke in one sheet of pale yellow behind the green hills,
  4543	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand the booming stopped with the first ray, as though the light had
  4544	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbeen an order. Before Little Toomai had got the ringing out of his head,
  4545	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbefore even he had shifted his position, there was not an elephant in
  4546	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsight except Kala Nag, Pudmini, and the elephant with the rope-galls,
  4547	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand there was neither sign nor rustle nor whisper down the hillsides to
  4548	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tshow where the others had gone.
  4549	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4550	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tLittle Toomai stared again and again. The clearing, as he remembered it,
  4551	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thad grown in the night. More trees stood in the middle of it, but the
  4552	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tundergrowth and the jungle grass at the sides had been rolled back.
  4553	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tLittle Toomai stared once more. Now he understood the trampling. The
  4554	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\telephants had stamped out more room--had stamped the thick grass and
  4555	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tjuicy cane to trash, the trash into slivers, the slivers into tiny
  4556	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfibers, and the fibers into hard earth.
  4557	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4558	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Wah!” said Little Toomai, and his eyes were very heavy. “Kala Nag, my
  4559	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlord, let us keep by Pudmini and go to Petersen Sahib’s camp, or I shall
  4560	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdrop from thy neck.”
  4561	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4562	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe third elephant watched the two go away, snorted, wheeled round, and
  4563	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttook his own path. He may have belonged to some little native king’s
  4564	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\testablishment, fifty or sixty or a hundred miles away.
  4565	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4566	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tTwo hours later, as Petersen Sahib was eating early breakfast, his
  4567	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\telephants, who had been double chained that night, began to trumpet, and
  4568	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tPudmini, mired to the shoulders, with Kala Nag, very footsore, shambled
  4569	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tinto the camp. Little Toomai’s face was gray and pinched, and his
  4570	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thair was full of leaves and drenched with dew, but he tried to salute
  4571	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tPetersen Sahib, and cried faintly: “The dance--the elephant dance! I
  4572	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thave seen it, and--I die!” As Kala Nag sat down, he slid off his neck in
  4573	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ta dead faint.
  4574	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4575	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBut, since native children have no nerves worth speaking of, in two
  4576	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thours he was lying very contentedly in Petersen Sahib’s hammock with
  4577	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tPetersen Sahib’s shooting-coat under his head, and a glass of warm milk,
  4578	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ta little brandy, with a dash of quinine, inside of him, and while the
  4579	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\told hairy, scarred hunters of the jungles sat three deep before him,
  4580	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlooking at him as though he were a spirit, he told his tale in short
  4581	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twords, as a child will, and wound up with:
  4582	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4583	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Now, if I lie in one word, send men to see, and they will find that the
  4584	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\telephant folk have trampled down more room in their dance-room, and
  4585	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthey will find ten and ten, and many times ten, tracks leading to that
  4586	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdance-room. They made more room with their feet. I have seen it. Kala
  4587	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tNag took me, and I saw. Also Kala Nag is very leg-weary!”
  4588	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4589	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tLittle Toomai lay back and slept all through the long afternoon and into
  4590	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe twilight, and while he slept Petersen Sahib and Machua Appa followed
  4591	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe track of the two elephants for fifteen miles across the hills.
  4592	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tPetersen Sahib had spent eighteen years in catching elephants, and he
  4593	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thad only once before found such a dance-place. Machua Appa had no need
  4594	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto look twice at the clearing to see what had been done there, or to
  4595	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tscratch with his toe in the packed, rammed earth.
  4596	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4597	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“The child speaks truth,” said he. “All this was done last night, and
  4598	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tI have counted seventy tracks crossing the river. See, Sahib, where
  4599	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tPudmini’s leg-iron cut the bark of that tree! Yes; she was there too.”
  4600	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4601	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThey looked at one another and up and down, and they wondered. For the
  4602	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tways of elephants are beyond the wit of any man, black or white, to
  4603	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfathom.
  4604	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4605	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Forty years and five,” said Machua Appa, “have I followed my lord, the
  4606	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\telephant, but never have I heard that any child of man had seen what
  4607	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthis child has seen. By all the Gods of the Hills, it is--what can we
  4608	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsay?” and he shook his head.
  4609	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4610	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tWhen they got back to camp it was time for the evening meal. Petersen
  4611	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tSahib ate alone in his tent, but he gave orders that the camp should
  4612	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thave two sheep and some fowls, as well as a double ration of flour and
  4613	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\trice and salt, for he knew that there would be a feast.
  4614	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4615	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBig Toomai had come up hotfoot from the camp in the plains to search for
  4616	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\this son and his elephant, and now that he had found them he looked at
  4617	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthem as though he were afraid of them both. And there was a feast by
  4618	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe blazing campfires in front of the lines of picketed elephants,
  4619	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand Little Toomai was the hero of it all. And the big brown elephant
  4620	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcatchers, the trackers and drivers and ropers, and the men who know all
  4621	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe secrets of breaking the wildest elephants, passed him from one to
  4622	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe other, and they marked his forehead with blood from the breast of a
  4623	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnewly killed jungle-cock, to show that he was a forester, initiated and
  4624	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfree of all the jungles.
  4625	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4626	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tAnd at last, when the flames died down, and the red light of the logs
  4627	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmade the elephants look as though they had been dipped in blood too,
  4628	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMachua Appa, the head of all the drivers of all the Keddahs--Machua
  4629	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tAppa, Petersen Sahib’s other self, who had never seen a made road in
  4630	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tforty years: Machua Appa, who was so great that he had no other name
  4631	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthan Machua Appa,--leaped to his feet, with Little Toomai held high in
  4632	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe air above his head, and shouted: “Listen, my brothers. Listen, too,
  4633	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tyou my lords in the lines there, for I, Machua Appa, am speaking! This
  4634	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlittle one shall no more be called Little Toomai, but Toomai of the
  4635	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tElephants, as his great-grandfather was called before him. What never
  4636	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tman has seen he has seen through the long night, and the favor of the
  4637	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\telephant-folk and of the Gods of the Jungles is with him. He shall
  4638	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbecome a great tracker. He shall become greater than I, even I, Machua
  4639	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tAppa! He shall follow the new trail, and the stale trail, and the mixed
  4640	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttrail, with a clear eye! He shall take no harm in the Keddah when he
  4641	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\truns under their bellies to rope the wild tuskers; and if he slips
  4642	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbefore the feet of the charging bull elephant, the bull elephant
  4643	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tshall know who he is and shall not crush him. Aihai! my lords in the
  4644	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tchains,”--he whirled up the line of pickets--“here is the little one
  4645	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthat has seen your dances in your hidden places,--the sight that never
  4646	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tman saw! Give him honor, my lords! Salaam karo, my children. Make your
  4647	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsalute to Toomai of the Elephants! Gunga Pershad, ahaa! Hira Guj, Birchi
  4648	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tGuj, Kuttar Guj, ahaa! Pudmini,--thou hast seen him at the dance, and
  4649	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthou too, Kala Nag, my pearl among elephants!--ahaa! Together! To Toomai
  4650	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof the Elephants. Barrao!”
  4651	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4652	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tAnd at that last wild yell the whole line flung up their trunks till the
  4653	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttips touched their foreheads, and broke out into the full salute--the
  4654	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcrashing trumpet-peal that only the Viceroy of India hears, the Salaamut
  4655	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof the Keddah.
  4656	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4657	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBut it was all for the sake of Little Toomai, who had seen what never
  4658	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tman had seen before--the dance of the elephants at night and alone in

  4721	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmen and savage horses from somewhere at the back of Central Asia. Every

  4726	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tMy tent lay far away from the camel lines, and I thought it was safe.

  4736	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tknow how many camels might have got loose, and before long I was out of
  4737	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsight of the camp, plowing my way through the mud.
  4738	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4739	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tAt last I fell over the tail-end of a gun, and by that knew I was
  4740	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsomewhere near the artillery lines where the cannon were stacked at
  4741	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnight. As I did not want to plowter about any more in the drizzle and
  4742	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe dark, I put my waterproof over the muzzle of one gun, and made a
  4743	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsort of wigwam with two or three rammers that I found, and lay along the
  4744	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttail of another gun, wondering where Vixen had got to, and where I might
  4745	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbe.
  4746	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4747	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tJust as I was getting ready to go to sleep I heard a jingle of harness
  4748	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand a grunt, and a mule passed me shaking his wet ears. He belonged to
  4749	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ta screw-gun battery, for I could hear the rattle of the straps and rings
  4750	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand chains and things on his saddle pad. The screw-guns are tiny little
  4751	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcannon made in two pieces, that are screwed together when the time comes
  4752	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto use them. They are taken up mountains, anywhere that a mule can find
  4753	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ta road, and they are very useful for fighting in rocky country.
  4754	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4755	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBehind the mule there was a camel, with his big soft feet squelching
  4756	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand slipping in the mud, and his neck bobbing to and fro like a
  4757	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tstrayed hen’s. Luckily, I knew enough of beast language--not wild-beast
  4758	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlanguage, but camp-beast language, of course--from the natives to know
  4759	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twhat he was saying.
  4760	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4761	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tHe must have been the one that flopped into my tent, for he called to
  4762	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe mule, “What shall I do? Where shall I go? I have fought with a white
  4763	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthing that waved, and it took a stick and hit me on the neck.” (That was
  4764	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmy broken tent pole, and I was very glad to know it.) “Shall we run on?”
  4765	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4766	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Oh, it was you,” said the mule, “you and your friends, that have
  4767	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbeen disturbing the camp? All right. You’ll be beaten for this in the
  4768	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmorning. But I may as well give you something on account now.”
  4769	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4770	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tI heard the harness jingle as the mule backed and caught the camel
  4771	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttwo kicks in the ribs that rang like a drum. “Another time,” he said,
  4772	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“you’ll know better than to run through a mule battery at night,
  4773	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tshouting `Thieves and fire!’ Sit down, and keep your silly neck quiet.”
  4774	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4775	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe camel doubled up camel-fashion, like a two-foot rule, and sat down
  4776	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twhimpering. There was a regular beat of hoofs in the darkness, and a big
  4777	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttroop-horse cantered up as steadily as though he were on parade, jumped
  4778	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ta gun tail, and landed close to the mule.
  4779	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4780	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“It’s disgraceful,” he said, blowing out his nostrils. “Those camels
  4781	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thave racketed through our lines again--the third time this week. How’s a
  4782	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thorse to keep his condition if he isn’t allowed to sleep. Who’s here?”
  4783	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4784	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I’m the breech-piece mule of number two gun of the First Screw
  4785	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBattery,” said the mule, “and the other’s one of your friends. He’s
  4786	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twaked me up too. Who are you?”
  4787	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4788	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Number Fifteen, E troop, Ninth Lancers--Dick Cunliffe’s horse. Stand
  4789	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tover a little, there.”
  4790	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4791	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Oh, beg your pardon,” said the mule. “It’s too dark to see much. Aren’t
  4792	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthese camels too sickening for anything? I walked out of my lines to get
  4793	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ta little peace and quiet here.”
  4794	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4795	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“My lords,” said the camel humbly, “we dreamed bad dreams in the night,
  4796	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand we were very much afraid. I am only a baggage camel of the 39th
  4797	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tNative Infantry, and I am not as brave as you are, my lords.”
  4798	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4799	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Then why didn’t you stay and carry baggage for the 39th Native
  4800	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tInfantry, instead of running all round the camp?” said the mule.
  4801	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4802	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“They were such very bad dreams,” said the camel. “I am sorry. Listen!
  4803	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tWhat is that? Shall we run on again?”
  4804	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4805	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Sit down,” said the mule, “or you’ll snap your long stick-legs between
  4806	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe guns.” He cocked one ear and listened. “Bullocks!” he said. “Gun
  4807	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbullocks. On my word, you and your friends have waked the camp very
  4808	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthoroughly. It takes a good deal of prodding to put up a gun-bullock.”
  4809	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4810	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tI heard a chain dragging along the ground, and a yoke of the great sulky
  4811	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twhite bullocks that drag the heavy siege guns when the elephants won’t
  4812	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgo any nearer to the firing, came shouldering along together. And almost
  4813	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tstepping on the chain was another battery mule, calling wildly for
  4814	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Billy.”
  4815	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4816	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“That’s one of our recruits,” said the old mule to the troop horse.
  4817	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“He’s calling for me. Here, youngster, stop squealing. The dark never
  4818	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thurt anybody yet.”
  4819	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4820	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe gun-bullocks lay down together and began chewing the cud, but the
  4821	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tyoung mule huddled close to Billy.
  4822	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4823	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Things!” he said. “Fearful and horrible, Billy! They came into our
  4824	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlines while we were asleep. D’you think they’ll kill us?”
  4825	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4826	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I’ve a very great mind to give you a number-one kicking,” said Billy.
  4827	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“The idea of a fourteen-hand mule with your training disgracing the
  4828	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbattery before this gentleman!”
  4829	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4830	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Gently, gently!” said the troop-horse. “Remember they are always like
  4831	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthis to begin with. The first time I ever saw a man (it was in Australia
  4832	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twhen I was a three-year-old) I ran for half a day, and if I’d seen a
  4833	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcamel, I should have been running still.”
  4834	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4835	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tNearly all our horses for the English cavalry are brought to India from
  4836	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tAustralia, and are broken in by the troopers themselves.
  4837	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4838	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“True enough,” said Billy. “Stop shaking, youngster. The first time
  4839	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthey put the full harness with all its chains on my back I stood on
  4840	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmy forelegs and kicked every bit of it off. I hadn’t learned the real
  4841	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tscience of kicking then, but the battery said they had never seen
  4842	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tanything like it.”
  4843	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4844	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“But this wasn’t harness or anything that jingled,” said the young mule.
  4845	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“You know I don’t mind that now, Billy. It was Things like trees, and
  4846	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthey fell up and down the lines and bubbled; and my head-rope broke, and
  4847	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tI couldn’t find my driver, and I couldn’t find you, Billy, so I ran off
  4848	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twith--with these gentlemen.”
  4849	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4850	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“H’m!” said Billy. “As soon as I heard the camels were loose I came away
  4851	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ton my own account. When a battery--a screw-gun mule calls gun-bullocks
  4852	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgentlemen, he must be very badly shaken up. Who are you fellows on the
  4853	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tground there?”
  4854	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4855	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe gun bullocks rolled their cuds, and answered both together: “The
  4856	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tseventh yoke of the first gun of the Big Gun Battery. We were asleep
  4857	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twhen the camels came, but when we were trampled on we got up and walked
  4858	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\taway. It is better to lie quiet in the mud than to be disturbed on good
  4859	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbedding. We told your friend here that there was nothing to be afraid
  4860	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof, but he knew so much that he thought otherwise. Wah!”
  4861	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4862	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThey went on chewing.
  4863	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4864	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“That comes of being afraid,” said Billy. “You get laughed at by
  4865	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgun-bullocks. I hope you like it, young un.”
  4866	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4867	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe young mule’s teeth snapped, and I heard him say something about not
  4868	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbeing afraid of any beefy old bullock in the world. But the bullocks
  4869	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tonly clicked their horns together and went on chewing.
  4870	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4871	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Now, don’t be angry after you’ve been afraid. That’s the worst kind
  4872	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof cowardice,” said the troop-horse. “Anybody can be forgiven for being
  4873	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tscared in the night, I think, if they see things they don’t understand.
  4874	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tWe’ve broken out of our pickets, again and again, four hundred and fifty
  4875	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof us, just because a new recruit got to telling tales of whip snakes at
  4876	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thome in Australia till we were scared to death of the loose ends of our
  4877	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thead-ropes.”
  4878	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4879	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“That’s all very well in camp,” said Billy. “I’m not above stampeding
  4880	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmyself, for the fun of the thing, when I haven’t been out for a day or
  4881	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttwo. But what do you do on active service?”
  4882	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4883	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Oh, that’s quite another set of new shoes,” said the troop horse. “Dick
  4884	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tCunliffe’s on my back then, and drives his knees into me, and all I have
  4885	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto do is to watch where I am putting my feet, and to keep my hind legs
  4886	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twell under me, and be bridle-wise.”
  4887	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4888	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“What’s bridle-wise?” said the young mule.
  4889	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4890	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“By the Blue Gums of the Back Blocks,” snorted the troop-horse, “do you
  4891	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmean to say that you aren’t taught to be bridle-wise in your business?
  4892	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tHow can you do anything, unless you can spin round at once when the
  4893	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\trein is pressed on your neck? It means life or death to your man, and of
  4894	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcourse that’s life and death to you. Get round with your hind legs under
  4895	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tyou the instant you feel the rein on your neck. If you haven’t room to
  4896	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tswing round, rear up a little and come round on your hind legs. That’s
  4897	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbeing bridle-wise.”
  4898	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4899	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“We aren’t taught that way,” said Billy the mule stiffly. “We’re taught
  4900	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto obey the man at our head: step off when he says so, and step in when
  4901	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\the says so. I suppose it comes to the same thing. Now, with all this
  4902	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfine fancy business and rearing, which must be very bad for your hocks,
  4903	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twhat do you do?”
  4904	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4905	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“That depends,” said the troop-horse. “Generally I have to go in among a
  4906	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlot of yelling, hairy men with knives--long shiny knives, worse than
  4907	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe farrier’s knives--and I have to take care that Dick’s boot is just
  4908	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttouching the next man’s boot without crushing it. I can see Dick’s lance
  4909	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto the right of my right eye, and I know I’m safe. I shouldn’t care to
  4910	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbe the man or horse that stood up to Dick and me when we’re in a hurry.”
  4911	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4912	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Don’t the knives hurt?” said the young mule.
  4913	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4914	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Well, I got one cut across the chest once, but that wasn’t Dick’s
  4915	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfault--”
  4916	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4917	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“A lot I should have cared whose fault it was, if it hurt!” said the
  4918	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tyoung mule.
  4919	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4920	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“You must,” said the troop horse. “If you don’t trust your man, you may
  4921	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tas well run away at once. That’s what some of our horses do, and I don’t
  4922	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tblame them. As I was saying, it wasn’t Dick’s fault. The man was lying
  4923	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ton the ground, and I stretched myself not to tread on him, and he
  4924	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tslashed up at me. Next time I have to go over a man lying down I shall
  4925	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tstep on him--hard.”
  4926	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4927	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“H’m!” said Billy. “It sounds very foolish. Knives are dirty things
  4928	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tat any time. The proper thing to do is to climb up a mountain with a
  4929	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twell-balanced saddle, hang on by all four feet and your ears too, and
  4930	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcreep and crawl and wriggle along, till you come out hundreds of feet
  4931	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tabove anyone else on a ledge where there’s just room enough for your
  4932	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thoofs. Then you stand still and keep quiet--never ask a man to hold your
  4933	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thead, young un--keep quiet while the guns are being put together, and
  4934	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthen you watch the little poppy shells drop down into the tree-tops ever
  4935	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tso far below.”
  4936	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4937	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Don’t you ever trip?” said the troop-horse.
  4938	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4939	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“They say that when a mule trips you can split a hen’s ear,” said Billy.
  4940	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Now and again perhaps a badly packed saddle will upset a mule, but it’s
  4941	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tvery seldom. I wish I could show you our business. It’s beautiful. Why,
  4942	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tit took me three years to find out what the men were driving at. The
  4943	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tscience of the thing is never to show up against the sky line, because,
  4944	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tif you do, you may get fired at. Remember that, young un. Always keep
  4945	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thidden as much as possible, even if you have to go a mile out of your
  4946	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tway. I lead the battery when it comes to that sort of climbing.”
  4947	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4948	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Fired at without the chance of running into the people who are firing!”
  4949	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t said the troop-horse, thinking hard. “I couldn’t stand that. I should
  4950	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twant to charge--with Dick.”
  4951	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4952	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Oh, no, you wouldn’t. You know that as soon as the guns are in
  4953	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tposition they’ll do all the charging. That’s scientific and neat. But
  4954	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tknives--pah!”
  4955	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4956	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe baggage-camel had been bobbing his head to and fro for some time
  4957	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tpast, anxious to get a word in edgewise. Then I heard him say, as he
  4958	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcleared his throat, nervously:
  4959	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4960	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I--I--I have fought a little, but not in that climbing way or that
  4961	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\trunning way.”
  4962	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4963	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“No. Now you mention it,” said Billy, “you don’t look as though you were
  4964	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmade for climbing or running--much. Well, how was it, old Hay-bales?”
  4965	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4966	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“The proper way,” said the camel. “We all sat down--”
  4967	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4968	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Oh, my crupper and breastplate!” said the troop-horse under his breath.
  4969	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Sat down!”
  4970	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4971	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“We sat down--a hundred of us,” the camel went on, “in a big square, and
  4972	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe men piled our packs and saddles, outside the square, and they fired
  4973	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tover our backs, the men did, on all sides of the square.”
  4974	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4975	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“What sort of men? Any men that came along?” said the troop-horse. “They
  4976	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tteach us in riding school to lie down and let our masters fire across
  4977	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tus, but Dick Cunliffe is the only man I’d trust to do that. It tickles
  4978	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmy girths, and, besides, I can’t see with my head on the ground.”
  4979	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4980	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“What does it matter who fires across you?” said the camel. “There are
  4981	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tplenty of men and plenty of other camels close by, and a great many
  4982	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tclouds of smoke. I am not frightened then. I sit still and wait.”
  4983	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4984	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“And yet,” said Billy, “you dream bad dreams and upset the camp at
  4985	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnight. Well, well! Before I’d lie down, not to speak of sitting down,
  4986	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand let a man fire across me, my heels and his head would have something
  4987	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto say to each other. Did you ever hear anything so awful as that?”
  4988	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4989	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThere was a long silence, and then one of the gun bullocks lifted up his
  4990	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbig head and said, “This is very foolish indeed. There is only one way
  4991	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof fighting.”
  4992	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4993	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Oh, go on,” said Billy. “Please don’t mind me. I suppose you fellows
  4994	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfight standing on your tails?”
  4995	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  4996	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Only one way,” said the two together. (They must have been twins.)
  4997	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“This is that way. To put all twenty yoke of us to the big gun as soon
  4998	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tas Two Tails trumpets.” (“Two Tails” is camp slang for the elephant.)
  4999	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5000	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“What does Two Tails trumpet for?” said the young mule.
  5001	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5002	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“To show that he is not going any nearer to the smoke on the other
  5003	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tside. Two Tails is a great coward. Then we tug the big gun all
  5004	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttogether--Heya--Hullah! Heeyah! Hullah! We do not climb like cats nor
  5005	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\trun like calves. We go across the level plain, twenty yoke of us, till
  5006	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twe are unyoked again, and we graze while the big guns talk across the
  5007	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tplain to some town with mud walls, and pieces of the wall fall out, and
  5008	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe dust goes up as though many cattle were coming home.”
  5009	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5010	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Oh! And you choose that time for grazing?” said the young mule.
  5011	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5012	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“That time or any other. Eating is always good. We eat till we are yoked
  5013	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tup again and tug the gun back to where Two Tails is waiting for it.
  5014	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tSometimes there are big guns in the city that speak back, and some of
  5015	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tus are killed, and then there is all the more grazing for those that are
  5016	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tleft. This is Fate. None the less, Two Tails is a great coward. That is
  5017	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe proper way to fight. We are brothers from Hapur. Our father was a
  5018	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsacred bull of Shiva. We have spoken.”
  5019	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5020	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Well, I’ve certainly learned something tonight,” said the troop-horse.
  5021	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Do you gentlemen of the screw-gun battery feel inclined to eat when you
  5022	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tare being fired at with big guns, and Two Tails is behind you?”
  5023	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5024	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“About as much as we feel inclined to sit down and let men sprawl all
  5025	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tover us, or run into people with knives. I never heard such stuff. A
  5026	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmountain ledge, a well-balanced load, a driver you can trust to let you
  5027	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tpick your own way, and I’m your mule. But--the other things--no!” said
  5028	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBilly, with a stamp of his foot.
  5029	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5030	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Of course,” said the troop horse, “everyone is not made in the same
  5031	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tway, and I can quite see that your family, on your father’s side, would
  5032	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfail to understand a great many things.”
  5033	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5034	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Never you mind my family on my father’s side,” said Billy angrily, for
  5035	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tevery mule hates to be reminded that his father was a donkey. “My father
  5036	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twas a Southern gentleman, and he could pull down and bite and kick into
  5037	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\trags every horse he came across. Remember that, you big brown Brumby!”
  5038	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5039	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBrumby means wild horse without any breeding. Imagine the feelings of
  5040	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tSunol if a car-horse called her a “skate,” and you can imagine how the
  5041	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tAustralian horse felt. I saw the white of his eye glitter in the dark.
  5042	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5043	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“See here, you son of an imported Malaga jackass,” he said between
  5044	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\this teeth, “I’d have you know that I’m related on my mother’s side to
  5045	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tCarbine, winner of the Melbourne Cup, and where I come from we aren’t
  5046	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\taccustomed to being ridden over roughshod by any parrot-mouthed,
  5047	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tpig-headed mule in a pop-gun pea-shooter battery. Are you ready?”
  5048	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5049	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“On your hind legs!” squealed Billy. They both reared up facing each
  5050	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tother, and I was expecting a furious fight, when a gurgly, rumbly
  5051	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tvoice, called out of the darkness to the right--“Children, what are you
  5052	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfighting about there? Be quiet.”
  5053	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5054	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBoth beasts dropped down with a snort of disgust, for neither horse nor
  5055	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmule can bear to listen to an elephant’s voice.
  5056	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5057	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“It’s Two Tails!” said the troop-horse. “I can’t stand him. A tail at
  5058	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\teach end isn’t fair!”
  5059	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5060	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“My feelings exactly,” said Billy, crowding into the troop-horse for
  5061	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcompany. “We’re very alike in some things.”
  5062	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5063	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I suppose we’ve inherited them from our mothers,” said the troop horse.
  5064	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“It’s not worth quarreling about. Hi! Two Tails, are you tied up?”
  5065	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5066	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Yes,” said Two Tails, with a laugh all up his trunk. “I’m picketed for
  5067	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe night. I’ve heard what you fellows have been saying. But don’t be
  5068	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tafraid. I’m not coming over.”
  5069	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5070	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe bullocks and the camel said, half aloud, “Afraid of Two Tails--what
  5071	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnonsense!” And the bullocks went on, “We are sorry that you heard, but
  5072	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tit is true. Two Tails, why are you afraid of the guns when they fire?”
  5073	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5074	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Well,” said Two Tails, rubbing one hind leg against the other, exactly
  5075	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlike a little boy saying a poem, “I don’t quite know whether you’d
  5076	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tunderstand.”
  5077	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5078	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“We don’t, but we have to pull the guns,” said the bullocks.
  5079	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5080	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I know it, and I know you are a good deal braver than you think
  5081	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tyou are. But it’s different with me. My battery captain called me a
  5082	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tPachydermatous Anachronism the other day.”
  5083	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5084	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“That’s another way of fighting, I suppose?” said Billy, who was
  5085	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\trecovering his spirits.
  5086	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5087	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“You don’t know what that means, of course, but I do. It means betwixt
  5088	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand between, and that is just where I am. I can see inside my head what
  5089	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twill happen when a shell bursts, and you bullocks can’t.”
  5090	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5091	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I can,” said the troop-horse. “At least a little bit. I try not to
  5092	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthink about it.”
  5093	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5094	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I can see more than you, and I do think about it. I know there’s a
  5095	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgreat deal of me to take care of, and I know that nobody knows how to
  5096	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcure me when I’m sick. All they can do is to stop my driver’s pay till I
  5097	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tget well, and I can’t trust my driver.”
  5098	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5099	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Ah!” said the troop horse. “That explains it. I can trust Dick.”
  5100	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5101	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“You could put a whole regiment of Dicks on my back without making me
  5102	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfeel any better. I know just enough to be uncomfortable, and not enough
  5103	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto go on in spite of it.”
  5104	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5105	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“We do not understand,” said the bullocks.
  5106	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5107	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I know you don’t. I’m not talking to you. You don’t know what blood
  5108	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tis.”
  5109	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5110	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“We do,” said the bullocks. “It is red stuff that soaks into the ground
  5111	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand smells.”
  5112	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5113	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe troop-horse gave a kick and a bound and a snort.
  5114	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5115	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Don’t talk of it,” he said. “I can smell it now, just thinking of it.
  5116	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tIt makes me want to run--when I haven’t Dick on my back.”
  5117	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5118	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“But it is not here,” said the camel and the bullocks. “Why are you so
  5119	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tstupid?”
  5120	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5121	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“It’s vile stuff,” said Billy. “I don’t want to run, but I don’t want to
  5122	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttalk about it.”
  5123	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5124	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“There you are!” said Two Tails, waving his tail to explain.
  5125	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5126	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Surely. Yes, we have been here all night,” said the bullocks.
  5127	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5128	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tTwo Tails stamped his foot till the iron ring on it jingled. “Oh, I’m
  5129	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnot talking to you. You can’t see inside your heads.”
  5130	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5131	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“No. We see out of our four eyes,” said the bullocks. “We see straight
  5132	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tin front of us.”
  5133	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5134	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“If I could do that and nothing else, you wouldn’t be needed to pull the
  5135	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbig guns at all. If I was like my captain--he can see things inside his
  5136	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thead before the firing begins, and he shakes all over, but he knows too
  5137	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmuch to run away--if I was like him I could pull the guns. But if I were
  5138	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tas wise as all that I should never be here. I should be a king in the
  5139	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tforest, as I used to be, sleeping half the day and bathing when I liked.
  5140	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tI haven’t had a good bath for a month.”
  5141	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5142	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“That’s all very fine,” said Billy. “But giving a thing a long name
  5143	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdoesn’t make it any better.”
  5144	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5145	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“H’sh!” said the troop horse. “I think I understand what Two Tails
  5146	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmeans.”
  5147	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5148	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“You’ll understand better in a minute,” said Two Tails angrily. “Now you
  5149	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tjust explain to me why you don’t like this!”
  5150	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5151	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tHe began trumpeting furiously at the top of his trumpet.
  5152	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5153	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Stop that!” said Billy and the troop horse together, and I could
  5154	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thear them stamp and shiver. An elephant’s trumpeting is always nasty,
  5155	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tespecially on a dark night.
  5156	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5157	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I shan’t stop,” said Two Tails. “Won’t you explain that, please?
  5158	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tHhrrmph! Rrrt! Rrrmph! Rrrhha!” Then he stopped suddenly, and I heard
  5159	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ta little whimper in the dark, and knew that Vixen had found me at last.
  5160	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tShe knew as well as I did that if there is one thing in the world the
  5161	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\telephant is more afraid of than another it is a little barking dog. So
  5162	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tshe stopped to bully Two Tails in his pickets, and yapped round his big
  5163	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tfeet. Two Tails shuffled and squeaked. “Go away, little dog!” he said.
  5164	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Don’t snuff at my ankles, or I’ll kick at you. Good little dog--nice
  5165	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlittle doggie, then! Go home, you yelping little beast! Oh, why doesn’t
  5166	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsomeone take her away? She’ll bite me in a minute.”
  5167	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5168	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Seems to me,” said Billy to the troop horse, “that our friend Two Tails
  5169	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tis afraid of most things. Now, if I had a full meal for every dog I’ve
  5170	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tkicked across the parade-ground I should be as fat as Two Tails nearly.”
  5171	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5172	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tI whistled, and Vixen ran up to me, muddy all over, and licked my nose,
  5173	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand told me a long tale about hunting for me all through the camp. I
  5174	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnever let her know that I understood beast talk, or she would have
  5175	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttaken all sorts of liberties. So I buttoned her into the breast of my
  5176	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tovercoat, and Two Tails shuffled and stamped and growled to himself.
  5177	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5178	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Extraordinary! Most extraordinary!” he said. “It runs in our family.
  5179	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tNow, where has that nasty little beast gone to?”
  5180	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5181	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tI heard him feeling about with his trunk.
  5182	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5183	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“We all seem to be affected in various ways,” he went on, blowing his
  5184	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnose. “Now, you gentlemen were alarmed, I believe, when I trumpeted.”
  5185	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5186	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Not alarmed, exactly,” said the troop-horse, “but it made me feel as
  5187	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthough I had hornets where my saddle ought to be. Don’t begin again.”
  5188	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5189	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I’m frightened of a little dog, and the camel here is frightened by bad
  5190	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdreams in the night.”
  5191	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5192	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“It is very lucky for us that we haven’t all got to fight in the same
  5193	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tway,” said the troop-horse.
  5194	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5195	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“What I want to know,” said the young mule, who had been quiet for a
  5196	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlong time--“what I want to know is, why we have to fight at all.”
  5197	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5198	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Because we’re told to,” said the troop-horse, with a snort of contempt.
  5199	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5200	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Orders,” said Billy the mule, and his teeth snapped.
  5201	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5202	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Hukm hai!” (It is an order!), said the camel with a gurgle, and Two
  5203	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tTails and the bullocks repeated, “Hukm hai!”
  5204	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5205	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Yes, but who gives the orders?” said the recruit-mule.
  5206	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5207	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“The man who walks at your head--Or sits on your back--Or holds the nose
  5208	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\trope--Or twists your tail,” said Billy and the troop-horse and the camel
  5209	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand the bullocks one after the other.
  5210	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5211	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“But who gives them the orders?”
  5212	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5213	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Now you want to know too much, young un,” said Billy, “and that is one
  5214	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tway of getting kicked. All you have to do is to obey the man at your
  5215	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thead and ask no questions.”
  5216	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5217	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“He’s quite right,” said Two Tails. “I can’t always obey, because I’m
  5218	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbetwixt and between. But Billy’s right. Obey the man next to you who
  5219	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgives the order, or you’ll stop all the battery, besides getting a
  5220	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthrashing.”
  5221	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5222	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe gun-bullocks got up to go. “Morning is coming,” they said. “We will
  5223	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgo back to our lines. It is true that we only see out of our eyes, and
  5224	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twe are not very clever. But still, we are the only people to-night who
  5225	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thave not been afraid. Good-night, you brave people.”
  5226	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5227	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tNobody answered, and the troop-horse said, to change the conversation,
  5228	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Where’s that little dog? A dog means a man somewhere about.”
  5229	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5230	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Here I am,” yapped Vixen, “under the gun tail with my man. You big,
  5231	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tblundering beast of a camel you, you upset our tent. My man’s very
  5232	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tangry.”
  5233	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5234	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Phew!” said the bullocks. “He must be white!”
  5235	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5236	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Of course he is,” said Vixen. “Do you suppose I’m looked after by a
  5237	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tblack bullock-driver?”
  5238	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5239	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Huah! Ouach! Ugh!” said the bullocks. “Let us get away quickly.”
  5240	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5241	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThey plunged forward in the mud, and managed somehow to run their yoke
  5242	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ton the pole of an ammunition wagon, where it jammed.
  5243	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5244	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Now you have done it,” said Billy calmly. “Don’t struggle. You’re hung
  5245	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tup till daylight. What on earth’s the matter?”
  5246	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5247	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe bullocks went off into the long hissing snorts that Indian cattle
  5248	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgive, and pushed and crowded and slued and stamped and slipped and
  5249	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tnearly fell down in the mud, grunting savagely.
  5250	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5251	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“You’ll break your necks in a minute,” said the troop-horse. “What’s the
  5252	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmatter with white men? I live with ‘em.”
  5253	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5254	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“They--eat--us! Pull!” said the near bullock. The yoke snapped with a
  5255	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttwang, and they lumbered off together.
  5256	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5257	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tI never knew before what made Indian cattle so scared of Englishmen.
  5258	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tWe eat beef--a thing that no cattle-driver touches--and of course the
  5259	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcattle do not like it.
  5260	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5261	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“May I be flogged with my own pad-chains! Who’d have thought of two big
  5262	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlumps like those losing their heads?” said Billy.
  5263	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5264	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Never mind. I’m going to look at this man. Most of the white men, I
  5265	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tknow, have things in their pockets,” said the troop-horse.
  5266	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5267	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I’ll leave you, then. I can’t say I’m over-fond of ‘em myself. Besides,
  5268	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twhite men who haven’t a place to sleep in are more than likely to be
  5269	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthieves, and I’ve a good deal of Government property on my back. Come
  5270	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\talong, young un, and we’ll go back to our lines. Good-night, Australia!
  5271	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tSee you on parade to-morrow, I suppose. Good-night, old Hay-bale!--try
  5272	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tto control your feelings, won’t you? Good-night, Two Tails! If you pass
  5273	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tus on the ground tomorrow, don’t trumpet. It spoils our formation.”
  5274	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5275	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tBilly the Mule stumped off with the swaggering limp of an old
  5276	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcampaigner, as the troop-horse’s head came nuzzling into my breast, and
  5277	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tI gave him biscuits, while Vixen, who is a most conceited little dog,
  5278	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttold him fibs about the scores of horses that she and I kept.
  5279	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5280	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“I’m coming to the parade to-morrow in my dog-cart,” she said. “Where
  5281	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twill you be?”
  5282	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5283	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“On the left hand of the second squadron. I set the time for all my
  5284	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttroop, little lady,” he said politely. “Now I must go back to Dick. My
  5285	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttail’s all muddy, and he’ll have two hours’ hard work dressing me for
  5286	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tparade.”
  5287	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5288	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe big parade of all the thirty thousand men was held that afternoon,
  5289	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand Vixen and I had a good place close to the Viceroy and the Amir of
  5290	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tAfghanistan, with high, big black hat of astrakhan wool and the great
  5291	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdiamond star in the center. The first part of the review was all
  5292	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsunshine, and the regiments went by in wave upon wave of legs all moving
  5293	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttogether, and guns all in a line, till our eyes grew dizzy. Then the
  5294	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcavalry came up, to the beautiful cavalry canter of “Bonnie Dundee,” and
  5295	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tVixen cocked her ear where she sat on the dog-cart. The second squadron
  5296	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tof the Lancers shot by, and there was the troop-horse, with his tail
  5297	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlike spun silk, his head pulled into his breast, one ear forward and one
  5298	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tback, setting the time for all his squadron, his legs going as smoothly
  5299	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tas waltz music. Then the big guns came by, and I saw Two Tails and two
  5300	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tother elephants harnessed in line to a forty-pounder siege gun, while
  5301	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\ttwenty yoke of oxen walked behind. The seventh pair had a new yoke, and
  5302	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthey looked rather stiff and tired. Last came the screw guns, and Billy
  5303	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthe mule carried himself as though he commanded all the troops, and his
  5304	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tharness was oiled and polished till it winked. I gave a cheer all by
  5305	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmyself for Billy the mule, but he never looked right or left.
  5306	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5307	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThe rain began to fall again, and for a while it was too misty to see
  5308	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twhat the troops were doing. They had made a big half circle across the
  5309	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tplain, and were spreading out into a line. That line grew and grew and
  5310	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tgrew till it was three-quarters of a mile long from wing to wing--one
  5311	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tsolid wall of men, horses, and guns. Then it came on straight toward the
  5312	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tViceroy and the Amir, and as it got nearer the ground began to shake,
  5313	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlike the deck of a steamer when the engines are going fast.
  5314	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5315	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tUnless you have been there you cannot imagine what a frightening effect
  5316	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthis steady come-down of troops has on the spectators, even when they
  5317	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tknow it is only a review. I looked at the Amir. Up till then he had not
  5318	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tshown the shadow of a sign of astonishment or anything else. But now his
  5319	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\teyes began to get bigger and bigger, and he picked up the reins on his
  5320	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\thorse’s neck and looked behind him. For a minute it seemed as though he
  5321	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twere going to draw his sword and slash his way out through the English
  5322	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tmen and women in the carriages at the back. Then the advance stopped
  5323	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tdead, the ground stood still, the whole line saluted, and thirty bands
  5324	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tbegan to play all together. That was the end of the review, and the
  5325	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tregiments went off to their camps in the rain, and an infantry band
  5326	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tstruck up with--
  5327	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5328	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     The animals went in two by two,
  5329	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t          Hurrah!
  5330	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     The animals went in two by two,
  5331	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     The elephant and the battery mul’,
  5332	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     and they all got into the Ark
  5333	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t          For to get out of the rain!
  5334	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5335	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tThen I heard an old grizzled, long-haired Central Asian chief, who had
  5336	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tcome down with the Amir, asking questions of a native officer.
  5337	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5338	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Now,” said he, “in what manner was this wonderful thing done?”
  5339	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5340	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tAnd the officer answered, “An order was given, and they obeyed.”
  5341	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5342	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“But are the beasts as wise as the men?” said the chief.
  5343	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5344	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“They obey, as the men do. Mule, horse, elephant, or bullock, he
  5345	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tobeys his driver, and the driver his sergeant, and the sergeant his
  5346	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tlieutenant, and the lieutenant his captain, and the captain his major,
  5347	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tand the major his colonel, and the colonel his brigadier commanding
  5348	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tthree regiments, and the brigadier the general, who obeys the Viceroy,
  5349	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\twho is the servant of the Empress. Thus it is done.”
  5350	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5351	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“Would it were so in Afghanistan!” said the chief, “for there we obey
  5352	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tonly our own wills.”
  5353	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t
  5354	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“And for that reason,” said the native officer, twirling his mustache,
  5355	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t“your Amir whom you do not obey must come here and take orders from our
  5356	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\tViceroy.”

  5366	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     The wisdom of our foreheads, the cunning of our knees;
  5367	TheJungleBookbyRudyardKipling.txt\t     We bowed our necks to service: they ne’er were loosed again,--
