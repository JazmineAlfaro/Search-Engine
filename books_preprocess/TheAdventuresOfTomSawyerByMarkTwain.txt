   459	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tPREFACE
   460	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   461	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tMost of the adventures recorded in this book really occurred; one or two
   462	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twere experiences of my own, the rest those of boys who were schoolmates
   463	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof mine. Huck Finn is drawn from life; Tom Sawyer also, but not from an
   464	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tindividual--he is a combination of the characteristics of three boys whom
   465	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tI knew, and therefore belongs to the composite order of architecture.
   466	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   467	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe odd superstitions touched upon were all prevalent among children and
   468	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tslaves in the West at the period of this story--that is to say, thirty or
   469	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tforty years ago.
   470	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   471	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAlthough my book is intended mainly for the entertainment of boys and
   472	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgirls, I hope it will not be shunned by men and women on that account,
   473	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfor part of my plan has been to try to pleasantly remind adults of what
   474	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthey once were themselves, and of how they felt and thought and talked,
   475	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand what queer enterprises they sometimes engaged in.

   484	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER I
   485	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   486	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“TOM!”
   487	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   488	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tNo answer.
   489	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   490	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“TOM!”
   491	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   492	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tNo answer.
   493	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   494	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“What’s gone with that boy,  I wonder? You TOM!”
   495	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   496	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tNo answer.
   497	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   498	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the
   499	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\troom; then she put them up and looked out under them. She seldom or
   500	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnever looked _through_ them for so small a thing as a boy; they were
   501	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ther state pair, the pride of her heart, and were built for “style,” not
   502	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tservice--she could have seen through a pair of stove-lids just as well.
   503	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tShe looked perplexed for a moment, and then said, not fiercely, but
   504	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstill loud enough for the furniture to hear:
   505	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   506	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I lay if I get hold of you I’ll--”
   507	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   508	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tShe did not finish, for by this time she was bending down and punching
   509	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tunder the bed with the broom, and so she needed breath to punctuate the
   510	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpunches with. She resurrected nothing but the cat.
   511	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   512	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I never did see the beat of that boy!”
   513	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   514	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tShe went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among the
   515	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttomato vines and “jimpson” weeds that constituted the garden. No Tom. So
   516	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tshe lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for distance and shouted:
   517	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   518	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Y-o-u-u TOM!”
   519	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   520	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThere was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time to seize
   521	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight.
   522	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   523	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“There! I might ‘a’ thought of that closet. What you been doing in
   524	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthere?”
   525	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   526	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Nothing.”
   527	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   528	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Nothing! Look at your hands. And look at your mouth. What _is_ that
   529	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttruck?”
   530	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   531	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I don’t know, aunt.”
   532	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   533	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I know. It’s jam--that’s what it is. Forty times I’ve said if you
   534	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdidn’t let that jam alone I’d skin you. Hand me that switch.”
   535	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   536	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe switch hovered in the air--the peril was desperate--
   537	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   538	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“My! Look behind you, aunt!”
   539	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   540	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe old lady whirled round, and snatched her skirts out of danger.
   541	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe lad fled on the instant, scrambled up the high board-fence, and
   542	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdisappeared over it.
   543	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   544	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHis aunt Polly stood surprised a moment, and then broke into a gentle
   545	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlaugh.
   546	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   547	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hang the boy, can’t I never learn anything? Ain’t he played me tricks
   548	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tenough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time? But old
   549	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfools is the biggest fools there is. Can’t learn an old dog new tricks,
   550	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tas the saying is. But my goodness, he never plays them alike, two days,
   551	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand how is a body to know what’s coming? He ‘pears to know just how long
   552	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\the can torment me before I get my dander up, and he knows if he can make
   553	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tout to put me off for a minute or make me laugh, it’s all down again and
   554	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tI can’t hit him a lick. I ain’t doing my duty by that boy, and that’s
   555	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe Lord’s truth, goodness knows. Spare the rod and spile the child,
   556	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tas the Good Book says. I’m a laying up sin and suffering for us both,
   557	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tI know. He’s full of the Old Scratch, but laws-a-me! he’s my own
   558	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdead sister’s boy, poor thing, and I ain’t got the heart to lash him,
   559	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsomehow. Every time I let him off, my conscience does hurt me so, and
   560	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tevery time I hit him my old heart most breaks. Well-a-well, man that is
   561	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tborn of woman is of few days and full of trouble, as the Scripture
   562	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsays, and I reckon it’s so. He’ll play hookey this evening, * and [*
   563	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tSouthwestern for “afternoon”] I’ll just be obleeged to make him work,
   564	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttomorrow, to punish him. It’s mighty hard to make him work Saturdays,
   565	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhen all the boys is having holiday, but he hates work more than he
   566	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thates anything else, and I’ve _got_ to do some of my duty by him, or
   567	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tI’ll be the ruination of the child.”
   568	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   569	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom did play hookey, and he had a very good time. He got back home
   570	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbarely in season to help Jim, the small colored boy, saw next-day’s wood
   571	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand split the kindlings before supper--at least he was there in time
   572	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto tell his adventures to Jim while Jim did three-fourths of the work.
   573	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom’s younger brother (or rather half-brother) Sid was already through
   574	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twith his part of the work (picking up chips), for he was a quiet boy,
   575	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand had no adventurous, trouble-some ways.
   576	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   577	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tWhile Tom was eating his supper, and stealing sugar as opportunity
   578	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\toffered, Aunt Polly asked him questions that were full of guile, and
   579	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tvery deep--for she wanted to trap him into damaging revealments. Like
   580	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmany other simple-hearted souls, it was her pet vanity to believe she
   581	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas endowed with a talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy, and she
   582	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tloved to contemplate her most transparent devices as marvels of low
   583	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcunning. Said she:
   584	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   585	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tom, it was middling warm in school, warn’t it?”
   586	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   587	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes’m.”
   588	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   589	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Powerful warm, warn’t it?”
   590	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   591	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes’m.”
   592	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   593	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Didn’t you want to go in a-swimming, Tom?”
   594	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   595	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tA bit of a scare shot through Tom--a touch of uncomfortable suspicion. He
   596	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsearched Aunt Polly’s face, but it told him nothing. So he said:
   597	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   598	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No’m--well, not very much.”
   599	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   600	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe old lady reached out her hand and felt Tom’s shirt, and said:
   601	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   602	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“But you ain’t too warm now, though.” And it flattered her to reflect
   603	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat she had discovered that the shirt was dry without anybody knowing
   604	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat that was what she had in her mind. But in spite of her, Tom knew
   605	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhere the wind lay, now. So he forestalled what might be the next move:
   606	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   607	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Some of us pumped on our heads--mine’s damp yet. See?”
   608	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   609	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAunt Polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit of
   610	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcircumstantial evidence, and missed a trick. Then she had a new
   611	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tinspiration:
   612	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   613	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tom, you didn’t have to undo your shirt collar where I sewed it, to
   614	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpump on your head, did you? Unbutton your jacket!”
   615	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   616	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe trouble vanished out of Tom’s face. He opened his jacket. His shirt
   617	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcollar was securely sewed.
   618	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   619	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Bother! Well, go ‘long with you. I’d made sure you’d played hookey
   620	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand been a-swimming. But I forgive ye, Tom. I reckon you’re a kind of a
   621	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsinged cat, as the saying is--better’n you look. _This_ time.”
   622	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   623	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tShe was half sorry her sagacity had miscarried, and half glad that Tom
   624	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thad stumbled into obedient conduct for once.
   625	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   626	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBut Sidney said:
   627	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   628	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, now, if I didn’t think you sewed his collar with white thread,
   629	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbut it’s black.”
   630	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   631	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, I did sew it with white! Tom!”
   632	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   633	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBut Tom did not wait for the rest. As he went out at the door he said:
   634	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   635	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Siddy, I’ll lick you for that.”
   636	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   637	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tIn a safe place Tom examined two large needles which were thrust into
   638	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe lapels of his jacket, and had thread bound about them--one needle
   639	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcarried white thread and the other black. He said:
   640	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   641	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“She’d never noticed if it hadn’t been for Sid. Confound it! sometimes
   642	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tshe sews it with white, and sometimes she sews it with black. I wish to
   643	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgee-miny she’d stick to one or t’other--I can’t keep the run of ‘em. But
   644	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tI bet you I’ll lam Sid for that. I’ll learn him!”
   645	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   646	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHe was not the Model Boy of the village. He knew the model boy very well
   647	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthough--and loathed him.
   648	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   649	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tWithin two minutes, or even less, he had forgotten all his troubles. Not
   650	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbecause his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to him than a
   651	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tman’s are to a man, but because a new and powerful interest bore
   652	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthem down and drove them out of his mind for the time--just as men’s
   653	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmisfortunes are forgotten in the excitement of new enterprises. This new
   654	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tinterest was a valued novelty in whistling, which he had just acquired
   655	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfrom a negro, and he was suffering to practise it un-disturbed. It
   656	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tconsisted in a peculiar bird-like turn, a sort of liquid warble,
   657	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tproduced by touching the tongue to the roof of the mouth at short
   658	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tintervals in the midst of the music--the reader probably remembers how to
   659	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdo it, if he has ever been a boy. Diligence and attention soon gave him
   660	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe knack of it, and he strode down the street with his mouth full of
   661	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tharmony and his soul full of gratitude. He felt much as an astronomer
   662	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfeels who has discovered a new planet--no doubt, as far as strong, deep,
   663	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tunalloyed pleasure is concerned, the advantage was with the boy, not the
   664	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tastronomer.
   665	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   666	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe summer evenings were long. It was not dark, yet. Presently Tom
   667	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tchecked his whistle. A stranger was before him--a boy a shade larger
   668	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthan himself. A new-comer of any age or either sex was an im-pressive
   669	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcuriosity in the poor little shabby village of St. Petersburg. This boy
   670	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas well dressed, too--well dressed on a week-day. This was simply as
   671	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tastounding. His cap was a dainty thing, his close-buttoned blue cloth
   672	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\troundabout was new and natty, and so were his pantaloons. He had shoes
   673	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ton--and it was only Friday. He even wore a necktie, a bright bit of
   674	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tribbon. He had a citified air about him that ate into Tom’s vitals. The
   675	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmore Tom stared at the splendid marvel, the higher he turned up his nose
   676	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tat his finery and the shabbier and shabbier his own outfit seemed to
   677	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thim to grow. Neither boy spoke. If one moved, the other moved--but only
   678	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsidewise, in a circle; they kept face to face and eye to eye all the
   679	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttime. Finally Tom said:
   680	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   681	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I can lick you!”
   682	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   683	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’d like to see you try it.”
   684	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   685	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I can do it.”
   686	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   687	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No you can’t, either.”
   688	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   689	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes I can.”
   690	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   691	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No you can’t.”
   692	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   693	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I can.”
   694	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   695	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“You can’t.”
   696	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   697	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Can!”
   698	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   699	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Can’t!”
   700	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   701	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAn uncomfortable pause. Then Tom said:
   702	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   703	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“What’s your name?”
   704	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   705	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“‘Tisn’t any of your business, maybe.”
   706	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   707	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well I ‘low I’ll _make_ it my business.”
   708	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   709	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well why don’t you?”
   710	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   711	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“If you say much, I will.”
   712	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   713	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Much--much--_much_. There now.”
   714	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   715	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, you think you’re mighty smart, _don’t_ you? I could lick you with
   716	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tone hand tied behind me, if I wanted to.”
   717	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   718	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well why don’t you _do_ it? You _say_ you can do it.”
   719	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   720	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well I _will_, if you fool with me.”
   721	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   722	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh yes--I’ve seen whole families in the same fix.”
   723	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   724	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Smarty! You think you’re _some_, now, _don’t_ you? Oh, what a hat!”
   725	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   726	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“You can lump that hat if you don’t like it. I dare you to knock it
   727	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\toff--and anybody that’ll take a dare will suck eggs.”
   728	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   729	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“You’re a liar!”
   730	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   731	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“You’re another.”
   732	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   733	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“You’re a fighting liar and dasn’t take it up.”
   734	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   735	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Aw--take a walk!”
   736	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   737	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Say--if you give me much more of your sass I’ll take and bounce a rock
   738	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\toff’n your head.”
   739	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   740	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, of _course_ you will.”
   741	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   742	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well I _will_.”
   743	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   744	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well why don’t you _do_ it then? What do you keep _saying_ you will
   745	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfor? Why don’t you _do_ it? It’s because you’re afraid.”
   746	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   747	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I _ain’t_ afraid.”
   748	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   749	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“You are.”
   750	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   751	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I ain’t.”
   752	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   753	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“You are.”
   754	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   755	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAnother pause, and more eying and sidling around each other. Presently
   756	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthey were shoulder to shoulder. Tom said:
   757	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   758	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Get away from here!”
   759	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   760	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Go away yourself!”
   761	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   762	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I won’t.”
   763	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   764	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I won’t either.”
   765	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   766	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tSo they stood, each with a foot placed at an angle as a brace, and both
   767	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tshoving with might and main, and glowering at each other with hate. But
   768	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tneither could get an advantage. After struggling till both were hot and
   769	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tflushed, each relaxed his strain with watchful caution, and Tom said:
   770	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   771	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“You’re a coward and a pup. I’ll tell my big brother on you, and he can
   772	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthrash you with his little finger, and I’ll make him do it, too.”
   773	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   774	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“What do I care for your big brother? I’ve got a brother that’s bigger
   775	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthan he is--and what’s more, he can throw him over that fence, too.”
   776	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t [Both brothers were imaginary.]
   777	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   778	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“That’s a lie.”
   779	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   780	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Your_ saying so don’t make it so.”
   781	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   782	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom drew a line in the dust with his big toe, and said:
   783	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   784	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I dare you to step over that, and I’ll lick you till you can’t stand
   785	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tup. Anybody that’ll take a dare will steal sheep.”
   786	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   787	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe new boy stepped over promptly, and said:
   788	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   789	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now you said you’d do it, now let’s see you do it.”
   790	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   791	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Don’t you crowd me now; you better look out.”
   792	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   793	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, you _said_ you’d do it--why don’t you do it?”
   794	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   795	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“By jingo! for two cents I _will_ do it.”
   796	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   797	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe new boy took two broad coppers out of his pocket and held them out
   798	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twith derision. Tom struck them to the ground. In an instant both boys
   799	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twere rolling and tumbling in the dirt, gripped together like cats; and
   800	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfor the space of a minute they tugged and tore at each other’s hair and
   801	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tclothes, punched and scratched each other’s nose, and covered themselves
   802	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twith dust and glory. Presently the confusion took form, and through the
   803	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfog of battle Tom appeared, seated astride the new boy, and pounding him
   804	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twith his fists. “Holler ‘nuff!” said he.
   805	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   806	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe boy only struggled to free himself. He was crying--mainly from rage.
   807	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   808	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Holler ‘nuff!”--and the pounding went on.
   809	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   810	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAt last the stranger got out a smothered “‘Nuff!” and Tom let him up and
   811	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid:
   812	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   813	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now that’ll learn you. Better look out who you’re fooling with next
   814	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttime.”
   815	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   816	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe new boy went off brushing the dust from his clothes, sobbing,
   817	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsnuffling, and occasionally looking back and shaking his head and
   818	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthreatening what he would do to Tom the “next time he caught him out.”
   819	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t To which Tom responded with jeers, and started off in high feather, and
   820	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tas soon as his back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone, threw it
   821	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand hit him between the shoulders and then turned tail and ran like
   822	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tan antelope. Tom chased the traitor home, and thus found out where he
   823	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlived. He then held a position at the gate for some time, daring the
   824	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tenemy to come outside, but the enemy only made faces at him through the
   825	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twindow and declined. At last the enemy’s mother appeared, and called Tom
   826	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta bad, vicious, vulgar child, and ordered him away. So he went away; but
   827	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\the said he “‘lowed” to “lay” for that boy.
   828	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   829	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHe got home pretty late that night, and when he climbed cautiously in
   830	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tat the window, he uncovered an ambuscade, in the person of his aunt; and
   831	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhen she saw the state his clothes were in her resolution to turn his
   832	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tSaturday holiday into captivity at hard labor became adamantine in its
   833	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfirmness.
   834	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t

   838	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER II
   839	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   840	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tSATURDAY morning was come, and all the summer world was bright and
   841	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfresh, and brimming with life. There was a song in every heart; and if
   842	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe heart was young the music issued at the lips. There was cheer in
   843	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tevery face and a spring in every step. The locust-trees were in bloom
   844	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand the fragrance of the blossoms filled the air. Cardiff Hill, beyond
   845	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe village and above it, was green with vegetation and it lay just far
   846	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tenough away to seem a Delectable Land, dreamy, reposeful, and inviting.
   847	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   848	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a
   849	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlong-handled brush. He surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him and
   850	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit. Thirty yards of board
   851	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfence nine feet high. Life to him seemed hollow, and existence but a
   852	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tburden. Sighing, he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost
   853	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tplank; repeated the operation; did it again; compared the insignificant
   854	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhitewashed streak with the far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed
   855	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfence, and sat down on a tree-box discouraged. Jim came skipping out at
   856	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe gate with a tin pail, and singing Buffalo Gals. Bringing water from
   857	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe town pump had always been hateful work in Tom’s eyes, before, but
   858	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnow it did not strike him so. He remembered that there was company at
   859	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe pump. White, mulatto, and negro boys and girls were always there
   860	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twaiting their turns, resting, trading playthings, quarrelling, fighting,
   861	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tskylarking. And he remembered that although the pump was only a hundred
   862	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand fifty yards off, Jim never got back with a bucket of water under an
   863	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thour--and even then somebody generally had to go after him. Tom said:
   864	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   865	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Say, Jim, I’ll fetch the water if you’ll whitewash some.”
   866	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   867	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tJim shook his head and said:
   868	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   869	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Can’t, Mars Tom. Ole missis, she tole me I got to go an’ git dis water
   870	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tan’ not stop foolin’ roun’ wid anybody. She say she spec’ Mars Tom gwine
   871	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto ax me to whitewash, an’ so she tole me go ‘long an’ ‘tend to my own
   872	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbusiness--she ‘lowed _she’d_ ‘tend to de whitewashin’.”
   873	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   874	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, never you mind what she said, Jim. That’s the way she always talks.
   875	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tGimme the bucket--I won’t be gone only a a minute. _She_ won’t ever
   876	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tknow.”
   877	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   878	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, I dasn’t, Mars Tom. Ole missis she’d take an’ tar de head off’n me.
   879	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t‘Deed she would.”
   880	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   881	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“_She_! She never licks anybody--whacks ‘em over the head with her
   882	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthimble--and who cares for that, I’d like to know. She talks awful, but
   883	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttalk don’t hurt--anyways it don’t if she don’t cry. Jim, I’ll give you a
   884	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmarvel. I’ll give you a white alley!”
   885	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   886	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tJim began to waver.
   887	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   888	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“White alley, Jim! And it’s a bully taw.”
   889	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   890	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“My! Dat’s a mighty gay marvel, I tell you! But Mars Tom I’s powerful
   891	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t‘fraid ole missis--”
   892	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   893	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“And besides, if you will I’ll show you my sore toe.”
   894	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   895	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tJim was only human--this attraction was too much for him. He put down
   896	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\this pail, took the white alley, and bent over the toe with absorbing
   897	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tinterest while the bandage was being unwound. In another moment he
   898	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas flying down the street with his pail and a tingling rear, Tom was
   899	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhitewashing with vigor, and Aunt Polly was retiring from the field with
   900	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta slipper in her hand and triumph in her eye.
   901	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   902	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBut Tom’s energy did not last. He began to think of the fun he had
   903	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tplanned for this day, and his sorrows multiplied. Soon the free boys
   904	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twould come tripping along on all sorts of delicious expeditions, and
   905	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthey would make a world of fun of him for having to work--the very
   906	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthought of it burnt him like fire. He got out his worldly wealth and
   907	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\texamined it--bits of toys, marbles, and trash; enough to buy an exchange
   908	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof _work_, maybe, but not half enough to buy so much as half an hour
   909	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof pure freedom. So he returned his straitened means to his pocket, and
   910	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgave up the idea of trying to buy the boys. At this dark and hopeless
   911	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmoment an inspiration burst upon him! Nothing less than a great,
   912	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmagnificent inspiration.
   913	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   914	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHe took up his brush and went tranquilly to work. Ben Rogers hove in
   915	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsight presently--the very boy, of all boys, whose ridicule he had been
   916	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdreading. Ben’s gait was the hop-skip-and-jump--proof enough that his
   917	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\theart was light and his anticipations high. He was eating an apple, and
   918	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgiving a long, melodious whoop, at intervals, followed by a deep-toned
   919	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tding-dong-dong, ding-dong-dong, for he was personating a steamboat. As
   920	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\the drew near, he slackened speed, took the middle of the street, leaned
   921	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfar over to starboard and rounded to ponderously and with laborious pomp
   922	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand circumstance--for he was personating the Big Missouri, and considered
   923	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thimself to be drawing nine feet of water. He was boat and captain and
   924	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tengine-bells combined, so he had to imagine himself standing on his own
   925	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thurricane-deck giving the orders and executing them:
   926	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   927	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Stop her, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling!” The headway ran almost out, and he
   928	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdrew up slowly toward the sidewalk.
   929	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   930	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Ship up to back! Ting-a-ling-ling!” His arms straightened and stiffened
   931	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdown his sides.
   932	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   933	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Set her back on the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow! ch-chow-wow!
   934	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tChow!” His right hand, mean-time, describing stately circles--for it was
   935	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\trepresenting a forty-foot wheel.
   936	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   937	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Let her go back on the labboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Chow-ch-chow-chow!”
   938	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t The left hand began to describe circles.
   939	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   940	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Stop the stabboard! Ting-a-ling-ling! Stop the labboard! Come ahead on
   941	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe stabboard! Stop her! Let your outside turn over slow! Ting-a-ling-ling!
   942	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tChow-ow-ow! Get out that head-line! _lively_ now! Come--out with
   943	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tyour spring-line--what’re you about there! Take a turn round that stump
   944	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twith the bight of it! Stand by that stage, now--let her go! Done with
   945	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe engines, sir! Ting-a-ling-ling! SH’T! S’H’T! SH’T!” (trying the
   946	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgauge-cocks).
   947	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   948	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom went on whitewashing--paid no attention to the steamboat. Ben stared
   949	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta moment and then said: “_Hi-Yi! You’re_ up a stump, ain’t you!”
   950	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   951	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tNo answer. Tom surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist, then
   952	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\the gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result, as
   953	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore. Ben ranged up alongside of him. Tom’s mouth watered for the
   954	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tapple, but he stuck to his work. Ben said:
   955	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   956	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hello, old chap, you got to work, hey?”
   957	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   958	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom wheeled suddenly and said:
   959	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   960	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, it’s you, Ben! I warn’t noticing.”
   961	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   962	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Say--I’m going in a-swimming, I am. Don’t you wish you could? But of
   963	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcourse you’d druther _work_--wouldn’t you? Course you would!”
   964	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   965	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom contemplated the boy a bit, and said:
   966	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   967	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“What do you call work?”
   968	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   969	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, ain’t _that_ work?”
   970	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   971	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom resumed his whitewashing, and answered carelessly:
   972	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   973	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, maybe it is, and maybe it ain’t. All I know, is, it suits Tom
   974	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tSawyer.”
   975	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   976	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh come, now, you don’t mean to let on that you _like_ it?”
   977	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   978	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe brush continued to move.
   979	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   980	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Like it? Well, I don’t see why I oughtn’t to like it. Does a boy get a
   981	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tchance to whitewash a fence every day?”
   982	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   983	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThat put the thing in a new light. Ben stopped nibbling his apple.
   984	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom swept his brush daintily back and forth--stepped back to note the
   985	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\teffect--added a touch here and there--criticised the effect again--Ben
   986	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twatching every move and getting more and more interested, more and more
   987	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tabsorbed. Presently he said:
   988	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   989	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Say, Tom, let _me_ whitewash a little.”
   990	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   991	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom considered, was about to consent; but he altered his mind:
   992	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
   993	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No--no--I reckon it wouldn’t hardly do, Ben. You see, Aunt Polly’s awful
   994	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tparticular about this fence--right here on the street, you know--but if it
   995	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas the back fence I wouldn’t mind and _she_ wouldn’t. Yes, she’s awful
   996	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tparticular about this fence; it’s got to be done very careful; I reckon
   997	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthere ain’t one boy in a thousand, maybe two thousand, that can do it
   998	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe way it’s got to be done.”
   999	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1000	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No--is that so? Oh come, now--lemme just try. Only just a little--I’d let
  1001	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t_you_, if you was me, Tom.”
  1002	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1003	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Ben, I’d like to, honest injun; but Aunt Polly--well, Jim wanted to do
  1004	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tit, but she wouldn’t let him; Sid wanted to do it, and she wouldn’t let
  1005	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tSid. Now don’t you see how I’m fixed? If you was to tackle this fence
  1006	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand anything was to happen to it--”
  1007	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1008	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, shucks, I’ll be just as careful. Now lemme try. Say--I’ll give you
  1009	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe core of my apple.”
  1010	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1011	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, here--No, Ben, now don’t. I’m afeard--”
  1012	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1013	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’ll give you _all_ of it!”
  1014	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1015	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face, but alacrity in his
  1016	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\theart. And while the late steamer Big Missouri worked and sweated in the
  1017	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsun, the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade close by,
  1018	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdangled his legs, munched his apple, and planned the slaughter of more
  1019	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tinnocents. There was no lack of material; boys happened along every
  1020	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlittle while; they came to jeer, but remained to whitewash. By the time
  1021	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBen was fagged out, Tom had traded the next chance to Billy Fisher for
  1022	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta kite, in good repair; and when he played out, Johnny Miller bought in
  1023	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfor a dead rat and a string to swing it with--and so on, and so on, hour
  1024	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tafter hour. And when the middle of the afternoon came, from being a
  1025	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpoor poverty-stricken boy in the morning, Tom was literally rolling in
  1026	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twealth. He had besides the things before mentioned, twelve marbles, part
  1027	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof a jews-harp, a piece of blue bottle-glass to look through, a spool
  1028	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcannon, a key that wouldn’t unlock anything, a fragment of chalk, a
  1029	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tglass stopper of a decanter, a tin soldier, a couple of tadpoles,
  1030	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsix fire-crackers, a kitten with only one eye, a brass door-knob, a
  1031	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdog-collar--but no dog--the handle of a knife, four pieces of orange-peel,
  1032	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand a dilapidated old window sash.
  1033	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1034	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHe had had a nice, good, idle time all the while--plenty of company--and
  1035	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe fence had three coats of whitewash on it! If he hadn’t run out of
  1036	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhitewash he would have bankrupted every boy in the village.
  1037	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1038	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world, after all. He
  1039	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thad discovered a great law of human action, without knowing it--namely,
  1040	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing, it is only necessary
  1041	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto make the thing difficult to attain. If he had been a great and
  1042	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twise philosopher, like the writer of this book, he would now have
  1043	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcomprehended that Work consists of whatever a body is _obliged_ to do,
  1044	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand that Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do. And
  1045	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthis would help him to understand why constructing artificial flowers or
  1046	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tperforming on a tread-mill is work, while rolling ten-pins or climbing

  1061	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1062	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTOM presented himself before Aunt Polly, who was sitting by an
  1063	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\topen window in a pleasant rearward apartment, which was bedroom,
  1064	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbreakfast-room, dining-room, and library, combined. The balmy summer
  1065	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tair, the restful quiet, the odor of the flowers, and the drowsing
  1066	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmurmur of the bees had had their effect, and she was nodding over her
  1067	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tknitting--for she had no company but the cat, and it was asleep in her
  1068	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlap. Her spectacles were propped up on her gray head for safety. She had
  1069	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthought that of course Tom had deserted long ago, and she wondered at
  1070	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tseeing him place himself in her power again in this intrepid way. He
  1071	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid: “Mayn’t I go and play now, aunt?”
  1072	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1073	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“What, a’ready? How much have you done?”
  1074	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1075	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s all done, aunt.”
  1076	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1077	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tom, don’t lie to me--I can’t bear it.”
  1078	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1079	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I ain’t, aunt; it _is_ all done.”
  1080	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1081	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAunt Polly placed small trust in such evidence. She went out to see for
  1082	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\therself; and she would have been content to find twenty per cent. of
  1083	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom’s statement true. When she found the entire fence white-washed, and
  1084	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnot only whitewashed but elaborately coated and recoated, and even a
  1085	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstreak added to the ground, her astonishment was almost unspeakable. She
  1086	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid:
  1087	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1088	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I never! There’s no getting round it, you can work when you’re a
  1089	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmind to, Tom.” And then she diluted the compliment by adding, “But it’s
  1090	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpowerful seldom you’re a mind to, I’m bound to say. Well, go ‘long and
  1091	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tplay; but mind you get back some time in a week, or I’ll tan you.”
  1092	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1093	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tShe was so overcome by the splendor of his achievement that she took
  1094	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thim into the closet and selected a choice apple and delivered it to him,
  1095	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\talong with an improving lecture upon the added value and flavor a treat
  1096	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttook to itself when it came without sin through virtuous effort.
  1097	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd while she closed with a happy Scriptural flourish, he “hooked” a
  1098	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdoughnut.
  1099	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1100	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThen he skipped out, and saw Sid just starting up the outside stairway
  1101	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat led to the back rooms on the second floor. Clods were handy and
  1102	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe air was full of them in a twinkling. They raged around Sid like a
  1103	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thail-storm; and before Aunt Polly could collect her surprised faculties
  1104	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand sally to the rescue, six or seven clods had taken personal effect,
  1105	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand Tom was over the fence and gone. There was a gate, but as a general
  1106	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthing he was too crowded for time to make use of it. His soul was at
  1107	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpeace, now that he had settled with Sid for calling attention to his
  1108	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tblack thread and getting him into trouble.
  1109	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1110	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom skirted the block, and came round into a muddy alley that led by the
  1111	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tback of his aunt’s cow-stable. He presently got safely beyond the reach
  1112	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof capture and punishment, and hastened toward the public square of the
  1113	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tvillage, where two “military” companies of boys had met for conflict,
  1114	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\taccording to previous appointment. Tom was General of one of these
  1115	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tarmies, Joe Harper (a bosom friend) General of the other. These two
  1116	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgreat commanders did not condescend to fight in person--that being better
  1117	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsuited to the still smaller fry--but sat together on an eminence
  1118	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand conducted the field operations by orders delivered through
  1119	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\taides-de-camp. Tom’s army won a great victory, after a long and
  1120	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thard-fought battle. Then the dead were counted, prisoners exchanged,
  1121	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe terms of the next disagreement agreed upon, and the day for the
  1122	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnecessary battle appointed; after which the armies fell into line and
  1123	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmarched away, and Tom turned homeward alone.
  1124	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1125	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAs he was passing by the house where Jeff Thatcher lived, he saw a new
  1126	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgirl in the garden--a lovely little blue-eyed creature with yellow
  1127	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thair plaited into two long-tails, white summer frock and embroidered
  1128	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpan-talettes. The fresh-crowned hero fell without firing a shot. A
  1129	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcertain Amy Lawrence vanished out of his heart and left not even a
  1130	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmemory of herself behind. He had thought he loved her to distraction;
  1131	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\the had regarded his passion as adoration; and behold it was only a poor
  1132	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlittle evanescent partiality. He had been months winning her; she had
  1133	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tconfessed hardly a week ago; he had been the happiest and the proudest
  1134	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tboy in the world only seven short days, and here in one instant of time
  1135	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tshe had gone out of his heart like a casual stranger whose visit is
  1136	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdone.
  1137	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1138	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHe worshipped this new angel with furtive eye, till he saw that she had
  1139	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdiscovered him; then he pretended he did not know she was present, and
  1140	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbegan to “show off” in all sorts of absurd boyish ways, in order to win
  1141	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ther admiration. He kept up this grotesque foolishness for some time;
  1142	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbut by-and-by, while he was in the midst of some dangerous gymnastic
  1143	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tperformances, he glanced aside and saw that the little girl was wending
  1144	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ther way toward the house. Tom came up to the fence and leaned on it,
  1145	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgrieving, and hoping she would tarry yet awhile longer. She halted a
  1146	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmoment on the steps and then moved toward the door. Tom heaved a great
  1147	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsigh as she put her foot on the threshold. But his face lit up,
  1148	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tright away, for she tossed a pansy over the fence a moment before she
  1149	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdisappeared.
  1150	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1151	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe boy ran around and stopped within a foot or two of the flower, and
  1152	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthen shaded his eyes with his hand and began to look down street as
  1153	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tif he had discovered something of interest going on in that direction.
  1154	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tPresently he picked up a straw and began trying to balance it on his
  1155	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnose, with his head tilted far back; and as he moved from side to side,
  1156	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin his efforts, he edged nearer and nearer toward the pansy; finally his
  1157	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbare foot rested upon it, his pliant toes closed upon it, and he hopped
  1158	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\taway with the treasure and disappeared round the corner. But only for a
  1159	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tminute--only while he could button the flower inside his jacket, next
  1160	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\this heart--or next his stomach, possibly, for he was not much posted in
  1161	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tanatomy, and not hypercritical, anyway.
  1162	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1163	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHe returned, now, and hung about the fence till nightfall, “showing
  1164	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\toff,” as before; but the girl never exhibited herself again, though Tom
  1165	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcomforted himself a little with the hope that she had been near some
  1166	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twindow, meantime, and been aware of his attentions. Finally he strode
  1167	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thome reluctantly, with his poor head full of visions.
  1168	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1169	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAll through supper his spirits were so high that his aunt wondered “what
  1170	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thad got into the child.” He took a good scolding about clodding Sid, and
  1171	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdid not seem to mind it in the least. He tried to steal sugar under his
  1172	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\taunt’s very nose, and got his knuckles rapped for it. He said:
  1173	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1174	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Aunt, you don’t whack Sid when he takes it.”
  1175	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1176	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, Sid don’t torment a body the way you do. You’d be always into
  1177	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat sugar if I warn’t watching you.”
  1178	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1179	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tPresently she stepped into the kitchen, and Sid, happy in his immunity,
  1180	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\treached for the sugar-bowl--a sort of glorying over Tom which was
  1181	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twellnigh unbearable. But Sid’s fingers slipped and the bowl dropped and
  1182	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbroke. Tom was in ecstasies. In such ecstasies that he even controlled
  1183	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\this tongue and was silent. He said to himself that he would not speak a
  1184	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tword, even when his aunt came in, but would sit perfectly still till she
  1185	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tasked who did the mischief; and then he would tell, and there would be
  1186	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnothing so good in the world as to see that pet model “catch it.” He was
  1187	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tso brimful of exultation that he could hardly hold himself when the old
  1188	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlady came back and stood above the wreck discharging lightnings of wrath
  1189	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfrom over her spectacles. He said to himself, “Now it’s coming!” And the
  1190	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnext instant he was sprawling on the floor! The potent palm was uplifted
  1191	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto strike again when Tom cried out:
  1192	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1193	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hold on, now, what ‘er you belting _me_ for?--Sid broke it!”
  1194	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1195	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAunt Polly paused, perplexed, and Tom looked for healing pity. But when
  1196	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tshe got her tongue again, she only said:
  1197	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1198	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Umf! Well, you didn’t get a lick amiss, I reckon. You been into some
  1199	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tother audacious mischief when I wasn’t around, like enough.”
  1200	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1201	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThen her conscience reproached her, and she yearned to say something
  1202	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tkind and loving; but she judged that this would be construed into a
  1203	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tconfession that she had been in the wrong, and discipline forbade that.
  1204	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tSo she kept silence, and went about her affairs with a troubled heart.
  1205	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom sulked in a corner and exalted his woes. He knew that in her heart
  1206	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\this aunt was on her knees to him, and he was morosely gratified by the
  1207	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tconsciousness of it. He would hang out no signals, he would take notice
  1208	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof none. He knew that a yearning glance fell upon him, now and then,
  1209	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthrough a film of tears, but he refused recognition of it. He pictured
  1210	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thimself lying sick unto death and his aunt bending over him beseeching
  1211	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tone little forgiving word, but he would turn his face to the wall, and
  1212	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdie with that word unsaid. Ah, how would she feel then? And he pictured
  1213	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thimself brought home from the river, dead, with his curls all wet, and
  1214	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\this sore heart at rest. How she would throw herself upon him, and how
  1215	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ther tears would fall like rain, and her lips pray God to give her back
  1216	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ther boy and she would never, never abuse him any more! But he would
  1217	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlie there cold and white and make no sign--a poor little sufferer, whose
  1218	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgriefs were at an end. He so worked upon his feelings with the pathos of
  1219	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthese dreams, that he had to keep swallowing, he was so like to choke;
  1220	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand his eyes swam in a blur of water, which overflowed when he winked,
  1221	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand ran down and trickled from the end of his nose. And such a luxury to
  1222	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thim was this petting of his sorrows, that he could not bear to have any
  1223	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tworldly cheeriness or any grating delight intrude upon it; it was too
  1224	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsacred for such contact; and so, presently, when his cousin Mary danced
  1225	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin, all alive with the joy of seeing home again after an age-long visit
  1226	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof one week to the country, he got up and moved in clouds and darkness
  1227	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tout at one door as she brought song and sunshine in at the other.
  1228	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1229	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHe wandered far from the accustomed haunts of boys, and sought desolate
  1230	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tplaces that were in harmony with his spirit. A log raft in the river
  1231	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tinvited him, and he seated himself on its outer edge and contemplated
  1232	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe dreary vastness of the stream, wishing, the while, that he could
  1233	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tonly be drowned, all at once and unconsciously, without undergoing the
  1234	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tuncomfortable routine devised by nature. Then he thought of his flower.
  1235	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHe got it out, rumpled and wilted, and it mightily increased his dismal
  1236	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfelicity. He wondered if she would pity him if she knew? Would she
  1237	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcry, and wish that she had a right to put her arms around his neck and
  1238	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcomfort him? Or would she turn coldly away like all the hollow world?
  1239	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThis picture brought such an agony of pleasurable suffering that he
  1240	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tworked it over and over again in his mind and set it up in new and
  1241	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tvaried lights, till he wore it threadbare. At last he rose up sighing
  1242	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand departed in the darkness.
  1243	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1244	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAbout half-past nine or ten o’clock he came along the deserted street to
  1245	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhere the Adored Unknown lived; he paused a moment; no sound fell upon
  1246	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\this listening ear; a candle was casting a dull glow upon the curtain
  1247	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof a second-story window. Was the sacred presence there? He climbed the
  1248	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfence, threaded his stealthy way through the plants, till he stood under
  1249	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat window; he looked up at it long, and with emotion; then he laid him
  1250	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdown on the ground under it, disposing himself upon his back, with his
  1251	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thands clasped upon his breast and holding his poor wilted flower.
  1252	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd thus he would die--out in the cold world, with no shelter over his
  1253	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thomeless head, no friendly hand to wipe the death-damps from his brow,
  1254	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tno loving face to bend pityingly over him when the great agony came. And
  1255	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthus _she_ would see him when she looked out upon the glad morning, and
  1256	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\toh! would she drop one little tear upon his poor, lifeless form, would
  1257	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tshe heave one little sigh to see a bright young life so rudely blighted,
  1258	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tso untimely cut down?
  1259	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1260	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe window went up, a maid-servant’s discordant voice profaned the holy
  1261	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcalm, and a deluge of water drenched the prone martyr’s remains!
  1262	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1263	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe strangling hero sprang up with a relieving snort. There was a whiz
  1264	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tas of a missile in the air, mingled with the murmur of a curse, a sound
  1265	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tas of shivering glass followed, and a small, vague form went over the
  1266	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfence and shot away in the gloom.
  1267	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1268	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tNot long after, as Tom, all undressed for bed, was surveying his
  1269	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdrenched garments by the light of a tallow dip, Sid woke up; but if he
  1270	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thad any dim idea of making any “references to allusions,” he thought
  1271	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbetter of it and held his peace, for there was danger in Tom’s eye.
  1272	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1273	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom turned in without the added vexation of prayers, and Sid made mental
  1274	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnote of the omission.
  1275	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1276	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t

  1278	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1279	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER IV
  1280	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1281	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTHE sun rose upon a tranquil world, and beamed down upon the peaceful
  1282	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tvillage like a benediction. Breakfast over, Aunt Polly had family
  1283	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tworship: it began with a prayer built from the ground up of solid
  1284	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcourses of Scriptural quotations, welded together with a thin mortar of
  1285	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\toriginality; and from the summit of this she delivered a grim chapter of
  1286	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe Mosaic Law, as from Sinai.
  1287	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1288	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThen Tom girded up his loins, so to speak, and went to work to “get
  1289	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\this verses.” Sid had learned his lesson days before. Tom bent all his
  1290	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tenergies to the memorizing of five verses, and he chose part of the
  1291	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tSermon on the Mount, because he could find no verses that were shorter.
  1292	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAt the end of half an hour Tom had a vague general idea of his lesson,
  1293	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbut no more, for his mind was traversing the whole field of human
  1294	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthought, and his hands were busy with distracting recreations. Mary took
  1295	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\this book to hear him recite, and he tried to find his way through the
  1296	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfog:
  1297	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1298	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Blessed are the--a--a--”
  1299	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1300	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Poor”--
  1301	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1302	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes--poor; blessed are the poor--a--a--”
  1303	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1304	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“In spirit--”
  1305	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1306	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“In spirit; blessed are the poor in spirit, for they--they--”
  1307	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1308	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Theirs_--”
  1309	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1310	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“For _theirs_. Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom
  1311	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof heaven. Blessed are they that mourn, for they--they--”
  1312	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1313	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Sh--”
  1314	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1315	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“For they--a--”
  1316	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1317	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“S, H, A--”
  1318	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1319	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“For they S, H--Oh, I don’t know what it is!”
  1320	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1321	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Shall_!”
  1322	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1323	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, _shall_! for they shall--for they shall--a--a--shall mourn--a--a--blessed
  1324	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tare they that shall--they that--a--they that shall mourn, for they
  1325	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tshall--a--shall _what_? Why don’t you tell me, Mary?--what do you want to
  1326	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbe so mean for?”
  1327	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1328	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, Tom, you poor thick-headed thing, I’m not teasing you. I wouldn’t
  1329	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdo that. You must go and learn it again. Don’t you be discouraged, Tom,
  1330	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tyou’ll manage it--and if you do, I’ll give you something ever so nice.
  1331	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThere, now, that’s a good boy.”
  1332	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1333	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right! What is it, Mary, tell me what it is.”
  1334	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1335	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Never you mind, Tom. You know if I say it’s nice, it is nice.”
  1336	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1337	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“You bet you that’s so, Mary. All right, I’ll tackle it again.”
  1338	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1339	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd he did “tackle it again”--and under the double pressure of curiosity
  1340	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand prospective gain he did it with such spirit that he accomplished a
  1341	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tshining success. Mary gave him a brand-new “Barlow” knife worth twelve
  1342	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand a half cents; and the convulsion of delight that swept his system
  1343	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tshook him to his foundations. True, the knife would not cut anything,
  1344	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbut it was a “sure-enough” Barlow, and there was inconceivable grandeur
  1345	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin that--though where the Western boys ever got the idea that such a
  1346	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tweapon could possibly be counterfeited to its injury is an imposing
  1347	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmystery and will always remain so, perhaps. Tom contrived to scarify the
  1348	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcupboard with it, and was arranging to begin on the bureau, when he was
  1349	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcalled off to dress for Sunday-school.
  1350	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1351	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tMary gave him a tin basin of water and a piece of soap, and he went
  1352	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\toutside the door and set the basin on a little bench there; then he
  1353	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdipped the soap in the water and laid it down; turned up his sleeves;
  1354	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpoured out the water on the ground, gently, and then entered the kitchen
  1355	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand began to wipe his face diligently on the towel behind the door. But
  1356	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tMary removed the towel and said:
  1357	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1358	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now ain’t you ashamed, Tom. You mustn’t be so bad. Water won’t hurt
  1359	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tyou.”
  1360	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1361	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom was a trifle disconcerted. The basin was refilled, and this time he
  1362	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstood over it a little while, gathering resolution; took in a big breath
  1363	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand began. When he entered the kitchen presently, with both eyes shut
  1364	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand groping for the towel with his hands, an honorable testimony of
  1365	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsuds and water was dripping from his face. But when he emerged from
  1366	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe towel, he was not yet satisfactory, for the clean territory stopped
  1367	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tshort at his chin and his jaws, like a mask; below and beyond this line
  1368	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthere was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread downward in
  1369	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfront and backward around his neck. Mary took him in hand, and when she
  1370	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas done with him he was a man and a brother, without distinction of
  1371	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcolor, and his saturated hair was neatly brushed, and its short curls
  1372	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twrought into a dainty and symmetrical general effect. [He privately
  1373	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsmoothed out the curls, with labor and difficulty, and plastered his
  1374	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thair close down to his head; for he held curls to be effeminate, and his
  1375	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\town filled his life with bitterness.] Then Mary got out a suit of his
  1376	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tclothing that had been used only on Sundays during two years--they were
  1377	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsimply called his “other clothes”--and so by that we know the size of his
  1378	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twardrobe. The girl “put him to rights” after he had dressed himself;
  1379	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tshe buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin, turned his vast shirt
  1380	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcollar down over his shoulders, brushed him off and crowned him with
  1381	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\this speckled straw hat. He now looked exceedingly improved and
  1382	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tuncomfortable. He was fully as uncomfortable as he looked; for there
  1383	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas a restraint about whole clothes and cleanliness that galled him. He
  1384	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thoped that Mary would forget his shoes, but the hope was blighted; she
  1385	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcoated them thoroughly with tallow, as was the custom, and brought
  1386	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthem out. He lost his temper and said he was always being made to do
  1387	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\teverything he didn’t want to do. But Mary said, persuasively:
  1388	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1389	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Please, Tom--that’s a good boy.”
  1390	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1391	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tSo he got into the shoes snarling. Mary was soon ready, and the three
  1392	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tchildren set out for Sunday-school--a place that Tom hated with his whole
  1393	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\theart; but Sid and Mary were fond of it.
  1394	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1395	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tSabbath-school hours were from nine to half-past ten; and then church
  1396	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tservice. Two of the children always remained for the sermon voluntarily,
  1397	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand the other always remained too--for stronger reasons. The church’s
  1398	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thigh-backed, uncushioned pews would seat about three hundred persons;
  1399	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe edifice was but a small, plain affair, with a sort of pine board
  1400	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttree-box on top of it for a steeple. At the door Tom dropped back a step
  1401	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand accosted a Sunday-dressed comrade:
  1402	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1403	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Say, Billy, got a yaller ticket?”
  1404	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1405	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes.”
  1406	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1407	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“What’ll you take for her?”
  1408	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1409	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“What’ll you give?”
  1410	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1411	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Piece of lickrish and a fish-hook.”
  1412	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1413	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Less see ‘em.”
  1414	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1415	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom exhibited. They were satisfactory, and the property changed hands.
  1416	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThen Tom traded a couple of white alleys for three red tickets, and some
  1417	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsmall trifle or other for a couple of blue ones. He waylaid other
  1418	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tboys as they came, and went on buying tickets of various colors ten
  1419	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tor fifteen minutes longer. He entered the church, now, with a swarm
  1420	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof clean and noisy boys and girls, proceeded to his seat and started
  1421	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta quarrel with the first boy that came handy. The teacher, a grave,
  1422	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\telderly man, interfered; then turned his back a moment and Tom pulled a
  1423	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tboy’s hair in the next bench, and was absorbed in his book when the boy
  1424	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tturned around; stuck a pin in another boy, presently, in order to hear
  1425	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thim say “Ouch!” and got a new reprimand from his teacher. Tom’s whole
  1426	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tclass were of a pattern--restless, noisy, and troublesome. When they came
  1427	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto recite their lessons, not one of them knew his verses perfectly, but
  1428	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thad to be prompted all along. However, they worried through, and each
  1429	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgot his reward--in small blue tickets, each with a passage of Scripture
  1430	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ton it; each blue ticket was pay for two verses of the recitation. Ten
  1431	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tblue tickets equalled a red one, and could be exchanged for it; ten red
  1432	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttickets equalled a yellow one; for ten yellow tickets the superintendent
  1433	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgave a very plainly bound Bible (worth forty cents in those easy
  1434	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttimes) to the pupil. How many of my readers would have the industry and
  1435	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tapplication to memorize two thousand verses, even for a Dore Bible? And
  1436	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tyet Mary had acquired two Bibles in this way--it was the patient work of
  1437	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttwo years--and a boy of German parentage had won four or five. He once
  1438	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\trecited three thousand verses without stopping; but the strain upon his
  1439	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmental faculties was too great, and he was little better than an idiot
  1440	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfrom that day forth--a grievous misfortune for the school, for on great
  1441	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\toccasions, before company, the superintendent (as Tom expressed it)
  1442	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thad always made this boy come out and “spread himself.” Only the older
  1443	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpupils managed to keep their tickets and stick to their tedious work
  1444	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlong enough to get a Bible, and so the delivery of one of these prizes
  1445	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas a rare and noteworthy circumstance; the successful pupil was so
  1446	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgreat and conspicuous for that day that on the spot every scholar’s
  1447	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\theart was fired with a fresh ambition that often lasted a couple
  1448	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof weeks. It is possible that Tom’s mental stomach had never really
  1449	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thungered for one of those prizes, but unquestionably his entire being
  1450	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thad for many a day longed for the glory and the eclat that came with it.
  1451	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1452	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tIn due course the superintendent stood up in front of the pulpit, with
  1453	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta closed hymn-book in his hand and his forefinger inserted between its
  1454	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tleaves, and commanded attention. When a Sunday-school superintendent
  1455	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmakes his customary little speech, a hymn-book in the hand is as
  1456	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnecessary as is the inevitable sheet of music in the hand of a singer
  1457	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twho stands forward on the platform and sings a solo at a concert--though
  1458	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhy, is a mystery: for neither the hymn-book nor the sheet of music
  1459	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tis ever referred to by the sufferer. This superintendent was a slim
  1460	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcreature of thirty-five, with a sandy goatee and short sandy hair; he
  1461	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twore a stiff standing-collar whose upper edge almost reached his ears
  1462	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand whose sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of his mouth--a
  1463	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfence that compelled a straight lookout ahead, and a turning of the
  1464	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhole body when a side view was required; his chin was propped on a
  1465	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tspreading cravat which was as broad and as long as a bank-note, and had
  1466	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfringed ends; his boot toes were turned sharply up, in the fashion
  1467	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof the day, like sleigh-runners--an effect patiently and laboriously
  1468	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tproduced by the young men by sitting with their toes pressed against a
  1469	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twall for hours together. Mr. Walters was very earnest of mien, and very
  1470	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsincere and honest at heart; and he held sacred things and places
  1471	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin such reverence, and so separated them from worldly matters, that
  1472	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tunconsciously to himself his Sunday-school voice had acquired a peculiar
  1473	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tintonation which was wholly absent on week-days. He began after this
  1474	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfashion:
  1475	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1476	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now, children, I want you all to sit up just as straight and pretty as
  1477	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tyou can and give me all your attention for a minute or two. There--that
  1478	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tis it. That is the way good little boys and girls should do. I see one
  1479	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlittle girl who is looking out of the window--I am afraid she thinks I
  1480	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tam out there somewhere--perhaps up in one of the trees making a speech
  1481	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto the little birds. [Applausive titter.] I want to tell you how good it
  1482	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmakes me feel to see so many bright, clean little faces assembled in a
  1483	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tplace like this, learning to do right and be good.” And so forth and so
  1484	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ton. It is not necessary to set down the rest of the oration. It was of a
  1485	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpattern which does not vary, and so it is familiar to us all.
  1486	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1487	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of fights
  1488	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand other recreations among certain of the bad boys, and by fidgetings
  1489	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand whisperings that extended far and wide, washing even to the bases of
  1490	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tisolated and incorruptible rocks like Sid and Mary. But now every sound
  1491	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tceased suddenly, with the subsidence of Mr. Walters’ voice, and the
  1492	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tconclusion of the speech was received with a burst of silent gratitude.
  1493	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1494	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tA good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event which was
  1495	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmore or less rare--the entrance of visitors: lawyer Thatcher, accompanied
  1496	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tby a very feeble and aged man; a fine, portly, middle-aged gentleman
  1497	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twith iron-gray hair; and a dignified lady who was doubtless the latter’s
  1498	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twife. The lady was leading a child. Tom had been restless and full of
  1499	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tchafings and repinings; conscience-smitten, too--he could not meet Amy
  1500	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tLawrence’s eye, he could not brook her loving gaze. But when he saw this
  1501	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsmall newcomer his soul was all ablaze with bliss in a moment. The next
  1502	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmoment he was “showing off” with all his might--cuffing boys, pulling
  1503	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thair, making faces--in a word, using every art that seemed likely to
  1504	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfascinate a girl and win her applause. His exaltation had but one
  1505	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\talloy--the memory of his humiliation in this angel’s garden--and that
  1506	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\trecord in sand was fast washing out, under the waves of happiness that
  1507	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twere sweeping over it now.
  1508	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1509	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe visitors were given the highest seat of honor, and as soon as Mr.
  1510	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tWalters’ speech was finished, he introduced them to the school. The
  1511	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmiddle-aged man turned out to be a prodigious personage--no less a one
  1512	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthan the county judge--altogether the most august creation these children
  1513	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thad ever looked upon--and they wondered what kind of material he was made
  1514	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof--and they half wanted to hear him roar, and were half afraid he might,
  1515	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttoo. He was from Constantinople, twelve miles away--so he had travelled,
  1516	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand seen the world--these very eyes had looked upon the county
  1517	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcourt-house--which was said to have a tin roof. The awe which these
  1518	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\treflections inspired was attested by the impressive silence and the
  1519	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tranks of staring eyes. This was the great Judge Thatcher, brother of
  1520	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttheir own lawyer. Jeff Thatcher immediately went forward, to be familiar
  1521	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twith the great man and be envied by the school. It would have been music
  1522	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto his soul to hear the whisperings:
  1523	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1524	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Look at him, Jim! He’s a going up there. Say--look! he’s a going to
  1525	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tshake hands with him--he _is_ shaking hands with him! By jings, don’t you
  1526	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twish you was Jeff?”
  1527	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1528	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tMr. Walters fell to “showing off,” with all sorts of official bustlings
  1529	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand activities, giving orders, delivering judgments, discharging
  1530	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdirections here, there, everywhere that he could find a target. The
  1531	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlibrarian “showed off”--running hither and thither with his arms full of
  1532	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbooks and making a deal of the splutter and fuss that insect authority
  1533	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdelights in. The young lady teachers “showed off”--bending sweetly over
  1534	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpupils that were lately being boxed, lifting pretty warning fingers
  1535	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tat bad little boys and patting good ones lovingly. The young gentlemen
  1536	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tteachers “showed off” with small scoldings and other little displays of
  1537	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tauthority and fine attention to discipline--and most of the teachers, of
  1538	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tboth sexes, found business up at the library, by the pulpit; and it was
  1539	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbusiness that frequently had to be done over again two or three times
  1540	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t(with much seeming vexation). The little girls “showed off” in various
  1541	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tways, and the little boys “showed off” with such diligence that the air
  1542	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas thick with paper wads and the murmur of scufflings. And above it
  1543	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tall the great man sat and beamed a majestic judicial smile upon all
  1544	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe house, and warmed himself in the sun of his own grandeur--for he was
  1545	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“showing off,” too.
  1546	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1547	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThere was only one thing wanting to make Mr. Walters’ ecstasy complete,
  1548	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand that was a chance to deliver a Bible-prize and exhibit a prodigy.
  1549	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tSeveral pupils had a few yellow tickets, but none had enough--he had been
  1550	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\taround among the star pupils inquiring. He would have given worlds, now,
  1551	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto have that German lad back again with a sound mind.
  1552	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1553	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd now at this moment, when hope was dead, Tom Sawyer came forward with
  1554	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnine yellow tickets, nine red tickets, and ten blue ones, and demanded
  1555	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta Bible. This was a thunderbolt out of a clear sky. Walters was not
  1556	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\texpecting an application from this source for the next ten years. But
  1557	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthere was no getting around it--here were the certified checks, and they
  1558	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twere good for their face. Tom was therefore elevated to a place with
  1559	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe Judge and the other elect, and the great news was announced from
  1560	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\theadquarters. It was the most stunning surprise of the decade, and
  1561	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tso profound was the sensation that it lifted the new hero up to the
  1562	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tjudicial one’s altitude, and the school had two marvels to gaze upon
  1563	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin place of one. The boys were all eaten up with envy--but those that
  1564	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsuffered the bitterest pangs were those who perceived too late that they
  1565	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthemselves had contributed to this hated splendor by trading tickets to
  1566	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom for the wealth he had amassed in selling whitewashing privileges.
  1567	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThese despised themselves, as being the dupes of a wily fraud, a
  1568	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tguileful snake in the grass.
  1569	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1570	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe prize was delivered to Tom with as much effusion as the
  1571	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsuperintendent could pump up under the circumstances; but it lacked
  1572	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsomewhat of the true gush, for the poor fellow’s instinct taught him
  1573	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat there was a mystery here that could not well bear the light,
  1574	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tperhaps; it was simply preposterous that this boy had warehoused two
  1575	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthousand sheaves of Scriptural wisdom on his premises--a dozen would
  1576	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstrain his capacity, without a doubt.
  1577	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1578	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAmy Lawrence was proud and glad, and she tried to make Tom see it in
  1579	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ther face--but he wouldn’t look. She wondered; then she was just a grain
  1580	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttroubled; next a dim suspicion came and went--came again; she watched;
  1581	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta furtive glance told her worlds--and then her heart broke, and she was
  1582	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tjealous, and angry, and the tears came and she hated everybody. Tom most
  1583	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof all (she thought).
  1584	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1585	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom was introduced to the Judge; but his tongue was tied, his breath
  1586	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twould hardly come, his heart quaked--partly because of the awful
  1587	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgreatness of the man, but mainly because he was her parent. He would
  1588	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thave liked to fall down and worship him, if it were in the dark. The
  1589	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tJudge put his hand on Tom’s head and called him a fine little man, and
  1590	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tasked him what his name was. The boy stammered, gasped, and got it out:
  1591	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1592	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tom.”
  1593	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1594	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, no, not Tom--it is--”
  1595	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1596	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Thomas.”
  1597	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1598	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Ah, that’s it. I thought there was more to it, maybe. That’s very well.
  1599	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBut you’ve another one I daresay, and you’ll tell it to me, won’t you?”
  1600	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1601	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tell the gentleman your other name, Thomas,” said Walters, “and say
  1602	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsir. You mustn’t forget your manners.”
  1603	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1604	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Thomas Sawyer--sir.”
  1605	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1606	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“That’s it! That’s a good boy. Fine boy. Fine, manly little fellow. Two
  1607	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthousand verses is a great many--very, very great many. And you never can
  1608	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbe sorry for the trouble you took to learn them; for knowledge is worth
  1609	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmore than anything there is in the world; it’s what makes great men
  1610	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand good men; you’ll be a great man and a good man yourself, some
  1611	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tday, Thomas, and then you’ll look back and say, It’s all owing to the
  1612	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tprecious Sunday-school privileges of my boyhood--it’s all owing to
  1613	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmy dear teachers that taught me to learn--it’s all owing to the good
  1614	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsuperintendent, who encouraged me, and watched over me, and gave me a
  1615	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbeautiful Bible--a splendid elegant Bible--to keep and have it all for my
  1616	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\town, always--it’s all owing to right bringing up! That is what you will
  1617	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsay, Thomas--and you wouldn’t take any money for those two thousand
  1618	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tverses--no indeed you wouldn’t. And now you wouldn’t mind telling me and
  1619	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthis lady some of the things you’ve learned--no, I know you wouldn’t--for
  1620	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twe are proud of little boys that learn. Now, no doubt you know the names
  1621	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof all the twelve disciples. Won’t you tell us the names of the first
  1622	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttwo that were appointed?”
  1623	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1624	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom was tugging at a button-hole and looking sheepish. He blushed,
  1625	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnow, and his eyes fell. Mr. Walters’ heart sank within him. He said
  1626	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto himself, it is not possible that the boy can answer the simplest
  1627	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tquestion--why _did_ the Judge ask him? Yet he felt obliged to speak up
  1628	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand say:
  1629	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1630	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Answer the gentleman, Thomas--don’t be afraid.”
  1631	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1632	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom still hung fire.
  1633	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1634	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now I know you’ll tell me,” said the lady. “The names of the first two
  1635	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdisciples were--”
  1636	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1637	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“_David And Goliah!_”
  1638	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1639	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tLet us draw the curtain of charity over the rest of the scene.
  1640	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t

  1644	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER V
  1645	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1646	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tABOUT half-past ten the cracked bell of the small church began to ring,
  1647	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand presently the people began to gather for the morning sermon. The
  1648	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tSunday-school children distributed themselves about the house and
  1649	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\toccupied pews with their parents, so as to be under supervision. Aunt
  1650	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tPolly came, and Tom and Sid and Mary sat with her--Tom being placed next
  1651	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe aisle, in order that he might be as far away from the open window
  1652	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand the seductive outside summer scenes as possible. The crowd filed up
  1653	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe aisles: the aged and needy postmaster, who had seen better days;
  1654	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe mayor and his wife--for they had a mayor there, among other
  1655	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tunnecessaries; the justice of the peace; the widow Douglass, fair,
  1656	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsmart, and forty, a generous, good-hearted soul and well-to-do, her hill
  1657	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmansion the only palace in the town, and the most hospitable and much
  1658	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe most lavish in the matter of festivities that St. Petersburg could
  1659	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tboast; the bent and venerable Major and Mrs. Ward; lawyer Riverson, the
  1660	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnew notable from a distance; next the belle of the village, followed by
  1661	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta troop of lawn-clad and ribbon-decked young heart-breakers; then all
  1662	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe young clerks in town in a body--for they had stood in the vestibule
  1663	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsucking their cane-heads, a circling wall of oiled and simpering
  1664	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tadmirers, till the last girl had run their gantlet; and last of all came
  1665	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe Model Boy, Willie Mufferson, taking as heedful care of his mother as
  1666	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tif she were cut glass. He always brought his mother to church, and was
  1667	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe pride of all the matrons. The boys all hated him, he was so
  1668	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgood. And besides, he had been “thrown up to them” so much. His
  1669	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhite handkerchief was hanging out of his pocket behind, as usual on
  1670	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tSundays--accidentally. Tom had no handkerchief, and he looked upon boys
  1671	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twho had as snobs.
  1672	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1673	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe congregation being fully assembled, now, the bell rang once more,
  1674	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto warn laggards and stragglers, and then a solemn hush fell upon the
  1675	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tchurch which was only broken by the tittering and whispering of the
  1676	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tchoir in the gallery. The choir always tittered and whispered all
  1677	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthrough service. There was once a church choir that was not ill-bred,
  1678	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbut I have forgotten where it was, now. It was a great many years ago,
  1679	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand I can scarcely remember anything about it, but I think it was in
  1680	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsome foreign country.
  1681	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1682	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe minister gave out the hymn, and read it through with a relish, in a
  1683	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpeculiar style which was much admired in that part of the country. His
  1684	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tvoice began on a medium key and climbed steadily up till it reached a
  1685	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcertain point, where it bore with strong emphasis upon the topmost word
  1686	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand then plunged down as if from a spring-board:
  1687	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1688	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tShall I be car-ri-ed toe the skies, on flow’ry _beds_ of ease,
  1689	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1690	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tWhilst others fight to win the prize, and sail thro’ _blood_-y seas?
  1691	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1692	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHe was regarded as a wonderful reader. At church “sociables” he was
  1693	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\talways called upon to read poetry; and when he was through, the ladies
  1694	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twould lift up their hands and let them fall helplessly in their laps,
  1695	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand “wall” their eyes, and shake their heads, as much as to say, “Words
  1696	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcannot express it; it is too beautiful, TOO beautiful for this mortal
  1697	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tearth.”
  1698	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1699	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAfter the hymn had been sung, the Rev. Mr. Sprague turned himself into
  1700	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta bulletin-board, and read off “notices” of meetings and societies and
  1701	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthings till it seemed that the list would stretch out to the crack of
  1702	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdoom--a queer custom which is still kept up in America, even in cities,
  1703	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\taway here in this age of abundant newspapers. Often, the less there is
  1704	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto justify a traditional custom, the harder it is to get rid of it.
  1705	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1706	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd now the minister prayed. A good, generous prayer it was, and went
  1707	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tinto details: it pleaded for the church, and the little children of the
  1708	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tchurch; for the other churches of the village; for the village itself;
  1709	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfor the county; for the State; for the State officers; for the United
  1710	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tStates; for the churches of the United States; for Congress; for the
  1711	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tPresident; for the officers of the Government; for poor sailors, tossed
  1712	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tby stormy seas; for the oppressed millions groaning under the heel of
  1713	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tEuropean monarchies and Oriental despotisms; for such as have the light
  1714	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand the good tidings, and yet have not eyes to see nor ears to hear
  1715	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twithal; for the heathen in the far islands of the sea; and closed with
  1716	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta supplication that the words he was about to speak might find grace
  1717	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand favor, and be as seed sown in fertile ground, yielding in time a
  1718	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgrateful harvest of good. Amen.
  1719	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1720	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThere was a rustling of dresses, and the standing congregation sat down.
  1721	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer, he
  1722	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tonly endured it--if he even did that much. He was restive all through it;
  1723	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\the kept tally of the details of the prayer, unconsciously--for he was not
  1724	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlistening, but he knew the ground of old, and the clergyman’s regular
  1725	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\troute over it--and when a little trifle of new matter was interlarded,
  1726	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\this ear detected it and his whole nature resented it; he considered
  1727	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tadditions unfair, and scoundrelly. In the midst of the prayer a fly had
  1728	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlit on the back of the pew in front of him and tortured his spirit by
  1729	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcalmly rubbing its hands together, embracing its head with its arms, and
  1730	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpolishing it so vigorously that it seemed to almost part company with
  1731	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe body, and the slender thread of a neck was exposed to view; scraping
  1732	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tits wings with its hind legs and smoothing them to its body as if they
  1733	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thad been coat-tails; going through its whole toilet as tranquilly as if
  1734	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tit knew it was perfectly safe. As indeed it was; for as sorely as Tom’s
  1735	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thands itched to grab for it they did not dare--he believed his soul would
  1736	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbe instantly destroyed if he did such a thing while the prayer was going
  1737	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ton. But with the closing sentence his hand began to curve and steal
  1738	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tforward; and the instant the “Amen” was out the fly was a prisoner of
  1739	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twar. His aunt detected the act and made him let it go.
  1740	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1741	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously through an
  1742	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\targument that was so prosy that many a head by and by began to nod--and
  1743	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tyet it was an argument that dealt in limitless fire and brimstone and
  1744	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthinned the predestined elect down to a company so small as to be hardly
  1745	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tworth the saving. Tom counted the pages of the sermon; after church he
  1746	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\talways knew how many pages there had been, but he seldom knew anything
  1747	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\telse about the discourse. However, this time he was really interested
  1748	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfor a little while. The minister made a grand and moving picture of the
  1749	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tassembling together of the world’s hosts at the millennium when the lion
  1750	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand the lamb should lie down together and a little child should lead
  1751	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthem. But the pathos, the lesson, the moral of the great spectacle
  1752	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twere lost upon the boy; he only thought of the conspicuousness of the
  1753	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tprincipal character before the on-looking nations; his face lit with the
  1754	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthought, and he said to himself that he wished he could be that child,
  1755	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tif it was a tame lion.
  1756	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1757	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tNow he lapsed into suffering again, as the dry argument was resumed.
  1758	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tPresently he bethought him of a treasure he had and got it out. It was
  1759	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta large black beetle with formidable jaws--a “pinchbug,” he called it. It
  1760	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas in a percussion-cap box. The first thing the beetle did was to
  1761	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttake him by the finger. A natural fillip followed, the beetle went
  1762	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfloundering into the aisle and lit on its back, and the hurt finger went
  1763	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tinto the boy’s mouth. The beetle lay there working its helpless legs,
  1764	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tunable to turn over. Tom eyed it, and longed for it; but it was safe out
  1765	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof his reach. Other people uninterested in the sermon found relief in
  1766	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe beetle, and they eyed it too. Presently a vagrant poodle dog came
  1767	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tidling along, sad at heart, lazy with the summer softness and the
  1768	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tquiet, weary of captivity, sighing for change. He spied the beetle; the
  1769	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdrooping tail lifted and wagged. He surveyed the prize; walked around
  1770	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tit; smelt at it from a safe distance; walked around it again; grew
  1771	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbolder, and took a closer smell; then lifted his lip and made a gingerly
  1772	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsnatch at it, just missing it; made another, and another; began to enjoy
  1773	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe diversion; subsided to his stomach with the beetle between his paws,
  1774	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand continued his experiments; grew weary at last, and then indifferent
  1775	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand absent-minded. His head nodded, and little by little his chin
  1776	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdescended and touched the enemy, who seized it. There was a sharp yelp,
  1777	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta flirt of the poodle’s head, and the beetle fell a couple of yards
  1778	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\taway, and lit on its back once more. The neighboring spectators
  1779	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tshook with a gentle inward joy, several faces went behind fans and
  1780	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thand-kerchiefs, and Tom was entirely happy. The dog looked foolish,
  1781	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand probably felt so; but there was resentment in his heart, too, and a
  1782	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcraving for revenge. So he went to the beetle and began a wary attack on
  1783	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tit again; jumping at it from every point of a circle, lighting with his
  1784	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfore-paws within an inch of the creature, making even closer snatches at
  1785	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tit with his teeth, and jerking his head till his ears flapped again. But
  1786	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\the grew tired once more, after a while; tried to amuse himself with a
  1787	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfly but found no relief; followed an ant around, with his nose close
  1788	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto the floor, and quickly wearied of that; yawned, sighed, forgot the
  1789	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbeetle entirely, and sat down on it. Then there was a wild yelp of agony
  1790	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand the poodle went sailing up the aisle; the yelps continued, and so
  1791	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdid the dog; he crossed the house in front of the altar; he flew
  1792	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdown the other aisle; he crossed before the doors; he clamored up the
  1793	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thome-stretch; his anguish grew with his progress, till presently he was
  1794	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbut a woolly comet moving in its orbit with the gleam and the speed of
  1795	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlight. At last the frantic sufferer sheered from its course, and sprang
  1796	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tinto its master’s lap; he flung it out of the window, and the voice of
  1797	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdistress quickly thinned away and died in the distance.
  1798	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1799	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBy this time the whole church was red-faced and suffocating with
  1800	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsuppressed laughter, and the sermon had come to a dead standstill.
  1801	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe discourse was resumed presently, but it went lame and halting, all
  1802	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpossibility of impressiveness being at an end; for even the gravest
  1803	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsentiments were constantly being received with a smothered burst of
  1804	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tunholy mirth, under cover of some remote pew-back, as if the poor parson
  1805	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thad said a rarely facetious thing. It was a genuine relief to the whole
  1806	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcongregation when the ordeal was over and the benediction pronounced.
  1807	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1808	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom Sawyer went home quite cheerful, thinking to himself that there was
  1809	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsome satisfaction about divine service when there was a bit of variety
  1810	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin it. He had but one marring thought; he was willing that the dog
  1811	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tshould play with his pinchbug, but he did not think it was upright in
  1812	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thim to carry it off.
  1813	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1814	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1815	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1816	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1817	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER VI
  1818	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1819	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tMONDAY morning found Tom Sawyer miserable. Monday morning always found
  1820	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thim so--because it began another week’s slow suffering in school. He
  1821	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgenerally began that day with wishing he had had no intervening holiday,
  1822	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tit made the going into captivity and fetters again so much more odious.
  1823	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1824	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom lay thinking. Presently it occurred to him that he wished he was
  1825	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsick; then he could stay home from school. Here was a vague possibility.
  1826	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHe canvassed his system. No ailment was found, and he investigated
  1827	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tagain. This time he thought he could detect colicky symptoms, and he
  1828	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbegan to encourage them with considerable hope. But they soon grew
  1829	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfeeble, and presently died wholly away. He reflected further. Suddenly
  1830	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\the discovered something. One of his upper front teeth was loose. This
  1831	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas lucky; he was about to begin to groan, as a “starter,” as he
  1832	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcalled it, when it occurred to him that if he came into court with that
  1833	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\targument, his aunt would pull it out, and that would hurt. So he thought
  1834	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\the would hold the tooth in reserve for the present, and seek further.
  1835	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tNothing offered for some little time, and then he remembered hearing
  1836	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe doctor tell about a certain thing that laid up a patient for two or
  1837	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthree weeks and threatened to make him lose a finger. So the boy eagerly
  1838	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdrew his sore toe from under the sheet and held it up for inspection.
  1839	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBut now he did not know the necessary symptoms. However, it seemed
  1840	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twell worth while to chance it, so he fell to groaning with considerable
  1841	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tspirit.
  1842	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1843	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBut Sid slept on unconscious.
  1844	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1845	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom groaned louder, and fancied that he began to feel pain in the toe.
  1846	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1847	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tNo result from Sid.
  1848	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1849	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom was panting with his exertions by this time. He took a rest and then
  1850	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tswelled himself up and fetched a succession of admirable groans.
  1851	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1852	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tSid snored on.
  1853	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1854	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom was aggravated. He said, “Sid, Sid!” and shook him. This course
  1855	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tworked well, and Tom began to groan again. Sid yawned, stretched, then
  1856	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbrought himself up on his elbow with a snort, and began to stare at Tom.
  1857	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom went on groaning. Sid said:
  1858	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1859	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tom! Say, Tom!” [No response.] “Here, Tom! TOM! What is the matter,
  1860	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom?” And he shook him and looked in his face anxiously.
  1861	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1862	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom moaned out:
  1863	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1864	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, don’t, Sid. Don’t joggle me.”
  1865	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1866	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, what’s the matter, Tom? I must call auntie.”
  1867	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1868	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No--never mind. It’ll be over by and by, maybe. Don’t call anybody.”
  1869	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1870	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“But I must! _Don’t_ groan so, Tom, it’s awful. How long you been this
  1871	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tway?”
  1872	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1873	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hours. Ouch! Oh, don’t stir so, Sid, you’ll kill me.”
  1874	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1875	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tom, why didn’t you wake me sooner? Oh, Tom, _don’t!_ It makes my flesh
  1876	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcrawl to hear you. Tom, what is the matter?”
  1877	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1878	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I forgive you everything, Sid. [Groan.] Everything you’ve ever done to
  1879	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tme. When I’m gone--”
  1880	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1881	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, Tom, you ain’t dying, are you? Don’t, Tom--oh, don’t. Maybe--”
  1882	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1883	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I forgive everybody, Sid. [Groan.] Tell ‘em so, Sid. And Sid, you give
  1884	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmy window-sash and my cat with one eye to that new girl that’s come to
  1885	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttown, and tell her--”
  1886	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1887	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBut Sid had snatched his clothes and gone. Tom was suffering in reality,
  1888	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnow, so handsomely was his imagination working, and so his groans had
  1889	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgathered quite a genuine tone.
  1890	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1891	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tSid flew downstairs and said:
  1892	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1893	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, Aunt Polly, come! Tom’s dying!”
  1894	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1895	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Dying!”
  1896	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1897	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes’m. Don’t wait--come quick!”
  1898	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1899	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Rubbage! I don’t believe it!”
  1900	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1901	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBut she fled upstairs, nevertheless, with Sid and Mary at her heels.
  1902	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd her face grew white, too, and her lip trembled. When she reached the
  1903	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbedside she gasped out:
  1904	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1905	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“You, Tom! Tom, what’s the matter with you?”
  1906	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1907	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, auntie, I’m--”
  1908	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1909	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“What’s the matter with you--what is the matter with you, child?”
  1910	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1911	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, auntie, my sore toe’s mortified!”
  1912	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1913	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe old lady sank down into a chair and laughed a little, then cried a
  1914	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlittle, then did both together. This restored her and she said:
  1915	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1916	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tom, what a turn you did give me. Now you shut up that nonsense and
  1917	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tclimb out of this.”
  1918	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1919	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe groans ceased and the pain vanished from the toe. The boy felt a
  1920	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlittle foolish, and he said:
  1921	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1922	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Aunt Polly, it _seemed_ mortified, and it hurt so I never minded my
  1923	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttooth at all.”
  1924	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1925	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Your tooth, indeed! What’s the matter with your tooth?”
  1926	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1927	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“One of them’s loose, and it aches perfectly awful.”
  1928	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1929	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“There, there, now, don’t begin that groaning again. Open your mouth.
  1930	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tWell--your tooth _is_ loose, but you’re not going to die about that.
  1931	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tMary, get me a silk thread, and a chunk of fire out of the kitchen.”
  1932	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1933	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom said:
  1934	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1935	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, please, auntie, don’t pull it out. It don’t hurt any more. I wish
  1936	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tI may never stir if it does. Please don’t, auntie. I don’t want to stay
  1937	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thome from school.”
  1938	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1939	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, you don’t, don’t you? So all this row was because you thought you’d
  1940	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tget to stay home from school and go a-fishing? Tom, Tom, I love you so,
  1941	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand you seem to try every way you can to break my old heart with your
  1942	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\toutrageousness.” By this time the dental instruments were ready. The old
  1943	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlady made one end of the silk thread fast to Tom’s tooth with a loop
  1944	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand tied the other to the bedpost. Then she seized the chunk of fire and
  1945	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsuddenly thrust it almost into the boy’s face. The tooth hung dangling
  1946	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tby the bedpost, now.
  1947	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1948	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBut all trials bring their compensations. As Tom wended to school after
  1949	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbreakfast, he was the envy of every boy he met because the gap in his
  1950	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tupper row of teeth enabled him to expectorate in a new and admirable
  1951	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tway. He gathered quite a following of lads interested in the exhibition;

  1953	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thomage up to this time, now found himself suddenly without an adherent,
  1954	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand shorn of his glory. His heart was heavy, and he said with a disdain
  1955	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhich he did not feel that it wasn’t anything to spit like Tom Sawyer;
  1956	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbut another boy said, “Sour grapes!” and he wandered away a dismantled
  1957	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thero.
  1958	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1959	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tShortly Tom came upon the juvenile pariah of the village, Huckleberry
  1960	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tFinn, son of the town drunkard. Huckleberry was cordially hated and
  1961	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdreaded by all the mothers of the town, because he was idle and lawless
  1962	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand vulgar and bad--and because all their children admired him so, and
  1963	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdelighted in his forbidden society, and wished they dared to be like
  1964	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thim. Tom was like the rest of the respectable boys, in that he envied
  1965	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHuckleberry his gaudy outcast condition, and was under strict orders
  1966	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnot to play with him. So he played with him every time he got a chance.
  1967	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHuckleberry was always dressed in the cast-off clothes of full-grown
  1968	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmen, and they were in perennial bloom and fluttering with rags. His hat
  1969	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas a vast ruin with a wide crescent lopped out of its brim; his coat,
  1970	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhen he wore one, hung nearly to his heels and had the rearward buttons
  1971	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfar down the back; but one suspender supported his trousers; the seat of
  1972	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe trousers bagged low and contained nothing, the fringed legs dragged
  1973	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin the dirt when not rolled up.
  1974	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1975	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHuckleberry came and went, at his own free will. He slept on doorsteps
  1976	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin fine weather and in empty hogsheads in wet; he did not have to go to
  1977	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tschool or to church, or call any being master or obey anybody; he could
  1978	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgo fishing or swimming when and where he chose, and stay as long as it
  1979	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsuited him; nobody forbade him to fight; he could sit up as late as he
  1980	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpleased; he was always the first boy that went barefoot in the spring
  1981	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand the last to resume leather in the fall; he never had to wash, nor
  1982	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tput on clean clothes; he could swear wonderfully. In a word, everything
  1983	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat goes to make life precious that boy had. So thought every harassed,
  1984	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thampered, respectable boy in St. Petersburg.
  1985	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1986	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom hailed the romantic outcast:
  1987	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1988	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hello, Huckleberry!”
  1989	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1990	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hello yourself, and see how you like it.”
  1991	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1992	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“What’s that you got?”
  1993	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1994	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Dead cat.”
  1995	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1996	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Lemme see him, Huck. My, he’s pretty stiff. Where’d you get him?”
  1997	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  1998	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Bought him off’n a boy.”
  1999	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2000	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“What did you give?”
  2001	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2002	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I give a blue ticket and a bladder that I got at the slaughter-house.”
  2003	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2004	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Where’d you get the blue ticket?”
  2005	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2006	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Bought it off’n Ben Rogers two weeks ago for a hoop-stick.”
  2007	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2008	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Say--what is dead cats good for, Huck?”
  2009	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2010	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Good for? Cure warts with.”
  2011	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2012	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No! Is that so? I know something that’s better.”
  2013	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2014	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I bet you don’t. What is it?”
  2015	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2016	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, spunk-water.”
  2017	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2018	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Spunk-water! I wouldn’t give a dern for spunk-water.”
  2019	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2020	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“You wouldn’t, wouldn’t you? D’you ever try it?”
  2021	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2022	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, I hain’t. But Bob Tanner did.”
  2023	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2024	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Who told you so!”
  2025	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2026	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, he told Jeff Thatcher, and Jeff told Johnny Baker, and Johnny
  2027	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttold Jim Hollis, and Jim told Ben Rogers, and Ben told a nigger, and the
  2028	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnigger told me. There now!”
  2029	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2030	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, what of it? They’ll all lie. Leastways all but the nigger. I

  2032	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tNow you tell me how Bob Tanner done it, Huck.”
  2033	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2034	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, he took and dipped his hand in a rotten stump where the rain-water
  2035	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas.”
  2036	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2037	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“In the daytime?”
  2038	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2039	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Certainly.”
  2040	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2041	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“With his face to the stump?”
  2042	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2043	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes. Least I reckon so.”
  2044	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2045	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Did he say anything?”
  2046	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2047	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I don’t reckon he did. I don’t know.”

  2049	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Aha! Talk about trying to cure warts with spunk-water such a blame fool
  2050	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tway as that! Why, that ain’t a-going to do any good. You got to go all
  2051	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tby yourself, to the middle of the woods, where you know there’s a
  2052	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tspunk-water stump, and just as it’s midnight you back up against the stump
  2053	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand jam your hand in and say:
  2054	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2055	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t‘Barley-corn, barley-corn, injun-meal shorts, Spunk-water, spunk-water,

  2057	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2058	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand then walk away quick, eleven steps, with your eyes shut, and then
  2059	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tturn around three times and walk home without speaking to anybody.
  2060	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBecause if you speak the charm’s busted.”
  2061	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2062	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, that sounds like a good way; but that ain’t the way Bob Tanner
  2063	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdone.”
  2064	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2065	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, sir, you can bet he didn’t, becuz he’s the wartiest boy in this
  2066	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttown; and he wouldn’t have a wart on him if he’d knowed how to work
  2067	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tspunk-water. I’ve took off thousands of warts off of my hands that way,
  2068	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHuck. I play with frogs so much that I’ve always got considerable many
  2069	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twarts. Sometimes I take ‘em off with a bean.”
  2070	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2071	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, bean’s good. I’ve done that.”
  2072	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2073	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Have you? What’s your way?”
  2074	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2075	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“You take and split the bean, and cut the wart so as to get some blood,
  2076	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand then you put the blood on one piece of the bean and take and dig
  2077	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta hole and bury it ‘bout midnight at the crossroads in the dark of the
  2078	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmoon, and then you burn up the rest of the bean. You see that piece
  2079	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat’s got the blood on it will keep drawing and drawing, trying to
  2080	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfetch the other piece to it, and so that helps the blood to draw the
  2081	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twart, and pretty soon off she comes.”
  2082	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2083	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, that’s it, Huck--that’s it; though when you’re burying it if you
  2084	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsay ‘Down bean; off wart; come no more to bother me!’ it’s better.
  2085	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThat’s the way Joe Harper does, and he’s been nearly to Coonville and
  2086	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmost everywheres. But say--how do you cure ‘em with dead cats?”
  2087	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2088	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, you take your cat and go and get in the grave-yard ‘long about

  2090	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmidnight a devil will come, or maybe two or three, but you can’t see
  2091	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t‘em, you can only hear something like the wind, or maybe hear ‘em talk;
  2092	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand when they’re taking that feller away, you heave your cat after ‘em
  2093	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand say, ‘Devil follow corpse, cat follow devil, warts follow cat, I’m
  2094	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdone with ye!’ That’ll fetch _any_ wart.”
  2095	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2096	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Sounds right. D’you ever try it, Huck?”
  2097	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2098	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, but old Mother Hopkins told me.”
  2099	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2100	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I reckon it’s so, then. Becuz they say she’s a witch.”
  2101	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2102	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Say! Why, Tom, I _know_ she is. She witched pap. Pap says so his own
  2103	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tself. He come along one day, and he see she was a-witching him, so he
  2104	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttook up a rock, and if she hadn’t dodged, he’d a got her. Well, that
  2105	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tvery night he rolled off’n a shed wher’ he was a layin drunk, and broke
  2106	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\this arm.”
  2107	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2108	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, that’s awful. How did he know she was a-witching him?”
  2109	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2110	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Lord, pap can tell, easy. Pap says when they keep looking at you right
  2111	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstiddy, they’re a-witching you. Specially if they mumble. Becuz when
  2112	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthey mumble they’re saying the Lord’s Prayer backards.”
  2113	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2114	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Say, Hucky, when you going to try the cat?”
  2115	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2116	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“To-night. I reckon they’ll come after old Hoss Williams to-night.”
  2117	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2118	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“But they buried him Saturday. Didn’t they get him Saturday night?”
  2119	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2120	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, how you talk! How could their charms work till midnight?--and
  2121	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t_then_ it’s Sunday. Devils don’t slosh around much of a Sunday, I don’t

  2123	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2124	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I never thought of that. That’s so. Lemme go with you?”

  2126	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Of course--if you ain’t afeard.”
  2127	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2128	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Afeard! ‘Tain’t likely. Will you meow?”
  2129	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2130	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes--and you meow back, if you get a chance. Last time, you kep’ me
  2131	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta-meowing around till old Hays went to throwing rocks at me and says
  2132	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t‘Dern that cat!’ and so I hove a brick through his window--but don’t you

  2134	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2135	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I won’t. I couldn’t meow that night, becuz auntie was watching me, but

  2137	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2138	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Nothing but a tick.”
  2139	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2140	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Where’d you get him?”
  2141	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2142	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Out in the woods.”
  2143	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2144	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“What’ll you take for him?”
  2145	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2146	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I don’t know. I don’t want to sell him.”
  2147	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2148	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right. It’s a mighty small tick, anyway.”
  2149	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2150	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, anybody can run a tick down that don’t belong to them. I’m
  2151	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsatisfied with it. It’s a good enough tick for me.”
  2152	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2153	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Sho, there’s ticks a plenty. I could have a thousand of ‘em if I wanted

  2155	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2156	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, why don’t you? Becuz you know mighty well you can’t. This is a
  2157	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpretty early tick, I reckon. It’s the first one I’ve seen this year.”
  2158	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2159	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Say, Huck--I’ll give you my tooth for him.”
  2160	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2161	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Less see it.”
  2162	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2163	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom got out a bit of paper and carefully unrolled it. Huckleberry viewed
  2164	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tit wistfully. The temptation was very strong. At last he said:
  2165	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2166	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Is it genuwyne?”
  2167	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2168	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom lifted his lip and showed the vacancy.
  2169	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2170	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, all right,” said Huckleberry, “it’s a trade.”
  2171	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2172	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom enclosed the tick in the percussion-cap box that had lately been the
  2173	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpinchbug’s prison, and the boys separated, each feeling wealthier than
  2174	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore.
  2175	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2176	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen Tom reached the little isolated frame school-house, he strode in
  2177	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbriskly, with the manner of one who had come with all honest speed. He
  2178	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thung his hat on a peg and flung himself into his seat with business-like
  2179	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\talacrity. The master, throned on high in his great splint-bottom
  2180	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tarm-chair, was dozing, lulled by the drowsy hum of study. The
  2181	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tinterruption roused him.
  2182	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2183	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Thomas Sawyer!”
  2184	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2185	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom knew that when his name was pronounced in full, it meant trouble.
  2186	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2187	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Sir!”
  2188	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2189	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Come up here. Now, sir, why are you late again, as usual?”
  2190	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2191	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom was about to take refuge in a lie, when he saw two long tails of
  2192	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tyellow hair hanging down a back that he recognized by the electric
  2193	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsympathy of love; and by that form was _the only vacant place_ on the
  2194	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgirls’ side of the school-house. He instantly said:
  2195	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2196	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“_I stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn!_”
  2197	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2198	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe master’s pulse stood still, and he stared helplessly. The buzz of
  2199	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstudy ceased. The pupils wondered if this foolhardy boy had lost his
  2200	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmind. The master said:
  2201	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2202	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“You--you did what?”
  2203	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2204	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn.”
  2205	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2206	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThere was no mistaking the words.
  2207	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2208	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Thomas Sawyer, this is the most astounding confession I have ever
  2209	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlistened to. No mere ferule will answer for this offence. Take off your
  2210	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tjacket.”
  2211	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2212	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe master’s arm performed until it was tired and the stock of switches
  2213	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnotably diminished. Then the order followed:
  2214	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2215	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now, sir, go and sit with the girls! And let this be a warning to you.”
  2216	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2217	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe titter that rippled around the room appeared to abash the boy, but
  2218	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin reality that result was caused rather more by his worshipful awe
  2219	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof his unknown idol and the dread pleasure that lay in his high good
  2220	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfortune. He sat down upon the end of the pine bench and the girl hitched
  2221	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\therself away from him with a toss of her head. Nudges and winks and
  2222	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhispers traversed the room, but Tom sat still, with his arms upon the
  2223	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlong, low desk before him, and seemed to study his book.
  2224	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2225	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBy and by attention ceased from him, and the accustomed school murmur
  2226	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\trose upon the dull air once more. Presently the boy began to steal
  2227	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfurtive glances at the girl. She observed it, “made a mouth” at him
  2228	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand gave him the back of her head for the space of a minute. When she
  2229	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcautiously faced around again, a peach lay before her. She thrust it
  2230	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\taway. Tom gently put it back. She thrust it away again, but with less
  2231	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tanimosity. Tom patiently returned it to its place. Then she let it
  2232	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tremain. Tom scrawled on his slate, “Please take it--I got more.” The
  2233	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgirl glanced at the words, but made no sign. Now the boy began to draw
  2234	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsomething on the slate, hiding his work with his left hand. For a time
  2235	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe girl refused to notice; but her human curiosity presently began
  2236	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto manifest itself by hardly perceptible signs. The boy worked on,
  2237	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tapparently unconscious. The girl made a sort of non-committal attempt
  2238	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto see, but the boy did not betray that he was aware of it. At last she
  2239	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgave in and hesitatingly whispered:
  2240	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2241	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Let me see it.”
  2242	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2243	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom partly uncovered a dismal caricature of a house with two gable ends
  2244	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto it and a corkscrew of smoke issuing from the chimney. Then the girl’s
  2245	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tinterest began to fasten itself upon the work and she forgot everything
  2246	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\telse. When it was finished, she gazed a moment, then whispered:
  2247	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2248	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s nice--make a man.”
  2249	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2250	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe artist erected a man in the front yard, that resembled a derrick. He
  2251	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcould have stepped over the house; but the girl was not hypercritical;
  2252	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tshe was satisfied with the monster, and whispered:
  2253	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2254	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s a beautiful man--now make me coming along.”
  2255	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2256	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom drew an hour-glass with a full moon and straw limbs to it and armed
  2257	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe spreading fingers with a portentous fan. The girl said:
  2258	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2259	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s ever so nice--I wish I could draw.”
  2260	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2261	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s easy,” whispered Tom, “I’ll learn you.”
  2262	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2263	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, will you? When?”
  2264	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2265	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“At noon. Do you go home to dinner?”
  2266	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2267	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’ll stay if you will.”
  2268	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2269	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Good--that’s a whack. What’s your name?”
  2270	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2271	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Becky Thatcher. What’s yours? Oh, I know. It’s Thomas Sawyer.”
  2272	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2273	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“That’s the name they lick me by. I’m Tom when I’m good. You call me
  2274	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom, will you?”
  2275	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2276	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes.”
  2277	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2278	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tNow Tom began to scrawl something on the slate, hiding the words from
  2279	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe girl. But she was not backward this time. She begged to see. Tom
  2280	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid:
  2281	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2282	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, it ain’t anything.”
  2283	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2284	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes it is.”
  2285	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2286	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No it ain’t. You don’t want to see.”
  2287	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2288	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes I do, indeed I do. Please let me.”
  2289	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2290	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“You’ll tell.”
  2291	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2292	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No I won’t--deed and deed and double deed won’t.”
  2293	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2294	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“You won’t tell anybody at all? Ever, as long as you live?”
  2295	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2296	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, I won’t ever tell _any_body. Now let me.”
  2297	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2298	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, _you_ don’t want to see!”
  2299	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2300	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now that you treat me so, I _will_ see.” And she put her small hand
  2301	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tupon his and a little scuffle ensued, Tom pretending to resist in
  2302	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tearnest but letting his hand slip by degrees till these words were
  2303	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\trevealed: “_I love you_.”
  2304	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2305	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, you bad thing!” And she hit his hand a smart rap, but reddened and
  2306	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlooked pleased, nevertheless.
  2307	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2308	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tJust at this juncture the boy felt a slow, fateful grip closing on his
  2309	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tear, and a steady lifting impulse. In that wise he was borne across the
  2310	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thouse and deposited in his own seat, under a peppering fire of giggles
  2311	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfrom the whole school. Then the master stood over him during a few awful
  2312	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmoments, and finally moved away to his throne without saying a word. But
  2313	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\talthough Tom’s ear tingled, his heart was jubilant.
  2314	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2315	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAs the school quieted down Tom made an honest effort to study, but
  2316	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe turmoil within him was too great. In turn he took his place in the
  2317	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\treading class and made a botch of it; then in the geography class and
  2318	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tturned lakes into mountains, mountains into rivers, and rivers into
  2319	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcontinents, till chaos was come again; then in the spelling class, and
  2320	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgot “turned down,” by a succession of mere baby words, till he brought
  2321	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tup at the foot and yielded up the pewter medal which he had worn with
  2322	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tostentation for months.
  2323	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2324	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2325	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2326	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2327	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER VII
  2328	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2329	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTHE harder Tom tried to fasten his mind on his book, the more his ideas
  2330	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twandered. So at last, with a sigh and a yawn, he gave it up. It seemed
  2331	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto him that the noon recess would never come. The air was utterly dead.
  2332	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThere was not a breath stirring. It was the sleepiest of sleepy days.
  2333	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe drowsing murmur of the five and twenty studying scholars soothed
  2334	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe soul like the spell that is in the murmur of bees. Away off in the
  2335	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tflaming sunshine, Cardiff Hill lifted its soft green sides through a
  2336	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tshimmering veil of heat, tinted with the purple of distance; a few birds
  2337	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfloated on lazy wing high in the air; no other living thing was visible
  2338	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbut some cows, and they were asleep. Tom’s heart ached to be free, or
  2339	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\telse to have something of interest to do to pass the dreary time.
  2340	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHis hand wandered into his pocket and his face lit up with a glow of
  2341	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgratitude that was prayer, though he did not know it. Then furtively
  2342	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe percussion-cap box came out. He released the tick and put him on
  2343	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe long flat desk. The creature probably glowed with a gratitude that
  2344	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tamounted to prayer, too, at this moment, but it was premature: for when
  2345	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\the started thankfully to travel off, Tom turned him aside with a pin and
  2346	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmade him take a new direction.
  2347	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2348	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom’s bosom friend sat next him, suffering just as Tom had been, and
  2349	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnow he was deeply and gratefully interested in this entertainment in
  2350	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tan instant. This bosom friend was Joe Harper. The two boys were sworn
  2351	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfriends all the week, and embattled enemies on Saturdays. Joe took a
  2352	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpin out of his lapel and began to assist in exercising the prisoner.
  2353	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe sport grew in interest momently. Soon Tom said that they were
  2354	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tinterfering with each other, and neither getting the fullest benefit
  2355	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof the tick. So he put Joe’s slate on the desk and drew a line down the
  2356	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmiddle of it from top to bottom.
  2357	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2358	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now,” said he, “as long as he is on your side you can stir him up and
  2359	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tI’ll let him alone; but if you let him get away and get on my side,
  2360	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tyou’re to leave him alone as long as I can keep him from crossing over.”
  2361	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2362	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right, go ahead; start him up.”
  2363	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2364	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe tick escaped from Tom, presently, and crossed the equator. Joe
  2365	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tharassed him awhile, and then he got away and crossed back again. This
  2366	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tchange of base occurred often. While one boy was worrying the tick with
  2367	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tabsorbing interest, the other would look on with interest as strong, the
  2368	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttwo heads bowed together over the slate, and the two souls dead to all
  2369	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthings else. At last luck seemed to settle and abide with Joe. The
  2370	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttick tried this, that, and the other course, and got as excited and as
  2371	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tanxious as the boys themselves, but time and again just as he would
  2372	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thave victory in his very grasp, so to speak, and Tom’s fingers would
  2373	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbe twitching to begin, Joe’s pin would deftly head him off, and keep
  2374	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpossession. At last Tom could stand it no longer. The temptation was too
  2375	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstrong. So he reached out and lent a hand with his pin. Joe was angry in
  2376	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta moment. Said he:
  2377	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2378	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tom, you let him alone.”
  2379	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2380	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I only just want to stir him up a little, Joe.”
  2381	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2382	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, sir, it ain’t fair; you just let him alone.”
  2383	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2384	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Blame it, I ain’t going to stir him much.”
  2385	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2386	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Let him alone, I tell you.”
  2387	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2388	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I won’t!”
  2389	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2390	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“You shall--he’s on my side of the line.”
  2391	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2392	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Look here, Joe Harper, whose is that tick?”
  2393	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2394	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I don’t care whose tick he is--he’s on my side of the line, and you
  2395	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsha’n’t touch him.”
  2396	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2397	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I’ll just bet I will, though. He’s my tick and I’ll do what I
  2398	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tblame please with him, or die!”
  2399	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2400	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tA tremendous whack came down on Tom’s shoulders, and its duplicate on
  2401	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tJoe’s; and for the space of two minutes the dust continued to fly from
  2402	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe two jackets and the whole school to enjoy it. The boys had been
  2403	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttoo absorbed to notice the hush that had stolen upon the school awhile
  2404	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore when the master came tiptoeing down the room and stood over them.
  2405	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHe had contemplated a good part of the performance before he contributed
  2406	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\this bit of variety to it.
  2407	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2408	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen school broke up at noon, Tom flew to Becky Thatcher, and whispered
  2409	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin her ear:
  2410	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2411	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Put on your bonnet and let on you’re going home; and when you get to
  2412	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe corner, give the rest of ‘em the slip, and turn down through the
  2413	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlane and come back. I’ll go the other way and come it over ‘em the same
  2414	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tway.”
  2415	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2416	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tSo the one went off with one group of scholars, and the other with
  2417	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tanother. In a little while the two met at the bottom of the lane, and
  2418	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhen they reached the school they had it all to themselves. Then they
  2419	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsat together, with a slate before them, and Tom gave Becky the pencil
  2420	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand held her hand in his, guiding it, and so created another surprising
  2421	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thouse. When the interest in art began to wane, the two fell to talking.
  2422	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom was swimming in bliss. He said:
  2423	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2424	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Do you love rats?”
  2425	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2426	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No! I hate them!”
  2427	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2428	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I do, too--_live_ ones. But I mean dead ones, to swing round your
  2429	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thead with a string.”
  2430	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2431	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, I don’t care for rats much, anyway. What I like is chewing-gum.”
  2432	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2433	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, I should say so! I wish I had some now.”

  2435	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Do you? I’ve got some. I’ll let you chew it awhile, but you must give
  2436	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tit back to me.”
  2437	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2438	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThat was agreeable, so they chewed it turn about, and dangled their legs
  2439	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tagainst the bench in excess of contentment.
  2440	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2441	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Was you ever at a circus?” said Tom.
  2442	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2443	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, and my pa’s going to take me again some time, if I’m good.”
  2444	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2445	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I been to the circus three or four times--lots of times. Church ain’t
  2446	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tshucks to a circus. There’s things going on at a circus all the time.
  2447	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tI’m going to be a clown in a circus when I grow up.”
  2448	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2449	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, are you! That will be nice. They’re so lovely, all spotted up.”
  2450	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2451	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, that’s so. And they get slathers of money--most a dollar a day, Ben
  2452	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tRogers says. Say, Becky, was you ever engaged?”
  2453	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2454	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“What’s that?”
  2455	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2456	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, engaged to be married.”
  2457	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2458	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No.”
  2459	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2460	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Would you like to?”
  2461	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2462	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I reckon so. I don’t know. What is it like?”
  2463	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2464	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Like? Why it ain’t like anything. You only just tell a boy you won’t
  2465	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tever have anybody but him, ever ever ever, and then you kiss and that’s
  2466	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tall. Anybody can do it.”
  2467	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2468	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Kiss? What do you kiss for?”
  2469	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2470	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, that, you know, is to--well, they always do that.”
  2471	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2472	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Everybody?”
  2473	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2474	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, yes, everybody that’s in love with each other. Do you remember
  2475	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhat I wrote on the slate?”
  2476	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2477	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Ye--yes.”
  2478	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2479	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“What was it?”
  2480	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2481	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I sha’n’t tell you.”
  2482	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2483	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Shall I tell _you_?”
  2484	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2485	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Ye--yes--but some other time.”
  2486	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2487	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, now.”
  2488	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2489	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, not now--to-morrow.”
  2490	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2491	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, no, _now_. Please, Becky--I’ll whisper it, I’ll whisper it ever so
  2492	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\teasy.”
  2493	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2494	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBecky hesitating, Tom took silence for consent, and passed his arm about
  2495	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ther waist and whispered the tale ever so softly, with his mouth close to
  2496	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ther ear. And then he added:
  2497	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2498	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now you whisper it to me--just the same.”
  2499	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2500	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tShe resisted, for a while, and then said:
  2501	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2502	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“You turn your face away so you can’t see, and then I will. But you
  2503	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmustn’t ever tell anybody--_will_ you, Tom? Now you won’t, _will_ you?”
  2504	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2505	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, indeed, indeed I won’t. Now, Becky.”
  2506	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2507	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHe turned his face away. She bent timidly around till her breath stirred
  2508	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\this curls and whispered, “I--love--you!”
  2509	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2510	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThen she sprang away and ran around and around the desks and benches,
  2511	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twith Tom after her, and took refuge in a corner at last, with her little
  2512	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhite apron to her face. Tom clasped her about her neck and pleaded:
  2513	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2514	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now, Becky, it’s all done--all over but the kiss. Don’t you be afraid
  2515	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof that--it ain’t anything at all. Please, Becky.” And he tugged at her
  2516	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tapron and the hands.
  2517	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2518	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBy and by she gave up, and let her hands drop; her face, all glowing
  2519	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twith the struggle, came up and submitted. Tom kissed the red lips and
  2520	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid:
  2521	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2522	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now it’s all done, Becky. And always after this, you know, you ain’t
  2523	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tever to love anybody but me, and you ain’t ever to marry anybody but me,
  2524	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tever never and forever. Will you?”
  2525	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2526	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, I’ll never love anybody but you, Tom, and I’ll never marry anybody
  2527	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbut you--and you ain’t to ever marry anybody but me, either.”
  2528	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2529	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Certainly. Of course. That’s _part_ of it. And always coming to school
  2530	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tor when we’re going home, you’re to walk with me, when there ain’t
  2531	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tanybody looking--and you choose me and I choose you at parties, because
  2532	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat’s the way you do when you’re engaged.”
  2533	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2534	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s so nice. I never heard of it before.”
  2535	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2536	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, it’s ever so gay! Why, me and Amy Lawrence--”
  2537	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2538	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe big eyes told Tom his blunder and he stopped, confused.
  2539	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2540	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, Tom! Then I ain’t the first you’ve ever been engaged to!”
  2541	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2542	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe child began to cry. Tom said:
  2543	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2544	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, don’t cry, Becky, I don’t care for her any more.”
  2545	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2546	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, you do, Tom--you know you do.”
  2547	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2548	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom tried to put his arm about her neck, but she pushed him away and
  2549	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tturned her face to the wall, and went on crying. Tom tried again, with
  2550	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsoothing words in his mouth, and was repulsed again. Then his pride was
  2551	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tup, and he strode away and went outside. He stood about, restless and
  2552	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tuneasy, for a while, glancing at the door, every now and then, hoping
  2553	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tshe would repent and come to find him. But she did not. Then he began
  2554	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto feel badly and fear that he was in the wrong. It was a hard struggle
  2555	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twith him to make new advances, now, but he nerved himself to it and
  2556	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tentered. She was still standing back there in the corner, sobbing, with
  2557	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ther face to the wall. Tom’s heart smote him. He went to her and stood a
  2558	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmoment, not knowing exactly how to proceed. Then he said hesitatingly:
  2559	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2560	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Becky, I--I don’t care for anybody but you.”
  2561	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2562	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tNo reply--but sobs.
  2563	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2564	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Becky”--pleadingly. “Becky, won’t you say something?”
  2565	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2566	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tMore sobs.
  2567	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2568	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom got out his chiefest jewel, a brass knob from the top of an andiron,
  2569	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand passed it around her so that she could see it, and said:
  2570	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2571	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Please, Becky, won’t you take it?”
  2572	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2573	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tShe struck it to the floor. Then Tom marched out of the house and over
  2574	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe hills and far away, to return to school no more that day. Presently
  2575	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBecky began to suspect. She ran to the door; he was not in sight; she
  2576	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tflew around to the play-yard; he was not there. Then she called:
  2577	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2578	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tom! Come back, Tom!”
  2579	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2580	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tShe listened intently, but there was no answer. She had no companions
  2581	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbut silence and loneliness. So she sat down to cry again and upbraid
  2582	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\therself; and by this time the scholars began to gather again, and she
  2583	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thad to hide her griefs and still her broken heart and take up the cross
  2584	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof a long, dreary, aching afternoon, with none among the strangers about
  2585	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ther to exchange sorrows with.
  2586	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2587	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2588	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2589	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2590	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER VIII
  2591	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2592	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTOM dodged hither and thither through lanes until he was well out of the
  2593	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttrack of returning scholars, and then fell into a moody jog. He crossed
  2594	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta small “branch” two or three times, because of a prevailing juvenile
  2595	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsuperstition that to cross water baffled pursuit. Half an hour later
  2596	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\the was disappearing behind the Douglas mansion on the summit of Cardiff
  2597	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHill, and the school-house was hardly distinguishable away off in the
  2598	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tvalley behind him. He entered a dense wood, picked his pathless way to
  2599	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe centre of it, and sat down on a mossy spot under a spreading oak.
  2600	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThere was not even a zephyr stirring; the dead noonday heat had even
  2601	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstilled the songs of the birds; nature lay in a trance that was broken
  2602	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tby no sound but the occasional far-off hammering of a wood-pecker, and
  2603	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthis seemed to render the pervading silence and sense of loneliness the
  2604	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmore profound. The boy’s soul was steeped in melancholy; his feelings
  2605	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twere in happy accord with his surroundings. He sat long with his elbows
  2606	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ton his knees and his chin in his hands, meditating. It seemed to him
  2607	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat life was but a trouble, at best, and he more than half envied Jimmy
  2608	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHodges, so lately released; it must be very peaceful, he thought, to lie
  2609	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand slumber and dream forever and ever, with the wind whispering through
  2610	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe trees and caressing the grass and the flowers over the grave, and
  2611	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnothing to bother and grieve about, ever any more. If he only had a
  2612	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tclean Sunday-school record he could be willing to go, and be done with
  2613	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tit all. Now as to this girl. What had he done? Nothing. He had meant
  2614	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe best in the world, and been treated like a dog--like a very dog. She
  2615	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twould be sorry some day--maybe when it was too late. Ah, if he could only
  2616	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdie _temporarily_!
  2617	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2618	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBut the elastic heart of youth cannot be compressed into one constrained
  2619	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tshape long at a time. Tom presently began to drift insensibly back into
  2620	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe concerns of this life again. What if he turned his back, now, and
  2621	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdisappeared mysteriously? What if he went away--ever so far away, into
  2622	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tunknown countries beyond the seas--and never came back any more! How
  2623	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twould she feel then! The idea of being a clown recurred to him now, only
  2624	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto fill him with disgust. For frivolity and jokes and spotted tights
  2625	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twere an offense, when they intruded themselves upon a spirit that was
  2626	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\texalted into the vague august realm of the romantic. No, he would be
  2627	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta soldier, and return after long years, all war-worn and illustrious.
  2628	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tNo--better still, he would join the Indians, and hunt buffaloes and go on
  2629	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe warpath in the mountain ranges and the trackless great plains of the
  2630	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tFar West, and away in the future come back a great chief, bristling with
  2631	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfeathers, hideous with paint, and prance into Sunday-school, some drowsy
  2632	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsummer morning, with a blood-curdling war-whoop, and sear the eyeballs
  2633	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof all his companions with unappeasable envy. But no, there was
  2634	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsomething gaudier even than this. He would be a pirate! That was it!
  2635	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t_now_ his future lay plain before him, and glowing with unimaginable
  2636	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsplendor. How his name would fill the world, and make people shudder!
  2637	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHow gloriously he would go plowing the dancing seas, in his long, low,
  2638	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tblack-hulled racer, the Spirit of the Storm, with his grisly flag flying
  2639	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tat the fore! And at the zenith of his fame, how he would suddenly appear
  2640	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tat the old village and stalk into church, brown and weather-beaten, in
  2641	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\this black velvet doublet and trunks, his great jack-boots, his crimson
  2642	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsash, his belt bristling with horse-pistols, his crime-rusted cutlass
  2643	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tat his side, his slouch hat with waving plumes, his black flag unfurled,
  2644	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twith the skull and crossbones on it, and hear with swelling ecstasy
  2645	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe whisperings, “It’s Tom Sawyer the Pirate!--the Black Avenger of the
  2646	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tSpanish Main!”
  2647	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2648	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tYes, it was settled; his career was determined. He would run away from
  2649	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thome and enter upon it. He would start the very next morning. Therefore
  2650	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\the must now begin to get ready. He would collect his resources together.
  2651	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHe went to a rotten log near at hand and began to dig under one end of
  2652	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tit with his Barlow knife. He soon struck wood that sounded hollow. He
  2653	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tput his hand there and uttered this incantation impressively:
  2654	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2655	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“What hasn’t come here, come! What’s here, stay here!”
  2656	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2657	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThen he scraped away the dirt, and exposed a pine shingle. He took it
  2658	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tup and disclosed a shapely little treasure-house whose bottom and sides
  2659	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twere of shingles. In it lay a marble. Tom’s astonishment was bound-less!
  2660	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHe scratched his head with a perplexed air, and said:
  2661	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2662	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, that beats anything!”
  2663	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2664	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThen he tossed the marble away pettishly, and stood cogitating. The
  2665	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttruth was, that a superstition of his had failed, here, which he and
  2666	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tall his comrades had always looked upon as infallible. If you buried
  2667	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta marble with certain necessary incantations, and left it alone a
  2668	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfortnight, and then opened the place with the incantation he had just
  2669	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tused, you would find that all the marbles you had ever lost had gathered
  2670	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthemselves together there, meantime, no matter how widely they had been
  2671	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tseparated. But now, this thing had actually and unquestionably failed.
  2672	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom’s whole structure of faith was shaken to its foundations. He had
  2673	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmany a time heard of this thing succeeding but never of its failing
  2674	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore. It did not occur to him that he had tried it several times
  2675	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore, himself, but could never find the hiding-places afterward. He
  2676	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpuzzled over the matter some time, and finally decided that some witch
  2677	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thad interfered and broken the charm. He thought he would satisfy himself
  2678	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ton that point; so he searched around till he found a small sandy spot
  2679	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twith a little funnel-shaped depression in it. He laid himself down and
  2680	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tput his mouth close to this depression and called--
  2681	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2682	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Doodle-bug, doodle-bug, tell me what I want to know! Doodle-bug,
  2683	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdoodle-bug, tell me what I want to know!”
  2684	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2685	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe sand began to work, and presently a small black bug appeared for a
  2686	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsecond and then darted under again in a fright.
  2687	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2688	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“He dasn’t tell! So it _was_ a witch that done it. I just knowed it.”
  2689	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2690	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHe well knew the futility of trying to contend against witches, so he
  2691	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgave up discouraged. But it occurred to him that he might as well have
  2692	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe marble he had just thrown away, and therefore he went and made a
  2693	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpatient search for it. But he could not find it. Now he went back to his
  2694	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttreasure-house and carefully placed himself just as he had been standing
  2695	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhen he tossed the marble away; then he took another marble from his
  2696	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpocket and tossed it in the same way, saying:
  2697	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2698	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Brother, go find your brother!”
  2699	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2700	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHe watched where it stopped, and went there and looked. But it must
  2701	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thave fallen short or gone too far; so he tried twice more. The last
  2702	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\trepetition was successful. The two marbles lay within a foot of each
  2703	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tother.
  2704	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2705	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tJust here the blast of a toy tin trumpet came faintly down the green
  2706	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\taisles of the forest. Tom flung off his jacket and trousers, turned
  2707	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta suspender into a belt, raked away some brush behind the rotten log,
  2708	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdisclosing a rude bow and arrow, a lath sword and a tin trumpet, and
  2709	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin a moment had seized these things and bounded away, barelegged,
  2710	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twith fluttering shirt. He presently halted under a great elm, blew an
  2711	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tanswering blast, and then began to tiptoe and look warily out, this way
  2712	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand that. He said cautiously--to an imaginary company:
  2713	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2714	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hold, my merry men! Keep hid till I blow.”
  2715	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2716	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tNow appeared Joe Harper, as airily clad and elaborately armed as Tom.
  2717	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom called:
  2718	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2719	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hold! Who comes here into Sherwood Forest without my pass?”
  2720	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2721	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Guy of Guisborne wants no man’s pass. Who art thou that--that--”
  2722	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2723	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Dares to hold such language,” said Tom, prompting--for they talked “by
  2724	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe book,” from memory.
  2725	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2726	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Who art thou that dares to hold such language?”
  2727	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2728	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I, indeed! I am Robin Hood, as thy caitiff carcase soon shall know.”
  2729	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2730	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Then art thou indeed that famous outlaw? Right gladly will I dispute
  2731	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twith thee the passes of the merry wood. Have at thee!”
  2732	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2733	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThey took their lath swords, dumped their other traps on the ground,
  2734	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstruck a fencing attitude, foot to foot, and began a grave, careful
  2735	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcombat, “two up and two down.” Presently Tom said:
  2736	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2737	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now, if you’ve got the hang, go it lively!”
  2738	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2739	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tSo they “went it lively,” panting and perspiring with the work. By and
  2740	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tby Tom shouted:
  2741	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2742	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Fall! fall! Why don’t you fall?”
  2743	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2744	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I sha’n’t! Why don’t you fall yourself? You’re getting the worst of
  2745	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tit.”
  2746	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2747	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, that ain’t anything. I can’t fall; that ain’t the way it is in the
  2748	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbook. The book says, ‘Then with one back-handed stroke he slew poor Guy
  2749	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof Guisborne.’ You’re to turn around and let me hit you in the back.”
  2750	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2751	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThere was no getting around the authorities, so Joe turned, received the
  2752	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhack and fell.
  2753	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2754	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now,” said Joe, getting up, “you got to let me kill _you_. That’s
  2755	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfair.”
  2756	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2757	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, I can’t do that, it ain’t in the book.”
  2758	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2759	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, it’s blamed mean--that’s all.”
  2760	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2761	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, say, Joe, you can be Friar Tuck or Much the miller’s son, and lam
  2762	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tme with a quarter-staff; or I’ll be the Sheriff of Nottingham and you be
  2763	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tRobin Hood a little while and kill me.”
  2764	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2765	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThis was satisfactory, and so these adventures were carried out. Then
  2766	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom became Robin Hood again, and was allowed by the treacherous nun to
  2767	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbleed his strength away through his neglected wound. And at last Joe,
  2768	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\trepresenting a whole tribe of weeping outlaws, dragged him sadly forth,
  2769	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgave his bow into his feeble hands, and Tom said, “Where this arrow
  2770	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfalls, there bury poor Robin Hood under the greenwood tree.” Then he
  2771	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tshot the arrow and fell back and would have died, but he lit on a nettle
  2772	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand sprang up too gaily for a corpse.
  2773	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2774	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe boys dressed themselves, hid their accoutrements, and went off
  2775	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgrieving that there were no outlaws any more, and wondering what modern
  2776	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcivilization could claim to have done to compensate for their loss.
  2777	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThey said they would rather be outlaws a year in Sherwood Forest than
  2778	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tPresident of the United States forever.
  2779	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2780	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2781	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2782	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2783	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER IX
  2784	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2785	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAT half-past nine, that night, Tom and Sid were sent to bed, as usual.
  2786	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThey said their prayers, and Sid was soon asleep. Tom lay awake and
  2787	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twaited, in restless impatience. When it seemed to him that it must be
  2788	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnearly daylight, he heard the clock strike ten! This was despair. He
  2789	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twould have tossed and fidgeted, as his nerves demanded, but he was
  2790	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tafraid he might wake Sid. So he lay still, and stared up into the dark.
  2791	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tEverything was dismally still. By and by, out of the stillness, little,
  2792	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tscarcely perceptible noises began to emphasize themselves. The ticking
  2793	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof the clock began to bring itself into notice. Old beams began to crack
  2794	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmysteriously. The stairs creaked faintly. Evidently spirits were abroad.
  2795	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tA measured, muffled snore issued from Aunt Polly’s chamber. And now the
  2796	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttiresome chirping of a cricket that no human ingenuity could locate,
  2797	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbegan. Next the ghastly ticking of a death-watch in the wall at the
  2798	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbed’s head made Tom shudder--it meant that somebody’s days were numbered.
  2799	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThen the howl of a far-off dog rose on the night air, and was answered
  2800	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tby a fainter howl from a remoter distance. Tom was in an agony. At last
  2801	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\the was satisfied that time had ceased and eternity begun; he began to
  2802	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdoze, in spite of himself; the clock chimed eleven, but he did not hear
  2803	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tit. And then there came, mingling with his half-formed dreams, a most
  2804	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmelancholy caterwauling. The raising of a neighboring window disturbed
  2805	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thim. A cry of “Scat! you devil!” and the crash of an empty bottle
  2806	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tagainst the back of his aunt’s woodshed brought him wide awake, and a
  2807	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsingle minute later he was dressed and out of the window and creeping
  2808	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\talong the roof of the “ell” on all fours. He “meow’d” with caution once
  2809	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tor twice, as he went; then jumped to the roof of the woodshed and thence
  2810	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto the ground. Huckleberry Finn was there, with his dead cat. The boys
  2811	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmoved off and disappeared in the gloom. At the end of half an hour they
  2812	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twere wading through the tall grass of the graveyard.
  2813	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2814	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tIt was a graveyard of the old-fashioned Western kind. It was on a hill,
  2815	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tabout a mile and a half from the village. It had a crazy board fence
  2816	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\taround it, which leaned inward in places, and outward the rest of the
  2817	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttime, but stood upright nowhere. Grass and weeds grew rank over the
  2818	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhole cemetery. All the old graves were sunken in, there was not a
  2819	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttombstone on the place; round-topped, worm-eaten boards staggered over
  2820	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe graves, leaning for support and finding none. “Sacred to the memory
  2821	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof” So-and-So had been painted on them once, but it could no longer have
  2822	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbeen read, on the most of them, now, even if there had been light.
  2823	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2824	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tA faint wind moaned through the trees, and Tom feared it might be the
  2825	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tspirits of the dead, complaining at being disturbed. The boys talked
  2826	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlittle, and only under their breath, for the time and the place and the
  2827	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpervading solemnity and silence oppressed their spirits. They found the
  2828	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsharp new heap they were seeking, and ensconced themselves within the
  2829	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tprotection of three great elms that grew in a bunch within a few feet of
  2830	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe grave.
  2831	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2832	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThen they waited in silence for what seemed a long time. The hooting of
  2833	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta distant owl was all the sound that troubled the dead stillness. Tom’s
  2834	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\treflections grew oppressive. He must force some talk. So he said in a
  2835	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhisper:
  2836	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2837	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hucky, do you believe the dead people like it for us to be here?”
  2838	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2839	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHuckleberry whispered:
  2840	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2841	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I wisht I knowed. It’s awful solemn like, _ain’t_ it?”
  2842	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2843	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I bet it is.”
  2844	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2845	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThere was a considerable pause, while the boys canvassed this matter
  2846	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tinwardly. Then Tom whispered:
  2847	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2848	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Say, Hucky--do you reckon Hoss Williams hears us talking?”
  2849	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2850	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“O’ course he does. Least his sperrit does.”
  2851	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2852	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom, after a pause:
  2853	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2854	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I wish I’d said Mister Williams. But I never meant any harm. Everybody
  2855	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcalls him Hoss.”
  2856	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2857	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“A body can’t be too partic’lar how they talk ‘bout these-yer dead
  2858	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpeople, Tom.”
  2859	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2860	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThis was a damper, and conversation died again.
  2861	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2862	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tPresently Tom seized his comrade’s arm and said:
  2863	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2864	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Sh!”
  2865	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2866	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“What is it, Tom?” And the two clung together with beating hearts.
  2867	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2868	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Sh! There ‘tis again! Didn’t you hear it?”
  2869	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2870	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I--”
  2871	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2872	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“There! Now you hear it.”
  2873	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2874	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Lord, Tom, they’re coming! They’re coming, sure. What’ll we do?”
  2875	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2876	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I dono. Think they’ll see us?”
  2877	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2878	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, Tom, they can see in the dark, same as cats. I wisht I hadn’t
  2879	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcome.”
  2880	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2881	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, don’t be afeard. I don’t believe they’ll bother us. We ain’t doing
  2882	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tany harm. If we keep perfectly still, maybe they won’t notice us at
  2883	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tall.”
  2884	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2885	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’ll try to, Tom, but, Lord, I’m all of a shiver.”
  2886	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2887	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Listen!”
  2888	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2889	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe boys bent their heads together and scarcely breathed. A muffled
  2890	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsound of voices floated up from the far end of the graveyard.
  2891	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2892	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Look! See there!” whispered Tom. “What is it?”
  2893	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2894	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s devil-fire. Oh, Tom, this is awful.”
  2895	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2896	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tSome vague figures approached through the gloom, swinging an
  2897	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\told-fashioned tin lantern that freckled the ground with innumerable
  2898	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlittle spangles of light. Presently Huckleberry whispered with a
  2899	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tshudder:
  2900	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2901	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s the devils sure enough. Three of ‘em! Lordy, Tom, we’re goners!
  2902	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tCan you pray?”
  2903	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2904	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’ll try, but don’t you be afeard. They ain’t going to hurt us. ‘Now I
  2905	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlay me down to sleep, I--’”
  2906	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2907	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Sh!”
  2908	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2909	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“What is it, Huck?”

  2911	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“They’re _humans_! One of ‘em is, anyway. One of ‘em’s old Muff Potter’s
  2912	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tvoice.”
  2913	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2914	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No--‘tain’t so, is it?”
  2915	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2916	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I bet I know it. Don’t you stir nor budge. He ain’t sharp enough to
  2917	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnotice us. Drunk, the same as usual, likely--blamed old rip!”
  2918	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2919	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right, I’ll keep still. Now they’re stuck. Can’t find it. Here they
  2920	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcome again. Now they’re hot. Cold again. Hot again. Red hot! They’re
  2921	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tp’inted right, this time. Say, Huck, I know another o’ them voices; it’s
  2922	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tInjun Joe.”
  2923	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2924	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“That’s so--that murderin’ half-breed! I’d druther they was devils a dern
  2925	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsight. What kin they be up to?”
  2926	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2927	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe whisper died wholly out, now, for the three men had reached the
  2928	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgrave and stood within a few feet of the boys’ hiding-place.
  2929	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2930	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Here it is,” said the third voice; and the owner of it held the lantern
  2931	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tup and revealed the face of young Doctor Robinson.
  2932	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2933	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tPotter and Injun Joe were carrying a handbarrow with a rope and a couple
  2934	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof shovels on it. They cast down their load and began to open the grave.
  2935	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe doctor put the lantern at the head of the grave and came and sat
  2936	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdown with his back against one of the elm trees. He was so close the
  2937	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tboys could have touched him.
  2938	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2939	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hurry, men!” he said, in a low voice; “the moon might come out at any
  2940	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmoment.”
  2941	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2942	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThey growled a response and went on digging. For some time there was no
  2943	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnoise but the grating sound of the spades discharging their freight of
  2944	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmould and gravel. It was very monotonous. Finally a spade struck upon
  2945	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe coffin with a dull woody accent, and within another minute or two
  2946	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe men had hoisted it out on the ground. They pried off the lid with
  2947	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttheir shovels, got out the body and dumped it rudely on the ground. The
  2948	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmoon drifted from behind the clouds and exposed the pallid face.
  2949	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe barrow was got ready and the corpse placed on it, covered with a
  2950	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tblanket, and bound to its place with the rope. Potter took out a large
  2951	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tspring-knife and cut off the dangling end of the rope and then said:
  2952	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2953	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now the cussed thing’s ready, Sawbones, and you’ll just out with
  2954	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tanother five, or here she stays.”
  2955	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2956	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“That’s the talk!” said Injun Joe.
  2957	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2958	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Look here, what does this mean?” said the doctor. “You required your
  2959	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpay in advance, and I’ve paid you.”
  2960	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2961	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, and you done more than that,” said Injun Joe, approaching the
  2962	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdoctor, who was now standing. “Five years ago you drove me away from
  2963	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tyour father’s kitchen one night, when I come to ask for something to
  2964	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\teat, and you said I warn’t there for any good; and when I swore I’d get
  2965	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\teven with you if it took a hundred years, your father had me jailed for
  2966	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta vagrant. Did you think I’d forget? The Injun blood ain’t in me for
  2967	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnothing. And now I’ve _got_ you, and you got to _settle_, you know!”
  2968	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2969	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHe was threatening the doctor, with his fist in his face, by this time.
  2970	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe doctor struck out suddenly and stretched the ruffian on the ground.
  2971	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tPotter dropped his knife, and exclaimed:
  2972	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2973	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Here, now, don’t you hit my pard!” and the next moment he had grappled
  2974	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twith the doctor and the two were struggling with might and main,
  2975	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttrampling the grass and tearing the ground with their heels. Injun Joe
  2976	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsprang to his feet, his eyes flaming with passion, snatched up Potter’s
  2977	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tknife, and went creeping, catlike and stooping, round and round about
  2978	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe combatants, seeking an opportunity. All at once the doctor flung
  2979	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thimself free, seized the heavy headboard of Williams’ grave and felled
  2980	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tPotter to the earth with it--and in the same instant the half-breed saw
  2981	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\this chance and drove the knife to the hilt in the young man’s breast. He
  2982	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\treeled and fell partly upon Potter, flooding him with his blood, and in
  2983	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe same moment the clouds blotted out the dreadful spectacle and the
  2984	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttwo frightened boys went speeding away in the dark.
  2985	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2986	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tPresently, when the moon emerged again, Injun Joe was standing over the
  2987	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttwo forms, contemplating them. The doctor murmured inarticulately, gave
  2988	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta long gasp or two and was still. The half-breed muttered:
  2989	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2990	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“_That_ score is settled--damn you.”
  2991	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2992	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThen he robbed the body. After which he put the fatal knife in Potter’s
  2993	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\topen right hand, and sat down on the dismantled coffin. Three--four--five
  2994	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tminutes passed, and then Potter began to stir and moan. His hand closed
  2995	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tupon the knife; he raised it, glanced at it, and let it fall, with a
  2996	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tshudder. Then he sat up, pushing the body from him, and gazed at it, and
  2997	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthen around him, confusedly. His eyes met Joe’s.
  2998	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  2999	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Lord, how is this, Joe?” he said.
  3000	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3001	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s a dirty business,” said Joe, without moving.
  3002	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3003	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“What did you do it for?”
  3004	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3005	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I! I never done it!”
  3006	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3007	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Look here! That kind of talk won’t wash.”
  3008	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3009	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tPotter trembled and grew white.
  3010	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3011	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I thought I’d got sober. I’d no business to drink to-night. But it’s
  3012	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin my head yet--worse’n when we started here. I’m all in a muddle;
  3013	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcan’t recollect anything of it, hardly. Tell me, Joe--_honest_, now,
  3014	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\told feller--did I do it? Joe, I never meant to--‘pon my soul and honor, I
  3015	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnever meant to, Joe. Tell me how it was, Joe. Oh, it’s awful--and him so
  3016	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tyoung and promising.”
  3017	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3018	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, you two was scuffling, and he fetched you one with the headboard
  3019	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand you fell flat; and then up you come, all reeling and staggering
  3020	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlike, and snatched the knife and jammed it into him, just as he fetched
  3021	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tyou another awful clip--and here you’ve laid, as dead as a wedge til
  3022	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnow.”
  3023	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3024	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, I didn’t know what I was a-doing. I wish I may die this minute if I
  3025	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdid. It was all on account of the whiskey and the excitement, I reckon.
  3026	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tI never used a weepon in my life before, Joe. I’ve fought, but never
  3027	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twith weepons. They’ll all say that. Joe, don’t tell! Say you won’t tell,
  3028	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tJoe--that’s a good feller. I always liked you, Joe, and stood up for you,
  3029	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttoo. Don’t you remember? You _won’t_ tell, _will_ you, Joe?” And the
  3030	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpoor creature dropped on his knees before the stolid murderer, and
  3031	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tclasped his appealing hands.
  3032	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3033	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, you’ve always been fair and square with me, Muff Potter, and I
  3034	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twon’t go back on you. There, now, that’s as fair as a man can say.”
  3035	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3036	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, Joe, you’re an angel. I’ll bless you for this the longest day I
  3037	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlive.” And Potter began to cry.
  3038	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3039	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Come, now, that’s enough of that. This ain’t any time for blubbering.
  3040	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tYou be off yonder way and I’ll go this. Move, now, and don’t leave any
  3041	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttracks behind you.”
  3042	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3043	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tPotter started on a trot that quickly increased to a run. The half-breed
  3044	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstood looking after him. He muttered:
  3045	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3046	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“If he’s as much stunned with the lick and fuddled with the rum as he
  3047	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thad the look of being, he won’t think of the knife till he’s gone so
  3048	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfar he’ll be afraid to come back after it to such a place by
  3049	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thimself--chicken-heart!”
  3050	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3051	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTwo or three minutes later the murdered man, the blanketed corpse, the
  3052	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlidless coffin, and the open grave were under no inspection but the
  3053	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmoon’s. The stillness was complete again, too.
  3054	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3055	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3056	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3057	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3058	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER X
  3059	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3060	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTHE two boys flew on and on, toward the village, speechless with
  3061	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thorror. They glanced backward over their shoulders from time to time,
  3062	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tapprehensively, as if they feared they might be followed. Every stump
  3063	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat started up in their path seemed a man and an enemy, and made them
  3064	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcatch their breath; and as they sped by some outlying cottages that lay
  3065	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnear the village, the barking of the aroused watch-dogs seemed to give
  3066	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twings to their feet.
  3067	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3068	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“If we can only get to the old tannery before we break down!” whispered
  3069	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom, in short catches between breaths. “I can’t stand it much longer.”
  3070	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3071	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHuckleberry’s hard pantings were his only reply, and the boys fixed
  3072	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttheir eyes on the goal of their hopes and bent to their work to win it.
  3073	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThey gained steadily on it, and at last, breast to breast, they burst
  3074	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthrough the open door and fell grateful and exhausted in the sheltering
  3075	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tshadows beyond. By and by their pulses slowed down, and Tom whispered:
  3076	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3077	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Huckleberry, what do you reckon’ll come of this?”
  3078	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3079	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“If Doctor Robinson dies, I reckon hanging’ll come of it.”
  3080	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3081	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Do you though?”
  3082	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3083	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, I _know_ it, Tom.”
  3084	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3085	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom thought a while, then he said:
  3086	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3087	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Who’ll tell? We?”
  3088	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3089	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“What are you talking about? S’pose something happened and Injun Joe
  3090	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t_didn’t_ hang? Why, he’d kill us some time or other, just as dead sure
  3091	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tas we’re a laying here.”
  3092	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3093	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“That’s just what I was thinking to myself, Huck.”
  3094	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3095	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“If anybody tells, let Muff Potter do it, if he’s fool enough. He’s
  3096	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgenerally drunk enough.”
  3097	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3098	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom said nothing--went on thinking. Presently he whispered:
  3099	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3100	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Huck, Muff Potter don’t know it. How can he tell?”
  3101	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3102	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“What’s the reason he don’t know it?”
  3103	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3104	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Because he’d just got that whack when Injun Joe done it. D’you reckon
  3105	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\the could see anything? D’you reckon he knowed anything?”
  3106	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3107	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“By hokey, that’s so, Tom!”
  3108	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3109	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“And besides, look-a-here--maybe that whack done for _him_!”
  3110	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3111	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, ‘taint likely, Tom. He had liquor in him; I could see that; and
  3112	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbesides, he always has. Well, when pap’s full, you might take and belt
  3113	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thim over the head with a church and you couldn’t phase him. He says so,
  3114	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\this own self. So it’s the same with Muff Potter, of course. But if a man
  3115	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas dead sober, I reckon maybe that whack might fetch him; I dono.”
  3116	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3117	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAfter another reflective silence, Tom said:
  3118	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3119	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hucky, you sure you can keep mum?”
  3120	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3121	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tom, we _got_ to keep mum. You know that. That Injun devil wouldn’t
  3122	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmake any more of drownding us than a couple of cats, if we was to squeak
  3123	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t‘bout this and they didn’t hang him. Now, look-a-here, Tom, less take
  3124	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand swear to one another--that’s what we got to do--swear to keep mum.”
  3125	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3126	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’m agreed. It’s the best thing. Would you just hold hands and swear
  3127	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat we--”
  3128	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3129	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh no, that wouldn’t do for this. That’s good enough for little
  3130	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\trubbishy common things--specially with gals, cuz _they_ go back on you
  3131	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tanyway, and blab if they get in a huff--but there orter be writing ‘bout
  3132	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta big thing like this. And blood.”
  3133	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3134	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom’s whole being applauded this idea. It was deep, and dark, and awful;
  3135	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe hour, the circumstances, the surroundings, were in keeping with it.
  3136	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHe picked up a clean pine shingle that lay in the moon-light, took a
  3137	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlittle fragment of “red keel” out of his pocket, got the moon on
  3138	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\this work, and painfully scrawled these lines, emphasizing each slow
  3139	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdown-stroke by clamping his tongue between his teeth, and letting up the
  3140	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpressure on the up-strokes. [See next page.]

  3144	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3145	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHuckleberry was filled with admiration of Tom’s facility in writing, and
  3146	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe sublimity of his language. He at once took a pin from his lapel and
  3147	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas going to prick his flesh, but Tom said:
  3148	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3149	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hold on! Don’t do that. A pin’s brass. It might have verdigrease on
  3150	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tit.”
  3151	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3152	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“What’s verdigrease?”
  3153	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3154	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s p’ison. That’s what it is. You just swaller some of it once--you’ll
  3155	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsee.”
  3156	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3157	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tSo Tom unwound the thread from one of his needles, and each boy pricked
  3158	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe ball of his thumb and squeezed out a drop of blood. In time, after
  3159	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmany squeezes, Tom managed to sign his initials, using the ball of his
  3160	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlittle finger for a pen. Then he showed Huckleberry how to make an H and
  3161	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tan F, and the oath was complete. They buried the shingle close to the
  3162	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twall, with some dismal ceremonies and incantations, and the fetters
  3163	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat bound their tongues were considered to be locked and the key thrown
  3164	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\taway.
  3165	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3166	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tA figure crept stealthily through a break in the other end of the ruined
  3167	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbuilding, now, but they did not notice it.
  3168	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3169	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tom,” whispered Huckleberry, “does this keep us from _ever_
  3170	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttelling--_always_?”
  3171	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3172	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Of course it does. It don’t make any difference _what_ happens, we got
  3173	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto keep mum. We’d drop down dead--don’t _you_ know that?”
  3174	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3175	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, I reckon that’s so.”
  3176	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3177	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThey continued to whisper for some little time. Presently a dog set up
  3178	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta long, lugubrious howl just outside--within ten feet of them. The boys
  3179	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tclasped each other suddenly, in an agony of fright.
  3180	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3181	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Which of us does he mean?” gasped Huckleberry.
  3182	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3183	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I dono--peep through the crack. Quick!”
  3184	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3185	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, _you_, Tom!”
  3186	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3187	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I can’t--I can’t _do_ it, Huck!”
  3188	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3189	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Please, Tom. There ‘tis again!”
  3190	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3191	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, lordy, I’m thankful!” whispered Tom. “I know his voice. It’s Bull
  3192	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHarbison.” *
  3193	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3194	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t[* If Mr. Harbison owned a slave named Bull, Tom would have spoken of
  3195	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thim as “Harbison’s Bull,” but a son or a dog of that name was “Bull
  3196	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHarbison.”]
  3197	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3198	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, that’s good--I tell you, Tom, I was most scared to death; I’d a bet
  3199	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tanything it was a _stray_ dog.”
  3200	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3201	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe dog howled again. The boys’ hearts sank once more.
  3202	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3203	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, my! that ain’t no Bull Harbison!” whispered Huckleberry. “_Do_,
  3204	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom!”
  3205	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3206	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom, quaking with fear, yielded, and put his eye to the crack. His
  3207	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhisper was hardly audible when he said:
  3208	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3209	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, Huck, _its a stray dog_!”
  3210	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3211	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Quick, Tom, quick! Who does he mean?”
  3212	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3213	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Huck, he must mean us both--we’re right together.”
  3214	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3215	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, Tom, I reckon we’re goners. I reckon there ain’t no mistake ‘bout
  3216	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhere _I’ll_ go to. I been so wicked.”
  3217	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3218	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Dad fetch it! This comes of playing hookey and doing everything a
  3219	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfeller’s told _not_ to do. I might a been good, like Sid, if I’d a
  3220	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttried--but no, I wouldn’t, of course. But if ever I get off this time,
  3221	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tI lay I’ll just _waller_ in Sunday-schools!” And Tom began to snuffle a
  3222	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlittle.
  3223	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3224	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“_You_ bad!” and Huckleberry began to snuffle too. “Consound it, Tom
  3225	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tSawyer, you’re just old pie, ‘long-side o’ what I am. Oh, _lordy_,
  3226	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlordy, lordy, I wisht I only had half your chance.”
  3227	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3228	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom choked off and whispered:
  3229	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3230	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Look, Hucky, look! He’s got his _back_ to us!”
  3231	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3232	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHucky looked, with joy in his heart.
  3233	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3234	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, he has, by jingoes! Did he before?”
  3235	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3236	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, he did. But I, like a fool, never thought. Oh, this is bully, you
  3237	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tknow. _Now_ who can he mean?”
  3238	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3239	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe howling stopped. Tom pricked up his ears.
  3240	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3241	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Sh! What’s that?” he whispered.
  3242	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3243	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Sounds like--like hogs grunting. No--it’s somebody snoring, Tom.”
  3244	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3245	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“That _is_ it! Where ‘bouts is it, Huck?”
  3246	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3247	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I bleeve it’s down at ‘tother end. Sounds so, anyway. Pap used to sleep
  3248	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthere, sometimes, ‘long with the hogs, but laws bless you, he just lifts
  3249	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthings when _he_ snores. Besides, I reckon he ain’t ever coming back to
  3250	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthis town any more.”
  3251	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3252	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe spirit of adventure rose in the boys’ souls once more.
  3253	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3254	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hucky, do you das’t to go if I lead?”
  3255	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3256	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I don’t like to, much. Tom, s’pose it’s Injun Joe!”
  3257	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3258	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom quailed. But presently the temptation rose up strong again and the
  3259	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tboys agreed to try, with the understanding that they would take to their
  3260	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\theels if the snoring stopped. So they went tiptoeing stealthily down,
  3261	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe one behind the other. When they had got to within five steps of the
  3262	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsnorer, Tom stepped on a stick, and it broke with a sharp snap. The man
  3263	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmoaned, writhed a little, and his face came into the moonlight. It was
  3264	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tMuff Potter. The boys’ hearts had stood still, and their hopes too,
  3265	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhen the man moved, but their fears passed away now. They tip-toed out,
  3266	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthrough the broken weather-boarding, and stopped at a little distance
  3267	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto exchange a parting word. That long, lugubrious howl rose on the night
  3268	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tair again! They turned and saw the strange dog standing within a few
  3269	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfeet of where Potter was lying, and _facing_ Potter, with his nose
  3270	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpointing heavenward.
  3271	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3272	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, geeminy, it’s _him_!” exclaimed both boys, in a breath.
  3273	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3274	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Say, Tom--they say a stray dog come howling around Johnny Miller’s
  3275	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thouse, ‘bout midnight, as much as two weeks ago; and a whippoorwill come
  3276	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin and lit on the banisters and sung, the very same evening; and there
  3277	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tain’t anybody dead there yet.”
  3278	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3279	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I know that. And suppose there ain’t. Didn’t Gracie Miller fall
  3280	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin the kitchen fire and burn herself terrible the very next Saturday?”
  3281	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3282	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, but she ain’t _dead_. And what’s more, she’s getting better, too.”
  3283	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3284	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right, you wait and see. She’s a goner, just as dead sure as Muff
  3285	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tPotter’s a goner. That’s what the niggers say, and they know all about
  3286	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthese kind of things, Huck.”
  3287	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3288	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThen they separated, cogitating. When Tom crept in at his bedroom window
  3289	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe night was almost spent. He undressed with excessive caution, and
  3290	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfell asleep congratulating himself that nobody knew of his escapade. He
  3291	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas not aware that the gently-snoring Sid was awake, and had been so for
  3292	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tan hour.
  3293	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3294	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen Tom awoke, Sid was dressed and gone. There was a late look in the
  3295	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlight, a late sense in the atmosphere. He was startled. Why had he not
  3296	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbeen called--persecuted till he was up, as usual? The thought filled
  3297	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thim with bodings. Within five minutes he was dressed and down-stairs,
  3298	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfeeling sore and drowsy. The family were still at table, but they had
  3299	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfinished breakfast. There was no voice of rebuke; but there were averted
  3300	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\teyes; there was a silence and an air of solemnity that struck a chill
  3301	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto the culprit’s heart. He sat down and tried to seem gay, but it
  3302	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas up-hill work; it roused no smile, no response, and he lapsed into
  3303	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsilence and let his heart sink down to the depths.
  3304	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3305	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAfter breakfast his aunt took him aside, and Tom almost brightened in
  3306	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe hope that he was going to be flogged; but it was not so. His aunt
  3307	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twept over him and asked him how he could go and break her old heart so;
  3308	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand finally told him to go on, and ruin himself and bring her gray hairs
  3309	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twith sorrow to the grave, for it was no use for her to try any more.
  3310	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThis was worse than a thousand whippings, and Tom’s heart was sorer now
  3311	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthan his body. He cried, he pleaded for forgiveness, promised to reform
  3312	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tover and over again, and then received his dismissal, feeling that
  3313	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\the had won but an imperfect forgiveness and established but a feeble
  3314	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tconfidence.
  3315	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3316	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHe left the presence too miserable to even feel revengeful toward
  3317	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tSid; and so the latter’s prompt retreat through the back gate was
  3318	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tunnecessary. He moped to school gloomy and sad, and took his flogging,
  3319	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\talong with Joe Harper, for playing hookey the day before, with the
  3320	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tair of one whose heart was busy with heavier woes and wholly dead to
  3321	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttrifles. Then he betook himself to his seat, rested his elbows on his
  3322	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdesk and his jaws in his hands, and stared at the wall with the stony
  3323	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstare of suffering that has reached the limit and can no further go.
  3324	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHis elbow was pressing against some hard substance. After a long time
  3325	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\the slowly and sadly changed his position, and took up this object with
  3326	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta sigh. It was in a paper. He unrolled it. A long, lingering, colossal
  3327	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsigh followed, and his heart broke. It was his brass andiron knob!
  3328	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3329	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThis final feather broke the camel’s back.
  3330	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3331	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3332	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3333	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3334	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XI
  3335	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3336	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tCLOSE upon the hour of noon the whole village was suddenly electrified
  3337	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twith the ghastly news. No need of the as yet un-dreamed-of telegraph;
  3338	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe tale flew from man to man, from group to group, from house to house,
  3339	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twith little less than telegraphic speed. Of course the schoolmaster gave
  3340	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tholi-day for that afternoon; the town would have thought strangely of
  3341	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thim if he had not.
  3342	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3343	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tA gory knife had been found close to the murdered man, and it had been
  3344	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\trecognized by somebody as belonging to Muff Potter--so the story ran. And
  3345	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tit was said that a belated citizen had come upon Potter washing himself
  3346	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin the “branch” about one or two o’clock in the morning, and that Potter
  3347	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thad at once sneaked off--suspicious circumstances, especially the washing
  3348	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhich was not a habit with Potter. It was also said that the town had
  3349	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbeen ransacked for this “murderer” (the public are not slow in the
  3350	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmatter of sifting evidence and arriving at a verdict), but that he
  3351	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcould not be found. Horsemen had departed down all the roads in every
  3352	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdirection, and the Sheriff “was confident” that he would be captured
  3353	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore night.
  3354	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3355	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAll the town was drifting toward the graveyard. Tom’s heartbreak
  3356	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tvanished and he joined the procession, not because he would not
  3357	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta thousand times rather go anywhere else, but because an awful,
  3358	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tunaccountable fascination drew him on. Arrived at the dreadful place, he
  3359	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twormed his small body through the crowd and saw the dismal spectacle.
  3360	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tIt seemed to him an age since he was there before. Somebody pinched
  3361	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\this arm. He turned, and his eyes met Huckleberry’s. Then both looked
  3362	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\telsewhere at once, and wondered if anybody had noticed anything in their
  3363	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmutual glance. But everybody was talking, and intent upon the grisly
  3364	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tspectacle before them.
  3365	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3366	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Poor fellow!” “Poor young fellow!” “This ought to be a lesson to grave
  3367	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\trobbers!” “Muff Potter’ll hang for this if they catch him!” This was the
  3368	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdrift of remark; and the minister said, “It was a judgment; His hand is
  3369	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\there.”
  3370	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3371	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tNow Tom shivered from head to heel; for his eye fell upon the stolid
  3372	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tface of Injun Joe. At this moment the crowd began to sway and struggle,
  3373	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand voices shouted, “It’s him! it’s him! he’s coming himself!”
  3374	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3375	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Who? Who?” from twenty voices.
  3376	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3377	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Muff Potter!”
  3378	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3379	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hallo, he’s stopped!--Look out, he’s turning! Don’t let him get away!”
  3380	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3381	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tPeople in the branches of the trees over Tom’s head said he wasn’t
  3382	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttrying to get away--he only looked doubtful and perplexed.
  3383	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3384	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Infernal impudence!” said a bystander; “wanted to come and take a quiet
  3385	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlook at his work, I reckon--didn’t expect any company.”
  3386	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3387	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe crowd fell apart, now, and the Sheriff came through, ostentatiously
  3388	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tleading Potter by the arm. The poor fellow’s face was haggard, and
  3389	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\this eyes showed the fear that was upon him. When he stood before the
  3390	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmurdered man, he shook as with a palsy, and he put his face in his hands
  3391	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand burst into tears.
  3392	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3393	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I didn’t do it, friends,” he sobbed; “‘pon my word and honor I never
  3394	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdone it.”
  3395	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3396	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Who’s accused you?” shouted a voice.
  3397	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3398	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThis shot seemed to carry home. Potter lifted his face and looked around
  3399	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thim with a pathetic hopelessness in his eyes. He saw Injun Joe, and
  3400	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\texclaimed:
  3401	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3402	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, Injun Joe, you promised me you’d never--”
  3403	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3404	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Is that your knife?” and it was thrust before him by the Sheriff.
  3405	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3406	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tPotter would have fallen if they had not caught him and eased him to the
  3407	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tground. Then he said:
  3408	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3409	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Something told me ‘t if I didn’t come back and get--” He shuddered; then
  3410	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twaved his nerveless hand with a vanquished gesture and said, “Tell ‘em,
  3411	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tJoe, tell ‘em--it ain’t any use any more.”
  3412	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3413	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThen Huckleberry and Tom stood dumb and staring, and heard the
  3414	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstony-hearted liar reel off his serene statement, they expecting every
  3415	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmoment that the clear sky would deliver God’s lightnings upon his head,
  3416	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand wondering to see how long the stroke was delayed. And when he had
  3417	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfinished and still stood alive and whole, their wavering impulse to
  3418	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbreak their oath and save the poor betrayed prisoner’s life faded and
  3419	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tvanished away, for plainly this miscreant had sold himself to Satan and
  3420	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tit would be fatal to meddle with the property of such a power as that.
  3421	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3422	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why didn’t you leave? What did you want to come here for?” somebody
  3423	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid.
  3424	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3425	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I couldn’t help it--I couldn’t help it,” Potter moaned. “I wanted to
  3426	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\trun away, but I couldn’t seem to come anywhere but here.” And he fell to
  3427	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsobbing again.
  3428	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3429	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tInjun Joe repeated his statement, just as calmly, a few minutes
  3430	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tafterward on the inquest, under oath; and the boys, seeing that the
  3431	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlightnings were still withheld, were confirmed in their belief that
  3432	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tJoe had sold himself to the devil. He was now become, to them, the most
  3433	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbalefully interesting object they had ever looked upon, and they could
  3434	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnot take their fascinated eyes from his face.
  3435	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3436	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThey inwardly resolved to watch him nights, when opportunity should
  3437	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\toffer, in the hope of getting a glimpse of his dread master.
  3438	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3439	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tInjun Joe helped to raise the body of the murdered man and put it in
  3440	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta wagon for removal; and it was whispered through the shuddering
  3441	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcrowd that the wound bled a little! The boys thought that this happy
  3442	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcircumstance would turn suspicion in the right direction; but they were
  3443	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdisappointed, for more than one villager remarked:
  3444	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3445	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“It was within three feet of Muff Potter when it done it.”
  3446	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3447	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom’s fearful secret and gnawing conscience disturbed his sleep for as
  3448	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmuch as a week after this; and at breakfast one morning Sid said:
  3449	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3450	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tom, you pitch around and talk in your sleep so much that you keep me
  3451	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tawake half the time.”
  3452	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3453	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom blanched and dropped his eyes.
  3454	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3455	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s a bad sign,” said Aunt Polly, gravely. “What you got on your mind,
  3456	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom?”
  3457	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3458	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Nothing. Nothing ‘t I know of.” But the boy’s hand shook so that he
  3459	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tspilled his coffee.
  3460	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3461	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“And you do talk such stuff,” Sid said. “Last night you said, ‘It’s
  3462	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tblood, it’s blood, that’s what it is!’ You said that over and over.
  3463	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd you said, ‘Don’t torment me so--I’ll tell!’ Tell _what_? What is it
  3464	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tyou’ll tell?”
  3465	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3466	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tEverything was swimming before Tom. There is no telling what might have
  3467	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thappened, now, but luckily the concern passed out of Aunt Polly’s face
  3468	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand she came to Tom’s relief without knowing it. She said:
  3469	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3470	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Sho! It’s that dreadful murder. I dream about it most every night
  3471	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmyself. Sometimes I dream it’s me that done it.”
  3472	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3473	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tMary said she had been affected much the same way. Sid seemed satisfied.
  3474	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom got out of the presence as quick as he plausibly could, and after
  3475	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat he complained of toothache for a week, and tied up his jaws every
  3476	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnight. He never knew that Sid lay nightly watching, and frequently
  3477	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tslipped the bandage free and then leaned on his elbow listening a good
  3478	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhile at a time, and afterward slipped the bandage back to its place
  3479	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tagain. Tom’s distress of mind wore off gradually and the toothache grew
  3480	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tirksome and was discarded. If Sid really managed to make anything out of
  3481	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom’s disjointed mutterings, he kept it to himself.
  3482	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3483	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tIt seemed to Tom that his schoolmates never would get done holding
  3484	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tinquests on dead cats, and thus keeping his trouble present to his mind.
  3485	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tSid noticed that Tom never was coroner at one of these inquiries,
  3486	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthough it had been his habit to take the lead in all new enterprises;
  3487	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\the noticed, too, that Tom never acted as a witness--and that was strange;
  3488	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand Sid did not overlook the fact that Tom even showed a marked aversion
  3489	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto these inquests, and always avoided them when he could. Sid marvelled,
  3490	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbut said nothing. However, even inquests went out of vogue at last, and
  3491	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tceased to torture Tom’s conscience.
  3492	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3493	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tEvery day or two, during this time of sorrow, Tom watched his
  3494	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\topportunity and went to the little grated jail-window and smuggled such
  3495	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsmall comforts through to the “murderer” as he could get hold of. The
  3496	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tjail was a trifling little brick den that stood in a marsh at the edge
  3497	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof the village, and no guards were afforded for it; indeed, it
  3498	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas seldom occupied. These offerings greatly helped to ease Tom’s
  3499	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tconscience.
  3500	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3501	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe villagers had a strong desire to tar-and-feather Injun Joe and ride
  3502	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thim on a rail, for body-snatching, but so formidable was his character
  3503	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat nobody could be found who was willing to take the lead in the
  3504	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmatter, so it was dropped. He had been careful to begin both of his
  3505	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tinquest-statements with the fight, without confessing the grave-robbery
  3506	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat preceded it; therefore it was deemed wisest not to try the case in
  3507	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe courts at present.
  3508	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3509	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3510	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3511	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3512	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XII
  3513	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3514	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tONE of the reasons why Tom’s mind had drifted away from its secret
  3515	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttroubles was, that it had found a new and weighty matter to interest
  3516	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\titself about. Becky Thatcher had stopped coming to school. Tom had
  3517	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstruggled with his pride a few days, and tried to “whistle her down the
  3518	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twind,” but failed. He began to find himself hanging around her father’s
  3519	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thouse, nights, and feeling very miserable. She was ill. What if she
  3520	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tshould die! There was distraction in the thought. He no longer took an
  3521	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tinterest in war, nor even in piracy. The charm of life was gone; there
  3522	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas nothing but dreariness left. He put his hoop away, and his bat;
  3523	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthere was no joy in them any more. His aunt was concerned. She began to
  3524	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttry all manner of remedies on him. She was one of those people who
  3525	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tare infatuated with patent medicines and all new-fangled methods of
  3526	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tproducing health or mending it. She was an inveterate experimenter in
  3527	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthese things. When something fresh in this line came out she was in a
  3528	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfever, right away, to try it; not on herself, for she was never ailing,
  3529	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbut on anybody else that came handy. She was a subscriber for all the
  3530	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Health” periodicals and phrenological frauds; and the solemn ignorance
  3531	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthey were inflated with was breath to her nostrils. All the “rot” they
  3532	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcontained about ventilation, and how to go to bed, and how to get up,
  3533	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand what to eat, and what to drink, and how much exercise to take, and
  3534	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhat frame of mind to keep one’s self in, and what sort of clothing
  3535	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto wear, was all gospel to her, and she never observed that her
  3536	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thealth-journals of the current month customarily upset everything they
  3537	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thad recommended the month before. She was as simple-hearted and honest
  3538	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tas the day was long, and so she was an easy victim. She gathered
  3539	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttogether her quack periodicals and her quack medicines, and thus armed
  3540	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twith death, went about on her pale horse, metaphorically speaking, with
  3541	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“hell following after.” But she never suspected that she was not an
  3542	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tangel of healing and the balm of Gilead in disguise, to the suffering
  3543	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tneighbors.
  3544	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3545	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe water treatment was new, now, and Tom’s low condition was a windfall
  3546	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto her. She had him out at daylight every morning, stood him up in the
  3547	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twood-shed and drowned him with a deluge of cold water; then she scrubbed
  3548	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thim down with a towel like a file, and so brought him to; then she
  3549	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\trolled him up in a wet sheet and put him away under blankets till she
  3550	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsweated his soul clean and “the yellow stains of it came through his
  3551	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpores”--as Tom said.
  3552	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3553	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tYet notwithstanding all this, the boy grew more and more melancholy and
  3554	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpale and dejected. She added hot baths, sitz baths, shower baths, and
  3555	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tplunges. The boy remained as dismal as a hearse. She began to assist the
  3556	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twater with a slim oatmeal diet and blister-plasters. She calculated his
  3557	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcapacity as she would a jug’s, and filled him up every day with quack
  3558	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcure-alls.
  3559	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3560	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom had become indifferent to persecution by this time. This phase
  3561	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfilled the old lady’s heart with consternation. This indifference must
  3562	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbe broken up at any cost. Now she heard of Pain-killer for the first
  3563	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttime. She ordered a lot at once. She tasted it and was filled with
  3564	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgratitude. It was simply fire in a liquid form. She dropped the water
  3565	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttreatment and everything else, and pinned her faith to Pain-killer.
  3566	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tShe gave Tom a teaspoonful and watched with the deepest anxiety for the
  3567	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tresult. Her troubles were instantly at rest, her soul at peace again;
  3568	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfor the “indifference” was broken up. The boy could not have shown a
  3569	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twilder, heartier interest, if she had built a fire under him.
  3570	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3571	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom felt that it was time to wake up; this sort of life might be
  3572	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tromantic enough, in his blighted condition, but it was getting to have
  3573	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttoo little sentiment and too much distracting variety about it. So he
  3574	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthought over various plans for relief, and finally hit upon that of
  3575	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tprofessing to be fond of Pain-killer. He asked for it so often that he
  3576	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbecame a nuisance, and his aunt ended by telling him to help himself and
  3577	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tquit bothering her. If it had been Sid, she would have had no misgivings
  3578	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto alloy her delight; but since it was Tom, she watched the bottle
  3579	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tclandestinely. She found that the medicine did really diminish, but it
  3580	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdid not occur to her that the boy was mending the health of a crack in
  3581	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe sitting-room floor with it.
  3582	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3583	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tOne day Tom was in the act of dosing the crack when his aunt’s yellow
  3584	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcat came along, purring, eyeing the teaspoon avariciously, and begging
  3585	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfor a taste. Tom said:
  3586	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3587	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Don’t ask for it unless you want it, Peter.”
  3588	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3589	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBut Peter signified that he did want it.
  3590	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3591	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“You better make sure.”
  3592	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3593	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tPeter was sure.
  3594	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3595	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now you’ve asked for it, and I’ll give it to you, because there ain’t
  3596	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tanything mean about me; but if you find you don’t like it, you mustn’t
  3597	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tblame anybody but your own self.”
  3598	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3599	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tPeter was agreeable. So Tom pried his mouth open and poured down
  3600	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe Pain-killer. Peter sprang a couple of yards in the air, and then
  3601	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdelivered a war-whoop and set off round and round the room, banging
  3602	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tagainst furniture, upsetting flower-pots, and making general havoc. Next
  3603	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\the rose on his hind feet and pranced around, in a frenzy of enjoyment,
  3604	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twith his head over his shoulder and his voice proclaiming his
  3605	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tunappeasable happiness. Then he went tearing around the house again
  3606	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tspreading chaos and destruction in his path. Aunt Polly entered in time
  3607	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto see him throw a few double summersets, deliver a final mighty hurrah,
  3608	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand sail through the open window, carrying the rest of the flower-pots
  3609	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twith him. The old lady stood petrified with astonishment, peering over
  3610	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ther glasses; Tom lay on the floor expiring with laughter.
  3611	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3612	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tom, what on earth ails that cat?”
  3613	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3614	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I don’t know, aunt,” gasped the boy.
  3615	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3616	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, I never see anything like it. What did make him act so?”
  3617	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3618	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Deed I don’t know, Aunt Polly; cats always act so when they’re having a
  3619	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgood time.”
  3620	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3621	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“They do, do they?” There was something in the tone that made Tom
  3622	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tapprehensive.
  3623	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3624	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes’m. That is, I believe they do.”
  3625	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3626	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“You _do_?”
  3627	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3628	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes’m.”
  3629	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3630	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe old lady was bending down, Tom watching, with interest emphasized
  3631	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tby anxiety. Too late he divined her “drift.” The handle of the telltale
  3632	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttea-spoon was visible under the bed-valance. Aunt Polly took it, held it
  3633	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tup. Tom winced, and dropped his eyes. Aunt Polly raised him by the usual
  3634	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thandle--his ear--and cracked his head soundly with her thimble.
  3635	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3636	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now, sir, what did you want to treat that poor dumb beast so, for?”
  3637	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3638	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I done it out of pity for him--because he hadn’t any aunt.”
  3639	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3640	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hadn’t any aunt!--you numskull. What has that got to do with it?”
  3641	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3642	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Heaps. Because if he’d had one she’d a burnt him out herself! She’d a
  3643	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\troasted his bowels out of him ‘thout any more feeling than if he was a
  3644	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thuman!”
  3645	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3646	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAunt Polly felt a sudden pang of remorse. This was putting the thing in
  3647	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta new light; what was cruelty to a cat _might_ be cruelty to a boy, too.
  3648	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tShe began to soften; she felt sorry. Her eyes watered a little, and she
  3649	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tput her hand on Tom’s head and said gently:
  3650	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3651	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I was meaning for the best, Tom. And, Tom, it _did_ do you good.”
  3652	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3653	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom looked up in her face with just a perceptible twinkle peeping
  3654	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthrough his gravity.
  3655	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3656	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I know you was meaning for the best, aunty, and so was I with Peter. It
  3657	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdone _him_ good, too. I never see him get around so since--”
  3658	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3659	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, go ‘long with you, Tom, before you aggravate me again. And you try
  3660	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand see if you can’t be a good boy, for once, and you needn’t take any
  3661	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmore medicine.”
  3662	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3663	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom reached school ahead of time. It was noticed that this strange thing
  3664	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thad been occurring every day latterly. And now, as usual of late,
  3665	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\the hung about the gate of the schoolyard instead of playing with his
  3666	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcomrades. He was sick, he said, and he looked it. He tried to seem to
  3667	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbe looking everywhere but whither he really was looking--down the road.
  3668	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tPresently Jeff Thatcher hove in sight, and Tom’s face lighted; he gazed
  3669	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta moment, and then turned sorrowfully away. When Jeff arrived, Tom
  3670	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\taccosted him; and “led up” warily to opportunities for remark about
  3671	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBecky, but the giddy lad never could see the bait. Tom watched and
  3672	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twatched, hoping whenever a frisking frock came in sight, and hating the
  3673	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\towner of it as soon as he saw she was not the right one. At last frocks
  3674	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tceased to appear, and he dropped hopelessly into the dumps; he entered
  3675	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe empty schoolhouse and sat down to suffer. Then one more frock passed
  3676	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin at the gate, and Tom’s heart gave a great bound. The next instant he
  3677	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas out, and “going on” like an Indian; yelling, laughing, chasing boys,
  3678	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tjumping over the fence at risk of life and limb, throwing handsprings,
  3679	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstanding on his head--doing all the heroic things he could conceive of,
  3680	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand keeping a furtive eye out, all the while, to see if Becky Thatcher
  3681	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas noticing. But she seemed to be unconscious of it all; she never
  3682	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlooked. Could it be possible that she was not aware that he was there?
  3683	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHe carried his exploits to her immediate vicinity; came war-whooping
  3684	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\taround, snatched a boy’s cap, hurled it to the roof of the schoolhouse,
  3685	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbroke through a group of boys, tumbling them in every direction, and
  3686	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfell sprawling, himself, under Becky’s nose, almost upsetting her--and
  3687	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tshe turned, with her nose in the air, and he heard her say: “Mf! some
  3688	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpeople think they’re mighty smart--always showing off!”
  3689	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3690	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom’s cheeks burned. He gathered himself up and sneaked off, crushed and
  3691	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcrestfallen.
  3692	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3693	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3694	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3695	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3696	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XIII
  3697	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3698	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTOM’S mind was made up now. He was gloomy and desperate. He was a
  3699	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tforsaken, friendless boy, he said; nobody loved him; when they found out
  3700	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhat they had driven him to, perhaps they would be sorry; he had tried
  3701	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto do right and get along, but they would not let him; since nothing
  3702	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twould do them but to be rid of him, let it be so; and let them blame
  3703	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t_him_ for the consequences--why shouldn’t they? What right had the
  3704	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfriendless to complain? Yes, they had forced him to it at last: he would
  3705	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlead a life of crime. There was no choice.
  3706	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3707	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBy this time he was far down Meadow Lane, and the bell for school to
  3708	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“take up” tinkled faintly upon his ear. He sobbed, now, to think he
  3709	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tshould never, never hear that old familiar sound any more--it was very
  3710	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thard, but it was forced on him; since he was driven out into the cold
  3711	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tworld, he must submit--but he forgave them. Then the sobs came thick and
  3712	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfast.
  3713	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3714	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tJust at this point he met his soul’s sworn comrade, Joe
  3715	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHarper--hard-eyed, and with evidently a great and dismal purpose in his
  3716	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\theart. Plainly here were “two souls with but a single thought.” Tom,
  3717	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twiping his eyes with his sleeve, began to blubber out something about
  3718	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta resolution to escape from hard usage and lack of sympathy at home by
  3719	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\troaming abroad into the great world never to return; and ended by hoping
  3720	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat Joe would not forget him.
  3721	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3722	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBut it transpired that this was a request which Joe had just been going
  3723	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto make of Tom, and had come to hunt him up for that purpose. His mother
  3724	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thad whipped him for drinking some cream which he had never tasted and
  3725	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tknew nothing about; it was plain that she was tired of him and wished
  3726	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thim to go; if she felt that way, there was nothing for him to do but
  3727	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsuccumb; he hoped she would be happy, and never regret having driven her
  3728	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpoor boy out into the unfeeling world to suffer and die.
  3729	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3730	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAs the two boys walked sorrowing along, they made a new compact to stand
  3731	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tby each other and be brothers and never separate till death relieved
  3732	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthem of their troubles. Then they began to lay their plans. Joe was for
  3733	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbeing a hermit, and living on crusts in a remote cave, and dying,
  3734	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsome time, of cold and want and grief; but after listening to Tom, he
  3735	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tconceded that there were some conspicuous advantages about a life of
  3736	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcrime, and so he consented to be a pirate.
  3737	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3738	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThree miles below St. Petersburg, at a point where the Mississippi River
  3739	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas a trifle over a mile wide, there was a long, narrow, wooded island,
  3740	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twith a shallow bar at the head of it, and this offered well as a
  3741	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\trendezvous. It was not inhabited; it lay far over toward the further
  3742	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tshore, abreast a dense and almost wholly unpeopled forest. So Jackson’s
  3743	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tIsland was chosen. Who were to be the subjects of their piracies was a
  3744	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmatter that did not occur to them. Then they hunted up Huckleberry Finn,
  3745	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand he joined them promptly, for all careers were one to him; he was
  3746	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tindifferent. They presently separated to meet at a lonely spot on the
  3747	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\triver-bank two miles above the village at the favorite hour--which was
  3748	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmidnight. There was a small log raft there which they meant to capture.
  3749	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tEach would bring hooks and lines, and such provision as he could steal
  3750	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin the most dark and mysterious way--as became outlaws. And before the
  3751	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tafternoon was done, they had all managed to enjoy the sweet glory of
  3752	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tspreading the fact that pretty soon the town would “hear something.” All
  3753	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twho got this vague hint were cautioned to “be mum and wait.”
  3754	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3755	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAbout midnight Tom arrived with a boiled ham and a few trifles,
  3756	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand stopped in a dense undergrowth on a small bluff overlooking the
  3757	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmeeting-place. It was starlight, and very still. The mighty river lay
  3758	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlike an ocean at rest. Tom listened a moment, but no sound disturbed the
  3759	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tquiet. Then he gave a low, distinct whistle. It was answered from under
  3760	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe bluff. Tom whistled twice more; these signals were answered in the
  3761	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsame way. Then a guarded voice said:
  3762	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3763	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Who goes there?”
  3764	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3765	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tom Sawyer, the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main. Name your names.”
  3766	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3767	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Huck Finn the Red-Handed, and Joe Harper the Terror of the Seas.” Tom
  3768	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thad furnished these titles, from his favorite literature.
  3769	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3770	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“‘Tis well. Give the countersign.”
  3771	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3772	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTwo hoarse whispers delivered the same awful word simultaneously to the
  3773	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbrooding night:
  3774	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3775	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Blood_!”
  3776	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3777	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThen Tom tumbled his ham over the bluff and let himself down after it,
  3778	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttearing both skin and clothes to some extent in the effort. There was
  3779	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tan easy, comfortable path along the shore under the bluff, but it lacked
  3780	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe advantages of difficulty and danger so valued by a pirate.
  3781	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3782	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe Terror of the Seas had brought a side of bacon, and had about worn
  3783	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thimself out with getting it there. Finn the Red-Handed had stolen a
  3784	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tskillet and a quantity of half-cured leaf tobacco, and had also brought
  3785	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta few corn-cobs to make pipes with. But none of the pirates smoked or
  3786	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“chewed” but himself. The Black Avenger of the Spanish Main said it
  3787	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twould never do to start without some fire. That was a wise thought;
  3788	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmatches were hardly known there in that day. They saw a fire smouldering
  3789	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tupon a great raft a hundred yards above, and they went stealthily
  3790	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthither and helped themselves to a chunk. They made an imposing
  3791	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tadventure of it, saying, “Hist!” every now and then, and suddenly
  3792	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thalting with finger on lip; moving with hands on imaginary dagger-hilts;
  3793	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand giving orders in dismal whispers that if “the foe” stirred, to “let
  3794	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thim have it to the hilt,” because “dead men tell no tales.” They knew
  3795	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twell enough that the raftsmen were all down at the village laying
  3796	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin stores or having a spree, but still that was no excuse for their
  3797	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tconducting this thing in an unpiratical way.
  3798	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3799	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThey shoved off, presently, Tom in command, Huck at the after oar and
  3800	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tJoe at the forward. Tom stood amidships, gloomy-browed, and with folded
  3801	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tarms, and gave his orders in a low, stern whisper:
  3802	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3803	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Luff, and bring her to the wind!”
  3804	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3805	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Aye-aye, sir!”
  3806	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3807	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Steady, steady-y-y-y!”
  3808	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3809	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Steady it is, sir!”
  3810	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3811	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Let her go off a point!”
  3812	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3813	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Point it is, sir!”
  3814	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3815	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAs the boys steadily and monotonously drove the raft toward mid-stream
  3816	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tit was no doubt understood that these orders were given only for
  3817	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“style,” and were not intended to mean anything in particular.
  3818	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3819	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“What sail’s she carrying?”
  3820	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3821	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Courses, tops’ls, and flying-jib, sir.”
  3822	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3823	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Send the r’yals up! Lay out aloft, there, half a dozen of
  3824	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tye--foretopmaststuns’l! Lively, now!”
  3825	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3826	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Aye-aye, sir!”
  3827	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3828	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Shake out that maintogalans’l! Sheets and braces! _now_ my hearties!”
  3829	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3830	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Aye-aye, sir!”
  3831	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3832	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hellum-a-lee--hard a port! Stand by to meet her when she comes! Port,
  3833	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tport! _Now_, men! With a will! Stead-y-y-y!”
  3834	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3835	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Steady it is, sir!”
  3836	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3837	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe raft drew beyond the middle of the river; the boys pointed her head
  3838	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tright, and then lay on their oars. The river was not high, so there was
  3839	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnot more than a two or three mile current. Hardly a word was said during
  3840	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe next three-quarters of an hour. Now the raft was passing before
  3841	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe distant town. Two or three glimmering lights showed where it lay,
  3842	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpeacefully sleeping, beyond the vague vast sweep of star-gemmed water,
  3843	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tunconscious of the tremendous event that was happening. The Black
  3844	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAvenger stood still with folded arms, “looking his last” upon the scene
  3845	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof his former joys and his later sufferings, and wishing “she” could see
  3846	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thim now, abroad on the wild sea, facing peril and death with dauntless
  3847	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\theart, going to his doom with a grim smile on his lips. It was but
  3848	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta small strain on his imagination to remove Jackson’s Island beyond
  3849	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\teye-shot of the village, and so he “looked his last” with a broken and
  3850	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsatisfied heart. The other pirates were looking their last, too; and
  3851	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthey all looked so long that they came near letting the current drift
  3852	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthem out of the range of the island. But they discovered the danger in
  3853	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttime, and made shift to avert it. About two o’clock in the morning the
  3854	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\traft grounded on the bar two hundred yards above the head of the island,
  3855	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand they waded back and forth until they had landed their freight. Part
  3856	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof the little raft’s belongings consisted of an old sail, and this they
  3857	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tspread over a nook in the bushes for a tent to shelter their provisions;
  3858	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbut they themselves would sleep in the open air in good weather, as
  3859	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbecame outlaws.
  3860	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3861	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThey built a fire against the side of a great log twenty or thirty steps
  3862	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twithin the sombre depths of the forest, and then cooked some bacon in
  3863	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe frying-pan for supper, and used up half of the corn “pone” stock
  3864	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthey had brought. It seemed glorious sport to be feasting in that wild,
  3865	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfree way in the virgin forest of an unexplored and uninhabited island,
  3866	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfar from the haunts of men, and they said they never would return to
  3867	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcivilization. The climbing fire lit up their faces and threw its ruddy
  3868	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tglare upon the pillared tree-trunks of their forest temple, and upon the
  3869	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tvarnished foliage and festooning vines.
  3870	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3871	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen the last crisp slice of bacon was gone, and the last allowance
  3872	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof corn pone devoured, the boys stretched themselves out on the grass,
  3873	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfilled with contentment. They could have found a cooler place, but
  3874	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthey would not deny themselves such a romantic feature as the roasting
  3875	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcampfire.
  3876	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3877	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Ain’t_ it gay?” said Joe.
  3878	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3879	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s _nuts_!” said Tom. “What would the boys say if they could see us?”
  3880	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3881	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Say? Well, they’d just die to be here--hey, Hucky!”
  3882	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3883	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I reckon so,” said Huckleberry; “anyways, I’m suited. I don’t want
  3884	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnothing better’n this. I don’t ever get enough to eat, gen’ally--and here
  3885	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthey can’t come and pick at a feller and bullyrag him so.”
  3886	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3887	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s just the life for me,” said Tom. “You don’t have to get up,
  3888	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmornings, and you don’t have to go to school, and wash, and all that
  3889	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tblame foolishness. You see a pirate don’t have to do _anything_, Joe,
  3890	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhen he’s ashore, but a hermit _he_ has to be praying considerable, and
  3891	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthen he don’t have any fun, anyway, all by himself that way.”
  3892	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3893	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh yes, that’s so,” said Joe, “but I hadn’t thought much about it, you
  3894	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tknow. I’d a good deal rather be a pirate, now that I’ve tried it.”
  3895	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3896	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“You see,” said Tom, “people don’t go much on hermits, nowadays, like
  3897	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthey used to in old times, but a pirate’s always respected. And
  3898	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta hermit’s got to sleep on the hardest place he can find, and put
  3899	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsackcloth and ashes on his head, and stand out in the rain, and--”
  3900	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3901	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“What does he put sackcloth and ashes on his head for?” inquired Huck.
  3902	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3903	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I dono. But they’ve _got_ to do it. Hermits always do. You’d have to do
  3904	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat if you was a hermit.”
  3905	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3906	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Dern’d if I would,” said Huck.
  3907	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3908	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, what would you do?”
  3909	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3910	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I dono. But I wouldn’t do that.”
  3911	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3912	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, Huck, you’d _have_ to. How’d you get around it?”
  3913	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3914	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, I just wouldn’t stand it. I’d run away.”
  3915	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3916	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Run away! Well, you _would_ be a nice old slouch of a hermit. You’d be
  3917	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta disgrace.”
  3918	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3919	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe Red-Handed made no response, being better employed. He had finished
  3920	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgouging out a cob, and now he fitted a weed stem to it, loaded it with
  3921	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttobacco, and was pressing a coal to the charge and blowing a cloud of
  3922	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfragrant smoke--he was in the full bloom of luxurious contentment. The
  3923	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tother pirates envied him this majestic vice, and secretly resolved to
  3924	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tacquire it shortly. Presently Huck said:
  3925	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3926	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“What does pirates have to do?”
  3927	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3928	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom said:
  3929	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3930	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, they have just a bully time--take ships and burn them, and get the
  3931	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmoney and bury it in awful places in their island where there’s ghosts
  3932	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand things to watch it, and kill everybody in the ships--make ‘em walk a
  3933	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tplank.”
  3934	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3935	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“And they carry the women to the island,” said Joe; “they don’t kill the
  3936	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twomen.”
  3937	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3938	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No,” assented Tom, “they don’t kill the women--they’re too noble. And
  3939	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe women’s always beautiful, too.
  3940	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3941	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“And don’t they wear the bulliest clothes! Oh no! All gold and silver
  3942	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand di’monds,” said Joe, with enthusiasm.
  3943	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3944	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Who?” said Huck.
  3945	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3946	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, the pirates.”
  3947	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3948	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHuck scanned his own clothing forlornly.
  3949	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3950	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I reckon I ain’t dressed fitten for a pirate,” said he, with a
  3951	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tregretful pathos in his voice; “but I ain’t got none but these.”
  3952	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3953	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBut the other boys told him the fine clothes would come fast enough,
  3954	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tafter they should have begun their adventures. They made him understand
  3955	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat his poor rags would do to begin with, though it was customary for
  3956	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twealthy pirates to start with a proper wardrobe.
  3957	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3958	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tGradually their talk died out and drowsiness began to steal upon the
  3959	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\teyelids of the little waifs. The pipe dropped from the fingers of the
  3960	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tRed-Handed, and he slept the sleep of the conscience-free and the weary.
  3961	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe Terror of the Seas and the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main had
  3962	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmore difficulty in getting to sleep. They said their prayers inwardly,
  3963	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand lying down, since there was nobody there with authority to make them
  3964	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tkneel and recite aloud; in truth, they had a mind not to say them at
  3965	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tall, but they were afraid to proceed to such lengths as that, lest they
  3966	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmight call down a sudden and special thunderbolt from heaven. Then at
  3967	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tonce they reached and hovered upon the imminent verge of sleep--but an
  3968	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tintruder came, now, that would not “down.” It was conscience. They began
  3969	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto feel a vague fear that they had been doing wrong to run away; and
  3970	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnext they thought of the stolen meat, and then the real torture came.
  3971	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThey tried to argue it away by reminding conscience that they had
  3972	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpurloined sweetmeats and apples scores of times; but conscience was not
  3973	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto be appeased by such thin plausibilities; it seemed to them, in the
  3974	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tend, that there was no getting around the stubborn fact that taking
  3975	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsweetmeats was only “hooking,” while taking bacon and hams and such
  3976	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tvaluables was plain simple stealing--and there was a command against that
  3977	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin the Bible. So they inwardly resolved that so long as they remained in
  3978	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe business, their piracies should not again be sullied with the
  3979	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcrime of stealing. Then conscience granted a truce, and these curiously
  3980	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tinconsistent pirates fell peacefully to sleep.
  3981	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3982	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3983	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3984	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3985	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XIV
  3986	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3987	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tWHEN Tom awoke in the morning, he wondered where he was. He sat up and
  3988	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\trubbed his eyes and looked around. Then he comprehended. It was the cool
  3989	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgray dawn, and there was a delicious sense of repose and peace in the
  3990	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdeep pervading calm and silence of the woods. Not a leaf stirred; not
  3991	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta sound obtruded upon great Nature’s meditation. Beaded dewdrops stood
  3992	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tupon the leaves and grasses. A white layer of ashes covered the fire,
  3993	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand a thin blue breath of smoke rose straight into the air. Joe and Huck
  3994	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstill slept.
  3995	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  3996	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tNow, far away in the woods a bird called; another answered; presently
  3997	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe hammering of a woodpecker was heard. Gradually the cool dim gray
  3998	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof the morning whitened, and as gradually sounds multiplied and life
  3999	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmanifested itself. The marvel of Nature shaking off sleep and going
  4000	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto work unfolded itself to the musing boy. A little green worm came
  4001	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcrawling over a dewy leaf, lifting two-thirds of his body into the air
  4002	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfrom time to time and “sniffing around,” then proceeding again--for he
  4003	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas measuring, Tom said; and when the worm approached him, of its own
  4004	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\taccord, he sat as still as a stone, with his hopes rising and falling,
  4005	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tby turns, as the creature still came toward him or seemed inclined to
  4006	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgo elsewhere; and when at last it considered a painful moment with its
  4007	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcurved body in the air and then came decisively down upon Tom’s leg and
  4008	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbegan a journey over him, his whole heart was glad--for that meant that
  4009	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\the was going to have a new suit of clothes--without the shadow of a
  4010	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdoubt a gaudy piratical uniform. Now a procession of ants appeared,
  4011	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfrom nowhere in particular, and went about their labors; one struggled
  4012	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmanfully by with a dead spider five times as big as itself in its arms,
  4013	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand lugged it straight up a tree-trunk. A brown spotted lady-bug climbed
  4014	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe dizzy height of a grass blade, and Tom bent down close to it and
  4015	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid, “Lady-bug, lady-bug, fly away home, your house is on fire, your
  4016	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tchildren’s alone,” and she took wing and went off to see about it--which
  4017	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdid not surprise the boy, for he knew of old that this insect was
  4018	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcredulous about conflagrations, and he had practised upon its simplicity
  4019	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmore than once. A tumblebug came next, heaving sturdily at its ball, and
  4020	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom touched the creature, to see it shut its legs against its body
  4021	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand pretend to be dead. The birds were fairly rioting by this time. A
  4022	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcatbird, the Northern mocker, lit in a tree over Tom’s head, and trilled
  4023	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tout her imitations of her neighbors in a rapture of enjoyment; then
  4024	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta shrill jay swept down, a flash of blue flame, and stopped on a twig
  4025	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\talmost within the boy’s reach, cocked his head to one side and eyed the
  4026	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstrangers with a consuming curiosity; a gray squirrel and a big fellow
  4027	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof the “fox” kind came skurrying along, sitting up at intervals to
  4028	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tinspect and chatter at the boys, for the wild things had probably never
  4029	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tseen a human being before and scarcely knew whether to be afraid or not.
  4030	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAll Nature was wide awake and stirring, now; long lances of sunlight
  4031	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpierced down through the dense foliage far and near, and a few
  4032	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbutterflies came fluttering upon the scene.
  4033	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4034	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom stirred up the other pirates and they all clattered away with
  4035	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta shout, and in a minute or two were stripped and chasing after and
  4036	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttumbling over each other in the shallow limpid water of the white
  4037	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsandbar. They felt no longing for the little village sleeping in the
  4038	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdistance beyond the majestic waste of water. A vagrant current or a
  4039	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tslight rise in the river had carried off their raft, but this only
  4040	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgratified them, since its going was something like burning the bridge
  4041	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbetween them and civilization.
  4042	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4043	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThey came back to camp wonderfully refreshed, glad-hearted, and
  4044	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\travenous; and they soon had the camp-fire blazing up again. Huck found a
  4045	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tspring of clear cold water close by, and the boys made cups of broad oak
  4046	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tor hickory leaves, and felt that water, sweetened with such a wildwood
  4047	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcharm as that, would be a good enough substitute for coffee. While Joe
  4048	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas slicing bacon for breakfast, Tom and Huck asked him to hold on a
  4049	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tminute; they stepped to a promising nook in the river-bank and threw in
  4050	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttheir lines; almost immediately they had reward. Joe had not had time
  4051	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto get impatient before they were back again with some handsome bass,
  4052	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta couple of sun-perch and a small catfish--provisions enough for quite a
  4053	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfamily. They fried the fish with the bacon, and were astonished; for
  4054	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tno fish had ever seemed so delicious before. They did not know that the
  4055	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tquicker a fresh-water fish is on the fire after he is caught the better
  4056	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\the is; and they reflected little upon what a sauce open-air sleeping,
  4057	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\topen-air exercise, bathing, and a large ingredient of hunger make, too.
  4058	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4059	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThey lay around in the shade, after breakfast, while Huck had a smoke,
  4060	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand then went off through the woods on an exploring expedition. They
  4061	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttramped gayly along, over decaying logs, through tangled underbrush,
  4062	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tamong solemn monarchs of the forest, hung from their crowns to the
  4063	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tground with a drooping regalia of grape-vines. Now and then they came
  4064	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tupon snug nooks carpeted with grass and jeweled with flowers.
  4065	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4066	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThey found plenty of things to be delighted with, but nothing to be
  4067	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tastonished at. They discovered that the island was about three miles
  4068	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlong and a quarter of a mile wide, and that the shore it lay closest to
  4069	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas only separated from it by a narrow channel hardly two hundred yards
  4070	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twide. They took a swim about every hour, so it was close upon the middle
  4071	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof the afternoon when they got back to camp. They were too hungry to
  4072	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstop to fish, but they fared sumptuously upon cold ham, and then threw
  4073	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthemselves down in the shade to talk. But the talk soon began to drag,
  4074	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand then died. The stillness, the solemnity that brooded in the woods,
  4075	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand the sense of loneliness, began to tell upon the spirits of the boys.
  4076	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThey fell to thinking. A sort of undefined longing crept upon them. This
  4077	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttook dim shape, presently--it was budding homesickness. Even Finn the
  4078	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tRed-Handed was dreaming of his doorsteps and empty hogsheads. But they
  4079	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twere all ashamed of their weakness, and none was brave enough to speak
  4080	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\this thought.
  4081	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4082	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tFor some time, now, the boys had been dully conscious of a peculiar
  4083	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsound in the distance, just as one sometimes is of the ticking of a
  4084	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tclock which he takes no distinct note of. But now this mysterious sound
  4085	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbecame more pronounced, and forced a recognition. The boys started,
  4086	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tglanced at each other, and then each assumed a listening attitude. There
  4087	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas a long silence, profound and unbroken; then a deep, sullen boom came
  4088	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfloating down out of the distance.
  4089	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4090	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“What is it!” exclaimed Joe, under his breath.
  4091	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4092	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I wonder,” said Tom in a whisper.
  4093	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4094	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“‘Tain’t thunder,” said Huckleberry, in an awed tone, “becuz thunder--”
  4095	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4096	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hark!” said Tom. “Listen--don’t talk.”
  4097	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4098	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThey waited a time that seemed an age, and then the same muffled boom
  4099	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttroubled the solemn hush.
  4100	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4101	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Let’s go and see.”
  4102	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4103	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThey sprang to their feet and hurried to the shore toward the town. They
  4104	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tparted the bushes on the bank and peered out over the water. The little
  4105	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsteam ferry-boat was about a mile below the village, drifting with the
  4106	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcurrent. Her broad deck seemed crowded with people. There were a great
  4107	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmany skiffs rowing about or floating with the stream in the neighborhood
  4108	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof the ferryboat, but the boys could not determine what the men in
  4109	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthem were doing. Presently a great jet of white smoke burst from the
  4110	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tferryboat’s side, and as it expanded and rose in a lazy cloud, that same
  4111	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdull throb of sound was borne to the listeners again.
  4112	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4113	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I know now!” exclaimed Tom; “somebody’s drownded!”
  4114	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4115	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“That’s it!” said Huck; “they done that last summer, when Bill Turner
  4116	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgot drownded; they shoot a cannon over the water, and that makes
  4117	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thim come up to the top. Yes, and they take loaves of bread and put
  4118	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tquicksilver in ‘em and set ‘em afloat, and wherever there’s anybody
  4119	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat’s drownded, they’ll float right there and stop.”
  4120	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4121	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, I’ve heard about that,” said Joe. “I wonder what makes the bread
  4122	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdo that.”
  4123	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4124	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, it ain’t the bread, so much,” said Tom; “I reckon it’s mostly what
  4125	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthey _say_ over it before they start it out.”
  4126	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4127	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“But they don’t say anything over it,” said Huck. “I’ve seen ‘em and
  4128	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthey don’t.”
  4129	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4130	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, that’s funny,” said Tom. “But maybe they say it to themselves. Of
  4131	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t_course_ they do. Anybody might know that.”
  4132	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4133	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe other boys agreed that there was reason in what Tom said, because
  4134	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tan ignorant lump of bread, uninstructed by an incantation, could not
  4135	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbe expected to act very intelligently when set upon an errand of such
  4136	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgravity.
  4137	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4138	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“By jings, I wish I was over there, now,” said Joe.
  4139	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4140	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I do too” said Huck “I’d give heaps to know who it is.”
  4141	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4142	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe boys still listened and watched. Presently a revealing thought
  4143	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tflashed through Tom’s mind, and he exclaimed:
  4144	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4145	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Boys, I know who’s drownded--it’s us!”
  4146	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4147	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThey felt like heroes in an instant. Here was a gorgeous triumph; they
  4148	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twere missed; they were mourned; hearts were breaking on their account;
  4149	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttears were being shed; accusing memories of unkindness to these poor
  4150	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlost lads were rising up, and unavailing regrets and remorse were being
  4151	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tindulged; and best of all, the departed were the talk of the whole town,
  4152	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand the envy of all the boys, as far as this dazzling notoriety was
  4153	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tconcerned. This was fine. It was worth while to be a pirate, after all.
  4154	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4155	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAs twilight drew on, the ferryboat went back to her accustomed business
  4156	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand the skiffs disappeared. The pirates returned to camp. They were
  4157	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tjubilant with vanity over their new grandeur and the illustrious trouble
  4158	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthey were making. They caught fish, cooked supper and ate it, and then
  4159	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfell to guessing at what the village was thinking and saying about them;
  4160	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand the pictures they drew of the public distress on their account were
  4161	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgratifying to look upon--from their point of view. But when the shadows
  4162	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof night closed them in, they gradually ceased to talk, and sat gazing
  4163	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tinto the fire, with their minds evidently wandering elsewhere. The
  4164	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\texcitement was gone, now, and Tom and Joe could not keep back thoughts
  4165	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof certain persons at home who were not enjoying this fine frolic as
  4166	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmuch as they were. Misgivings came; they grew troubled and unhappy; a
  4167	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsigh or two escaped, unawares. By and by Joe timidly ventured upon a
  4168	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\troundabout “feeler” as to how the others might look upon a return to
  4169	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcivilization--not right now, but--
  4170	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4171	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom withered him with derision! Huck, being uncommitted as yet, joined
  4172	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin with Tom, and the waverer quickly “explained,” and was glad to get
  4173	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tout of the scrape with as little taint of chicken-hearted home-sickness
  4174	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tclinging to his garments as he could. Mutiny was effectually laid to
  4175	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\trest for the moment.
  4176	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4177	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAs the night deepened, Huck began to nod, and presently to snore.
  4178	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tJoe followed next. Tom lay upon his elbow motionless, for some time,
  4179	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twatching the two intently. At last he got up cautiously, on his knees,
  4180	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand went searching among the grass and the flickering reflections flung
  4181	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tby the campfire. He picked up and inspected several large semi-cylinders
  4182	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof the thin white bark of a sycamore, and finally chose two which seemed
  4183	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto suit him. Then he knelt by the fire and painfully wrote something
  4184	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tupon each of these with his “red keel”; one he rolled up and put in his
  4185	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tjacket pocket, and the other he put in Joe’s hat and removed it to a
  4186	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlittle distance from the owner. And he also put into the hat certain
  4187	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tschoolboy treasures of almost inestimable value--among them a lump of
  4188	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tchalk, an India-rubber ball, three fishhooks, and one of that kind
  4189	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof marbles known as a “sure ‘nough crystal.” Then he tiptoed his way
  4190	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcautiously among the trees till he felt that he was out of hearing, and
  4191	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstraightway broke into a keen run in the direction of the sandbar.
  4192	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4193	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4194	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4195	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4196	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XV
  4197	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4198	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tA few minutes later Tom was in the shoal water of the bar, wading toward
  4199	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe Illinois shore. Before the depth reached his middle he was halfway
  4200	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tover; the current would permit no more wading, now, so he struck out
  4201	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tconfidently to swim the remaining hundred yards. He swam quartering
  4202	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tupstream, but still was swept downward rather faster than he had
  4203	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\texpected. However, he reached the shore finally, and drifted along till
  4204	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\the found a low place and drew himself out. He put his hand on his jacket
  4205	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpocket, found his piece of bark safe, and then struck through the woods,
  4206	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfollowing the shore, with streaming garments. Shortly before ten
  4207	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\to’clock he came out into an open place opposite the village, and saw the
  4208	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tferryboat lying in the shadow of the trees and the high bank. Everything
  4209	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas quiet under the blinking stars. He crept down the bank, watching
  4210	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twith all his eyes, slipped into the water, swam three or four strokes
  4211	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand climbed into the skiff that did “yawl” duty at the boat’s stern. He
  4212	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlaid himself down under the thwarts and waited, panting.
  4213	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4214	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tPresently the cracked bell tapped and a voice gave the order to “cast
  4215	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\toff.” A minute or two later the skiff’s head was standing high up,
  4216	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tagainst the boat’s swell, and the voyage was begun. Tom felt happy in
  4217	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\this success, for he knew it was the boat’s last trip for the night. At
  4218	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe end of a long twelve or fifteen minutes the wheels stopped, and
  4219	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom slipped overboard and swam ashore in the dusk, landing fifty yards
  4220	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdownstream, out of danger of possible stragglers.
  4221	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4222	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHe flew along unfrequented alleys, and shortly found himself at his
  4223	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\taunt’s back fence. He climbed over, approached the “ell,” and looked
  4224	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin at the sitting-room window, for a light was burning there. There
  4225	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsat Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, and Joe Harper’s mother, grouped together,
  4226	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttalking. They were by the bed, and the bed was between them and the
  4227	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdoor. Tom went to the door and began to softly lift the latch; then
  4228	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\the pressed gently and the door yielded a crack; he continued pushing
  4229	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcautiously, and quaking every time it creaked, till he judged he might
  4230	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsqueeze through on his knees; so he put his head through and began,
  4231	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twarily.
  4232	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4233	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“What makes the candle blow so?” said Aunt Polly. Tom hurried up. “Why,
  4234	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat door’s open, I believe. Why, of course it is. No end of strange
  4235	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthings now. Go ‘long and shut it, Sid.”
  4236	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4237	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom disappeared under the bed just in time. He lay and “breathed”
  4238	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t himself for a time, and then crept to where he could almost touch his
  4239	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\taunt’s foot.
  4240	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4241	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“But as I was saying,” said Aunt Polly, “he warn’t _bad_, so to say--only
  4242	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmisch_ee_vous. Only just giddy, and harum-scarum, you know. He warn’t
  4243	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tany more responsible than a colt. _He_ never meant any harm, and he was
  4244	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe best-hearted boy that ever was”--and she began to cry.
  4245	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4246	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“It was just so with my Joe--always full of his devilment, and up to
  4247	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tevery kind of mischief, but he was just as unselfish and kind as he
  4248	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcould be--and laws bless me, to think I went and whipped him for taking
  4249	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat cream, never once recollecting that I throwed it out myself because
  4250	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tit was sour, and I never to see him again in this world, never, never,
  4251	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnever, poor abused boy!” And Mrs. Harper sobbed as if her heart would
  4252	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbreak.
  4253	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4254	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I hope Tom’s better off where he is,” said Sid, “but if he’d been
  4255	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbetter in some ways--”
  4256	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4257	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Sid!_” Tom felt the glare of the old lady’s eye, though he could not
  4258	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsee it. “Not a word against my Tom, now that he’s gone! God’ll take care
  4259	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof _him_--never you trouble _your_self, sir! Oh, Mrs. Harper, I don’t
  4260	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tknow how to give him up! I don’t know how to give him up! He was such a
  4261	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcomfort to me, although he tormented my old heart out of me, ‘most.”
  4262	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4263	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“The Lord giveth and the Lord hath taken away--Blessed be the name of
  4264	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe Lord! But it’s so hard--Oh, it’s so hard! Only last Saturday my Joe
  4265	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbusted a firecracker right under my nose and I knocked him sprawling.
  4266	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tLittle did I know then, how soon--Oh, if it was to do over again I’d hug
  4267	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thim and bless him for it.”
  4268	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4269	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, yes, yes, I know just how you feel, Mrs. Harper, I know just
  4270	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\texactly how you feel. No longer ago than yesterday noon, my Tom took
  4271	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand filled the cat full of Pain-killer, and I did think the cretur would
  4272	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttear the house down. And God forgive me, I cracked Tom’s head with my
  4273	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthimble, poor boy, poor dead boy. But he’s out of all his troubles now.
  4274	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd the last words I ever heard him say was to reproach--”
  4275	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4276	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBut this memory was too much for the old lady, and she broke entirely
  4277	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdown. Tom was snuffling, now, himself--and more in pity of himself than
  4278	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tanybody else. He could hear Mary crying, and putting in a kindly word
  4279	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfor him from time to time. He began to have a nobler opinion of himself
  4280	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthan ever before. Still, he was sufficiently touched by his aunt’s grief
  4281	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto long to rush out from under the bed and overwhelm her with joy--and
  4282	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe theatrical gorgeousness of the thing appealed strongly to his
  4283	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnature, too, but he resisted and lay still.
  4284	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4285	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHe went on listening, and gathered by odds and ends that it was
  4286	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tconjectured at first that the boys had got drowned while taking a swim;
  4287	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthen the small raft had been missed; next, certain boys said the missing
  4288	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlads had promised that the village should “hear something” soon; the
  4289	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twise-heads had “put this and that together” and decided that the lads
  4290	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thad gone off on that raft and would turn up at the next town below,
  4291	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpresently; but toward noon the raft had been found, lodged against the
  4292	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tMissouri shore some five or six miles below the village--and then hope
  4293	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tperished; they must be drowned, else hunger would have driven them home
  4294	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tby nightfall if not sooner. It was believed that the search for the
  4295	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbodies had been a fruitless effort merely because the drowning must
  4296	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thave occurred in mid-channel, since the boys, being good swimmers, would
  4297	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\totherwise have escaped to shore. This was Wednesday night. If the bodies
  4298	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcontinued missing until Sunday, all hope would be given over, and the
  4299	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfunerals would be preached on that morning. Tom shuddered.
  4300	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4301	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tMrs. Harper gave a sobbing goodnight and turned to go. Then with a
  4302	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmutual impulse the two bereaved women flung themselves into each other’s
  4303	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tarms and had a good, consoling cry, and then parted. Aunt Polly was
  4304	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttender far beyond her wont, in her goodnight to Sid and Mary. Sid
  4305	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsnuffled a bit and Mary went off crying with all her heart.
  4306	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4307	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAunt Polly knelt down and prayed for Tom so touchingly, so appealingly,
  4308	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand with such measureless love in her words and her old trembling voice,
  4309	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat he was weltering in tears again, long before she was through.
  4310	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4311	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHe had to keep still long after she went to bed, for she kept making
  4312	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbroken-hearted ejaculations from time to time, tossing unrestfully, and
  4313	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tturning over. But at last she was still, only moaning a little in her
  4314	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsleep. Now the boy stole out, rose gradually by the bedside, shaded the
  4315	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcandle-light with his hand, and stood regarding her. His heart was full
  4316	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof pity for her. He took out his sycamore scroll and placed it by the
  4317	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcandle. But something occurred to him, and he lingered considering.
  4318	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHis face lighted with a happy solution of his thought; he put the bark
  4319	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thastily in his pocket. Then he bent over and kissed the faded lips, and
  4320	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstraightway made his stealthy exit, latching the door behind him.
  4321	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4322	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHe threaded his way back to the ferry landing, found nobody at large
  4323	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthere, and walked boldly on board the boat, for he knew she was
  4324	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttenantless except that there was a watchman, who always turned in and
  4325	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tslept like a graven image. He untied the skiff at the stern, slipped
  4326	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tinto it, and was soon rowing cautiously upstream. When he had pulled a
  4327	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmile above the village, he started quartering across and bent himself
  4328	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstoutly to his work. He hit the landing on the other side neatly, for
  4329	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthis was a familiar bit of work to him. He was moved to capture
  4330	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe skiff, arguing that it might be considered a ship and therefore
  4331	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlegitimate prey for a pirate, but he knew a thorough search would be
  4332	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmade for it and that might end in revelations. So he stepped ashore and
  4333	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tentered the woods.
  4334	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4335	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHe sat down and took a long rest, torturing himself meanwhile to keep
  4336	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tawake, and then started warily down the home-stretch. The night was far
  4337	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tspent. It was broad daylight before he found himself fairly abreast the
  4338	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tisland bar. He rested again until the sun was well up and gilding the
  4339	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgreat river with its splendor, and then he plunged into the stream. A
  4340	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlittle later he paused, dripping, upon the threshold of the camp, and
  4341	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\theard Joe say:
  4342	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4343	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, Tom’s true-blue, Huck, and he’ll come back. He won’t desert. He
  4344	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tknows that would be a disgrace to a pirate, and Tom’s too proud for that
  4345	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsort of thing. He’s up to something or other. Now I wonder what?”
  4346	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4347	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, the things is ours, anyway, ain’t they?”
  4348	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4349	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Pretty near, but not yet, Huck. The writing says they are if he ain’t
  4350	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tback here to breakfast.”
  4351	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4352	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Which he is!” exclaimed Tom, with fine dramatic effect, stepping
  4353	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgrandly into camp.
  4354	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4355	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tA sumptuous breakfast of bacon and fish was shortly provided, and as the
  4356	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tboys set to work upon it, Tom recounted (and adorned) his adventures.
  4357	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThey were a vain and boastful company of heroes when the tale was done.
  4358	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThen Tom hid himself away in a shady nook to sleep till noon, and the
  4359	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tother pirates got ready to fish and explore.
  4360	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4361	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4362	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4363	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4364	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XVI
  4365	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4366	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAFTER dinner all the gang turned out to hunt for turtle eggs on the bar.
  4367	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThey went about poking sticks into the sand, and when they found a soft
  4368	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tplace they went down on their knees and dug with their hands. Sometimes
  4369	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthey would take fifty or sixty eggs out of one hole. They were perfectly
  4370	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tround white things a trifle smaller than an English walnut. They had a
  4371	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfamous fried-egg feast that night, and another on Friday morning.
  4372	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4373	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAfter breakfast they went whooping and prancing out on the bar, and
  4374	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tchased each other round and round, shedding clothes as they went, until
  4375	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthey were naked, and then continued the frolic far away up the shoal
  4376	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twater of the bar, against the stiff current, which latter tripped their
  4377	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlegs from under them from time to time and greatly increased the fun.
  4378	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd now and then they stooped in a group and splashed water in each
  4379	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tother’s faces with their palms, gradually approaching each other, with
  4380	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\taverted faces to avoid the strangling sprays, and finally gripping and
  4381	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstruggling till the best man ducked his neighbor, and then they all
  4382	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twent under in a tangle of white legs and arms and came up blowing,
  4383	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsputtering, laughing, and gasping for breath at one and the same time.
  4384	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4385	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen they were well exhausted, they would run out and sprawl on the dry,
  4386	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thot sand, and lie there and cover themselves up with it, and by and by
  4387	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbreak for the water again and go through the original performance once
  4388	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmore. Finally it occurred to them that their naked skin represented
  4389	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tflesh-colored “tights” very fairly; so they drew a ring in the sand and
  4390	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thad a circus--with three clowns in it, for none would yield this proudest
  4391	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpost to his neighbor.
  4392	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4393	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tNext they got their marbles and played “knucks” and “ringtaw” and
  4394	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“keeps” till that amusement grew stale. Then Joe and Huck had another
  4395	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tswim, but Tom would not venture, because he found that in kicking off
  4396	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\this trousers he had kicked his string of rattlesnake rattles off his
  4397	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tankle, and he wondered how he had escaped cramp so long without the
  4398	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tprotection of this mysterious charm. He did not venture again until he
  4399	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thad found it, and by that time the other boys were tired and ready to
  4400	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\trest. They gradually wandered apart, dropped into the “dumps,” and
  4401	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfell to gazing longingly across the wide river to where the village lay
  4402	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdrowsing in the sun. Tom found himself writing “BECKY” in the sand with
  4403	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\this big toe; he scratched it out, and was angry with himself for his
  4404	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tweakness. But he wrote it again, nevertheless; he could not help it. He
  4405	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\terased it once more and then took himself out of temptation by driving
  4406	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe other boys together and joining them.
  4407	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4408	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBut Joe’s spirits had gone down almost beyond resurrection. He was so
  4409	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thomesick that he could hardly endure the misery of it. The tears lay
  4410	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tvery near the surface. Huck was melancholy, too. Tom was downhearted,
  4411	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbut tried hard not to show it. He had a secret which he was not ready
  4412	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto tell, yet, but if this mutinous depression was not broken up soon, he
  4413	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twould have to bring it out. He said, with a great show of cheerfulness:
  4414	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4415	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I bet there’s been pirates on this island before, boys. We’ll explore
  4416	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tit again. They’ve hid treasures here somewhere. How’d you feel to light
  4417	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ton a rotten chest full of gold and silver--hey?”
  4418	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4419	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBut it roused only faint enthusiasm, which faded out, with no reply.
  4420	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom tried one or two other seductions; but they failed, too. It was
  4421	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdiscouraging work. Joe sat poking up the sand with a stick and looking
  4422	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tvery gloomy. Finally he said:
  4423	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4424	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, boys, let’s give it up. I want to go home. It’s so lonesome.”
  4425	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4426	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh no, Joe, you’ll feel better by and by,” said Tom. “Just think of the
  4427	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfishing that’s here.”
  4428	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4429	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I don’t care for fishing. I want to go home.”
  4430	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4431	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“But, Joe, there ain’t such another swimming-place anywhere.”
  4432	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4433	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Swimming’s no good. I don’t seem to care for it, somehow, when there
  4434	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tain’t anybody to say I sha’n’t go in. I mean to go home.”
  4435	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4436	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, shucks! Baby! You want to see your mother, I reckon.”
  4437	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4438	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, I _do_ want to see my mother--and you would, too, if you had one. I
  4439	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tain’t any more baby than you are.” And Joe snuffled a little.
  4440	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4441	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, we’ll let the crybaby go home to his mother, won’t we, Huck? Poor
  4442	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthing--does it want to see its mother? And so it shall. You like it here,
  4443	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdon’t you, Huck? We’ll stay, won’t we?”
  4444	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4445	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHuck said, “Y-e-s”--without any heart in it.
  4446	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4447	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’ll never speak to you again as long as I live,” said Joe, rising.
  4448	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“There now!” And he moved moodily away and began to dress himself.
  4449	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4450	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Who cares!” said Tom. “Nobody wants you to. Go ‘long home and get
  4451	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlaughed at. Oh, you’re a nice pirate. Huck and me ain’t crybabies. We’ll
  4452	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstay, won’t we, Huck? Let him go if he wants to. I reckon we can get
  4453	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\talong without him, per’aps.”
  4454	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4455	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBut Tom was uneasy, nevertheless, and was alarmed to see Joe go sullenly
  4456	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ton with his dressing. And then it was discomforting to see Huck eying
  4457	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tJoe’s preparations so wistfully, and keeping up such an ominous silence.
  4458	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tPresently, without a parting word, Joe began to wade off toward the
  4459	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tIllinois shore. Tom’s heart began to sink. He glanced at Huck. Huck
  4460	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcould not bear the look, and dropped his eyes. Then he said:
  4461	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4462	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I want to go, too, Tom. It was getting so lonesome anyway, and now
  4463	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tit’ll be worse. Let’s us go, too, Tom.”
  4464	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4465	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I won’t! You can all go, if you want to. I mean to stay.”
  4466	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4467	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tom, I better go.”
  4468	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4469	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, go ‘long--who’s hendering you.”
  4470	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4471	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHuck began to pick up his scattered clothes. He said:
  4472	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4473	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tom, I wisht you’d come, too. Now you think it over. We’ll wait for you
  4474	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhen we get to shore.”
  4475	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4476	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, you’ll wait a blame long time, that’s all.”
  4477	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4478	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHuck started sorrowfully away, and Tom stood looking after him, with a
  4479	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstrong desire tugging at his heart to yield his pride and go along
  4480	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttoo. He hoped the boys would stop, but they still waded slowly on. It
  4481	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsuddenly dawned on Tom that it was become very lonely and still. He made
  4482	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tone final struggle with his pride, and then darted after his comrades,
  4483	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tyelling:
  4484	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4485	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Wait! Wait! I want to tell you something!”
  4486	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4487	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThey presently stopped and turned around. When he got to where they
  4488	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twere, he began unfolding his secret, and they listened moodily till
  4489	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tat last they saw the “point” he was driving at, and then they set up a
  4490	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twarwhoop of applause and said it was “splendid!” and said if he had
  4491	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttold them at first, they wouldn’t have started away. He made a plausible
  4492	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\texcuse; but his real reason had been the fear that not even the secret
  4493	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twould keep them with him any very great length of time, and so he had
  4494	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmeant to hold it in reserve as a last seduction.
  4495	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4496	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe lads came gayly back and went at their sports again with a will,
  4497	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tchattering all the time about Tom’s stupendous plan and admiring the
  4498	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgenius of it. After a dainty egg and fish dinner, Tom said he wanted to
  4499	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlearn to smoke, now. Joe caught at the idea and said he would like to
  4500	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttry, too. So Huck made pipes and filled them. These novices had never
  4501	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsmoked anything before but cigars made of grapevine, and they “bit” the
  4502	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttongue, and were not considered manly anyway.
  4503	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4504	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tNow they stretched themselves out on their elbows and began to puff,
  4505	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcharily, and with slender confidence. The smoke had an unpleasant taste,
  4506	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand they gagged a little, but Tom said:
  4507	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4508	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, it’s just as easy! If I’d a knowed this was all, I’d a learnt long
  4509	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tago.”
  4510	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4511	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“So would I,” said Joe. “It’s just nothing.”
  4512	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4513	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, many a time I’ve looked at people smoking, and thought well I wish
  4514	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tI could do that; but I never thought I could,” said Tom.
  4515	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4516	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“That’s just the way with me, hain’t it, Huck? You’ve heard me talk just
  4517	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat way--haven’t you, Huck? I’ll leave it to Huck if I haven’t.”
  4518	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4519	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes--heaps of times,” said Huck.
  4520	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4521	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I have too,” said Tom; “oh, hundreds of times. Once down by the
  4522	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tslaughter-house. Don’t you remember, Huck? Bob Tanner was there, and
  4523	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tJohnny Miller, and Jeff Thatcher, when I said it. Don’t you remember,
  4524	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHuck, ‘bout me saying that?”
  4525	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4526	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, that’s so,” said Huck. “That was the day after I lost a white
  4527	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\talley. No, ‘twas the day before.”
  4528	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4529	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“There--I told you so,” said Tom. “Huck recollects it.”
  4530	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4531	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I bleeve I could smoke this pipe all day,” said Joe. “I don’t feel
  4532	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsick.”
  4533	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4534	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Neither do I,” said Tom. “I could smoke it all day. But I bet you Jeff
  4535	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThatcher couldn’t.”
  4536	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4537	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Jeff Thatcher! Why, he’d keel over just with two draws. Just let him
  4538	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttry it once. _He’d_ see!”
  4539	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4540	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I bet he would. And Johnny Miller--I wish could see Johnny Miller tackle
  4541	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tit once.”
  4542	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4543	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, don’t I!” said Joe. “Why, I bet you Johnny Miller couldn’t any more
  4544	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdo this than nothing. Just one little snifter would fetch _him_.”
  4545	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4546	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“‘Deed it would, Joe. Say--I wish the boys could see us now.”
  4547	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4548	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“So do I.”
  4549	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4550	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Say--boys, don’t say anything about it, and some time when they’re
  4551	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\taround, I’ll come up to you and say, ‘Joe, got a pipe? I want a smoke.’
  4552	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd you’ll say, kind of careless like, as if it warn’t anything, you’ll
  4553	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsay, ‘Yes, I got my _old_ pipe, and another one, but my tobacker ain’t
  4554	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tvery good.’ And I’ll say, ‘Oh, that’s all right, if it’s _strong_
  4555	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tenough.’ And then you’ll out with the pipes, and we’ll light up just as
  4556	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tca’m, and then just see ‘em look!”
  4557	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4558	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“By jings, that’ll be gay, Tom! I wish it was _now_!”
  4559	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4560	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“So do I! And when we tell ‘em we learned when we was off pirating,
  4561	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twon’t they wish they’d been along?”
  4562	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4563	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, I reckon not! I’ll just _bet_ they will!”
  4564	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4565	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tSo the talk ran on. But presently it began to flag a trifle, and
  4566	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgrow disjointed. The silences widened; the expectoration marvellously
  4567	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tincreased. Every pore inside the boys’ cheeks became a spouting
  4568	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfountain; they could scarcely bail out the cellars under their tongues
  4569	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfast enough to prevent an inundation; little overflowings down their
  4570	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthroats occurred in spite of all they could do, and sudden retchings
  4571	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfollowed every time. Both boys were looking very pale and miserable,
  4572	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnow. Joe’s pipe dropped from his nerveless fingers. Tom’s followed. Both
  4573	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfountains were going furiously and both pumps bailing with might and
  4574	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmain. Joe said feebly:
  4575	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4576	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’ve lost my knife. I reckon I better go and find it.”
  4577	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4578	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom said, with quivering lips and halting utterance:
  4579	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4580	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’ll help you. You go over that way and I’ll hunt around by the spring.
  4581	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tNo, you needn’t come, Huck--we can find it.”
  4582	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4583	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tSo Huck sat down again, and waited an hour. Then he found it lonesome,
  4584	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand went to find his comrades. They were wide apart in the woods, both
  4585	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tvery pale, both fast asleep. But something informed him that if they had
  4586	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thad any trouble they had got rid of it.
  4587	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4588	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThey were not talkative at supper that night. They had a humble look,
  4589	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand when Huck prepared his pipe after the meal and was going to prepare
  4590	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttheirs, they said no, they were not feeling very well--something they ate
  4591	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tat dinner had disagreed with them.
  4592	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4593	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAbout midnight Joe awoke, and called the boys. There was a brooding
  4594	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\toppressiveness in the air that seemed to bode something. The boys
  4595	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thuddled themselves together and sought the friendly companionship of
  4596	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe fire, though the dull dead heat of the breathless atmosphere was
  4597	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstifling. They sat still, intent and waiting. The solemn hush continued.
  4598	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBeyond the light of the fire everything was swallowed up in the
  4599	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tblackness of darkness. Presently there came a quivering glow that
  4600	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tvaguely revealed the foliage for a moment and then vanished. By and by
  4601	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tanother came, a little stronger. Then another. Then a faint moan came
  4602	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsighing through the branches of the forest and the boys felt a fleeting
  4603	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbreath upon their cheeks, and shuddered with the fancy that the Spirit
  4604	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof the Night had gone by. There was a pause. Now a weird flash turned
  4605	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnight into day and showed every little grassblade, separate and
  4606	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdistinct, that grew about their feet. And it showed three white,
  4607	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstartled faces, too. A deep peal of thunder went rolling and tumbling
  4608	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdown the heavens and lost itself in sullen rumblings in the distance. A
  4609	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsweep of chilly air passed by, rustling all the leaves and snowing the
  4610	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tflaky ashes broadcast about the fire. Another fierce glare lit up the
  4611	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tforest and an instant crash followed that seemed to rend the treetops
  4612	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tright over the boys’ heads. They clung together in terror, in the thick
  4613	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgloom that followed. A few big raindrops fell pattering upon the leaves.
  4614	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4615	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Quick! boys, go for the tent!” exclaimed Tom.
  4616	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4617	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThey sprang away, stumbling over roots and among vines in the dark, no
  4618	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttwo plunging in the same direction. A furious blast roared through
  4619	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe trees, making everything sing as it went. One blinding flash after
  4620	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tanother came, and peal on peal of deafening thunder. And now a drenching
  4621	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\train poured down and the rising hurricane drove it in sheets along the
  4622	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tground. The boys cried out to each other, but the roaring wind and the
  4623	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbooming thunderblasts drowned their voices utterly. However, one by one
  4624	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthey straggled in at last and took shelter under the tent, cold, scared,
  4625	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand streaming with water; but to have company in misery seemed something
  4626	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto be grateful for. They could not talk, the old sail flapped so
  4627	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfuriously, even if the other noises would have allowed them. The tempest
  4628	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\trose higher and higher, and presently the sail tore loose from its
  4629	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfastenings and went winging away on the blast. The boys seized each
  4630	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tothers’ hands and fled, with many tumblings and bruises, to the shelter
  4631	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof a great oak that stood upon the riverbank. Now the battle was at its
  4632	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thighest. Under the ceaseless conflagration of lightning that flamed
  4633	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin the skies, everything below stood out in cleancut and shadowless
  4634	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdistinctness: the bending trees, the billowy river, white with foam, the
  4635	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdriving spray of spumeflakes, the dim outlines of the high bluffs on
  4636	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe other side, glimpsed through the drifting cloudrack and the slanting
  4637	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tveil of rain. Every little while some giant tree yielded the fight
  4638	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand fell crashing through the younger growth; and the unflagging
  4639	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthunderpeals came now in ear-splitting explosive bursts, keen and sharp,
  4640	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand unspeakably appalling. The storm culminated in one matchless effort
  4641	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat seemed likely to tear the island to pieces, burn it up, drown it to
  4642	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe treetops, blow it away, and deafen every creature in it, all at one
  4643	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand the same moment. It was a wild night for homeless young heads to be
  4644	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tout in.
  4645	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4646	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBut at last the battle was done, and the forces retired with weaker and
  4647	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tweaker threatenings and grumblings, and peace resumed her sway. The
  4648	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tboys went back to camp, a good deal awed; but they found there was still
  4649	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsomething to be thankful for, because the great sycamore, the shelter
  4650	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof their beds, was a ruin, now, blasted by the lightnings, and they were
  4651	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnot under it when the catastrophe happened.
  4652	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4653	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tEverything in camp was drenched, the campfire as well; for they were but
  4654	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\theedless lads, like their generation, and had made no provision against
  4655	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\train. Here was matter for dismay, for they were soaked through and
  4656	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tchilled. They were eloquent in their distress; but they presently
  4657	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdiscovered that the fire had eaten so far up under the great log it had
  4658	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbeen built against (where it curved upward and separated itself from
  4659	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe ground), that a handbreadth or so of it had escaped wetting; so they
  4660	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpatiently wrought until, with shreds and bark gathered from the under
  4661	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsides of sheltered logs, they coaxed the fire to burn again. Then they
  4662	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpiled on great dead boughs till they had a roaring furnace, and were
  4663	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgladhearted once more. They dried their boiled ham and had a feast,
  4664	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand after that they sat by the fire and expanded and glorified their
  4665	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmidnight adventure until morning, for there was not a dry spot to sleep
  4666	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ton, anywhere around.
  4667	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4668	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAs the sun began to steal in upon the boys, drowsiness came over
  4669	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthem, and they went out on the sandbar and lay down to sleep. They got
  4670	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tscorched out by and by, and drearily set about getting breakfast. After
  4671	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe meal they felt rusty, and stiff-jointed, and a little homesick once
  4672	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmore. Tom saw the signs, and fell to cheering up the pirates as well as
  4673	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\the could. But they cared nothing for marbles, or circus, or swimming, or
  4674	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tanything. He reminded them of the imposing secret, and raised a ray of
  4675	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcheer. While it lasted, he got them interested in a new device. This was
  4676	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto knock off being pirates, for a while, and be Indians for a change.
  4677	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThey were attracted by this idea; so it was not long before they were
  4678	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstripped, and striped from head to heel with black mud, like so many
  4679	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tzebras--all of them chiefs, of course--and then they went tearing through
  4680	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe woods to attack an English settlement.
  4681	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4682	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBy and by they separated into three hostile tribes, and darted upon each
  4683	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tother from ambush with dreadful warwhoops, and killed and scalped each
  4684	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tother by thousands. It was a gory day. Consequently it was an extremely
  4685	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsatisfactory one.
  4686	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4687	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThey assembled in camp toward suppertime, hungry and happy; but now
  4688	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta difficulty arose--hostile Indians could not break the bread of
  4689	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thospitality together without first making peace, and this was a simple
  4690	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\timpossibility without smoking a pipe of peace. There was no other
  4691	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tprocess that ever they had heard of. Two of the savages almost wished
  4692	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthey had remained pirates. However, there was no other way; so with such
  4693	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tshow of cheerfulness as they could muster they called for the pipe and
  4694	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttook their whiff as it passed, in due form.
  4695	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4696	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd behold, they were glad they had gone into savagery, for they had
  4697	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgained something; they found that they could now smoke a little without
  4698	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thaving to go and hunt for a lost knife; they did not get sick enough to
  4699	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbe seriously uncomfortable. They were not likely to fool away this high
  4700	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpromise for lack of effort. No, they practised cautiously, after supper,
  4701	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twith right fair success, and so they spent a jubilant evening. They were
  4702	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tprouder and happier in their new acquirement than they would have been
  4703	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin the scalping and skinning of the Six Nations. We will leave them to
  4704	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsmoke and chatter and brag, since we have no further use for them at
  4705	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpresent.
  4706	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4707	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t

  4710	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XVII
  4711	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4712	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBUT there was no hilarity in the little town that same tranquil Saturday
  4713	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tafternoon. The Harpers, and Aunt Polly’s family, were being put into
  4714	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmourning, with great grief and many tears. An unusual quiet possessed
  4715	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe village, although it was ordinarily quiet enough, in all conscience.
  4716	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe villagers conducted their concerns with an absent air, and talked
  4717	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlittle; but they sighed often. The Saturday holiday seemed a burden to
  4718	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe children. They had no heart in their sports, and gradually gave them
  4719	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tup.
  4720	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4721	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tIn the afternoon Becky Thatcher found herself moping about the deserted
  4722	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tschoolhouse yard, and feeling very melancholy. But she found nothing
  4723	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthere to comfort her. She soliloquized:
  4724	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4725	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, if I only had a brass andiron-knob again! But I haven’t got
  4726	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tanything now to remember him by.” And she choked back a little sob.
  4727	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4728	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tPresently she stopped, and said to herself:
  4729	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4730	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“It was right here. Oh, if it was to do over again, I wouldn’t say
  4731	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat--I wouldn’t say it for the whole world. But he’s gone now; I’ll
  4732	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnever, never, never see him any more.”
  4733	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4734	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThis thought broke her down, and she wandered away, with tears rolling
  4735	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdown her cheeks. Then quite a group of boys and girls--playmates of Tom’s
  4736	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand Joe’s--came by, and stood looking over the paling fence and talking
  4737	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin reverent tones of how Tom did so-and-so the last time they saw
  4738	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thim, and how Joe said this and that small trifle (pregnant with awful
  4739	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tprophecy, as they could easily see now!)--and each speaker pointed out
  4740	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe exact spot where the lost lads stood at the time, and then added
  4741	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsomething like “and I was a-standing just so--just as I am now, and as if
  4742	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tyou was him--I was as close as that--and he smiled, just this way--and then
  4743	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsomething seemed to go all over me, like--awful, you know--and I never
  4744	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthought what it meant, of course, but I can see now!”
  4745	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4746	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThen there was a dispute about who saw the dead boys last in life, and
  4747	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmany claimed that dismal distinction, and offered evidences, more or
  4748	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tless tampered with by the witness; and when it was ultimately decided
  4749	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twho _did_ see the departed last, and exchanged the last words with them,
  4750	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe lucky parties took upon themselves a sort of sacred importance,
  4751	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand were gaped at and envied by all the rest. One poor chap, who had
  4752	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tno other grandeur to offer, said with tolerably manifest pride in the
  4753	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tremembrance:
  4754	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4755	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, Tom Sawyer he licked me once.”
  4756	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4757	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBut that bid for glory was a failure. Most of the boys could say that,
  4758	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand so that cheapened the distinction too much. The group loitered away,
  4759	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstill recalling memories of the lost heroes, in awed voices.
  4760	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4761	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen the Sunday-school hour was finished, the next morning, the bell
  4762	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbegan to toll, instead of ringing in the usual way. It was a very still
  4763	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tSabbath, and the mournful sound seemed in keeping with the musing hush
  4764	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat lay upon nature. The villagers began to gather, loitering a moment
  4765	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin the vestibule to converse in whispers about the sad event. But there
  4766	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas no whispering in the house; only the funereal rustling of dresses
  4767	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tas the women gathered to their seats disturbed the silence there. None
  4768	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcould remember when the little church had been so full before. There
  4769	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas finally a waiting pause, an expectant dumbness, and then Aunt Polly
  4770	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tentered, followed by Sid and Mary, and they by the Harper family, all in
  4771	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdeep black, and the whole congregation, the old minister as well, rose
  4772	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\treverently and stood until the mourners were seated in the front pew.
  4773	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThere was another communing silence, broken at intervals by muffled
  4774	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsobs, and then the minister spread his hands abroad and prayed. A moving
  4775	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thymn was sung, and the text followed: “I am the Resurrection and the
  4776	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tLife.”
  4777	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4778	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAs the service proceeded, the clergyman drew such pictures of the
  4779	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgraces, the winning ways, and the rare promise of the lost lads that
  4780	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tevery soul there, thinking he recognized these pictures, felt a pang
  4781	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin remembering that he had persistently blinded himself to them always
  4782	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore, and had as persistently seen only faults and flaws in the poor
  4783	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tboys. The minister related many a touching incident in the lives of the
  4784	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdeparted, too, which illustrated their sweet, generous natures, and the
  4785	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpeople could easily see, now, how noble and beautiful those episodes
  4786	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twere, and remembered with grief that at the time they occurred they had
  4787	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tseemed rank rascalities, well deserving of the cowhide. The congregation
  4788	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbecame more and more moved, as the pathetic tale went on, till at last
  4789	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe whole company broke down and joined the weeping mourners in a chorus
  4790	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof anguished sobs, the preacher himself giving way to his feelings, and
  4791	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcrying in the pulpit.
  4792	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4793	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThere was a rustle in the gallery, which nobody noticed; a moment later
  4794	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe church door creaked; the minister raised his streaming eyes above
  4795	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\this handkerchief, and stood transfixed! First one and then another pair
  4796	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof eyes followed the minister’s, and then almost with one impulse the
  4797	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcongregation rose and stared while the three dead boys came marching up
  4798	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe aisle, Tom in the lead, Joe next, and Huck, a ruin of drooping rags,
  4799	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsneaking sheepishly in the rear! They had been hid in the unused gallery
  4800	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlistening to their own funeral sermon!
  4801	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4802	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAunt Polly, Mary, and the Harpers threw themselves upon their restored
  4803	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tones, smothered them with kisses and poured out thanksgivings, while
  4804	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpoor Huck stood abashed and uncomfortable, not knowing exactly what
  4805	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto do or where to hide from so many unwelcoming eyes. He wavered, and
  4806	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstarted to slink away, but Tom seized him and said:
  4807	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4808	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Aunt Polly, it ain’t fair. Somebody’s got to be glad to see Huck.”
  4809	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4810	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“And so they shall. I’m glad to see him, poor motherless thing!” And
  4811	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe loving attentions Aunt Polly lavished upon him were the one thing
  4812	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcapable of making him more uncomfortable than he was before.
  4813	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4814	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tSuddenly the minister shouted at the top of his voice: “Praise God from
  4815	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhom all blessings flow--_sing_!--and put your hearts in it!”
  4816	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4817	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd they did. Old Hundred swelled up with a triumphant burst, and
  4818	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhile it shook the rafters Tom Sawyer the Pirate looked around upon the
  4819	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tenvying juveniles about him and confessed in his heart that this was the
  4820	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tproudest moment of his life.
  4821	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4822	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAs the “sold” congregation trooped out they said they would almost be
  4823	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twilling to be made ridiculous again to hear Old Hundred sung like that
  4824	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tonce more.
  4825	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4826	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom got more cuffs and kisses that day--according to Aunt Polly’s varying
  4827	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmoods--than he had earned before in a year; and he hardly knew which
  4828	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\texpressed the most gratefulness to God and affection for himself.
  4829	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4830	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4831	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4832	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4833	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XVIII
  4834	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4835	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTHAT was Tom’s great secret--the scheme to return home with his brother
  4836	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpirates and attend their own funerals. They had paddled over to the
  4837	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tMissouri shore on a log, at dusk on Saturday, landing five or six miles
  4838	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbelow the village; they had slept in the woods at the edge of the town
  4839	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttill nearly daylight, and had then crept through back lanes and alleys
  4840	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand finished their sleep in the gallery of the church among a chaos of
  4841	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tinvalided benches.
  4842	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4843	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAt breakfast, Monday morning, Aunt Polly and Mary were very loving to
  4844	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom, and very attentive to his wants. There was an unusual amount of
  4845	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttalk. In the course of it Aunt Polly said:
  4846	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4847	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I don’t say it wasn’t a fine joke, Tom, to keep everybody
  4848	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsuffering ‘most a week so you boys had a good time, but it is a pity you
  4849	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcould be so hard-hearted as to let me suffer so. If you could come over
  4850	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ton a log to go to your funeral, you could have come over and give me a
  4851	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thint some way that you warn’t dead, but only run off.”
  4852	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4853	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, you could have done that, Tom,” said Mary; “and I believe you
  4854	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twould if you had thought of it.”
  4855	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4856	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Would you, Tom?” said Aunt Polly, her face lighting wistfully. “Say,
  4857	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnow, would you, if you’d thought of it?”
  4858	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4859	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I--well, I don’t know. ‘Twould ‘a’ spoiled everything.”
  4860	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4861	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tom, I hoped you loved me that much,” said Aunt Polly, with a grieved
  4862	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttone that discomforted the boy. “It would have been something if you’d
  4863	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcared enough to _think_ of it, even if you didn’t _do_ it.”
  4864	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4865	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now, auntie, that ain’t any harm,” pleaded Mary; “it’s only Tom’s giddy
  4866	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tway--he is always in such a rush that he never thinks of anything.”
  4867	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4868	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“More’s the pity. Sid would have thought. And Sid would have come and
  4869	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t_done_ it, too. Tom, you’ll look back, some day, when it’s too late,
  4870	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand wish you’d cared a little more for me when it would have cost you so
  4871	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlittle.”
  4872	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4873	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now, auntie, you know I do care for you,” said Tom.
  4874	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4875	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’d know it better if you acted more like it.”
  4876	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4877	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I wish now I’d thought,” said Tom, with a repentant tone; “but I dreamt
  4878	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tabout you, anyway. That’s something, ain’t it?”
  4879	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4880	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“It ain’t much--a cat does that much--but it’s better than nothing. What
  4881	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdid you dream?”
  4882	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4883	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, Wednesday night I dreamt that you was sitting over there by the
  4884	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbed, and Sid was sitting by the woodbox, and Mary next to him.”
  4885	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4886	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, so we did. So we always do. I’m glad your dreams could take even
  4887	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat much trouble about us.”
  4888	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4889	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“And I dreamt that Joe Harper’s mother was here.”
  4890	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4891	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, she was here! Did you dream any more?”
  4892	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4893	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, lots. But it’s so dim, now.”
  4894	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4895	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, try to recollect--can’t you?”
  4896	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4897	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Somehow it seems to me that the wind--the wind blowed the--the--”
  4898	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4899	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Try harder, Tom! The wind did blow something. Come!”
  4900	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4901	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom pressed his fingers on his forehead an anxious minute, and then
  4902	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid:
  4903	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4904	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’ve got it now! I’ve got it now! It blowed the candle!”
  4905	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4906	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Mercy on us! Go on, Tom--go on!”
  4907	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4908	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“And it seems to me that you said, ‘Why, I believe that that door--’”
  4909	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4910	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Go _on_, Tom!”
  4911	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4912	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Just let me study a moment--just a moment. Oh, yes--you said you believed
  4913	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe door was open.”
  4914	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4915	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“As I’m sitting here, I did! Didn’t I, Mary! Go on!”
  4916	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4917	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“And then--and then--well I won’t be certain, but it seems like as if you
  4918	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmade Sid go and--and--”
  4919	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4920	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well? Well? What did I make him do, Tom? What did I make him do?”
  4921	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4922	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“You made him--you--Oh, you made him shut it.”
  4923	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4924	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, for the land’s sake! I never heard the beat of that in all my
  4925	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdays! Don’t tell _me_ there ain’t anything in dreams, any more. Sereny
  4926	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHarper shall know of this before I’m an hour older. I’d like to see her
  4927	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tget around _this_ with her rubbage ‘bout superstition. Go on, Tom!”
  4928	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4929	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, it’s all getting just as bright as day, now. Next you said I warn’t
  4930	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t_bad_, only mischeevous and harum-scarum, and not any more responsible
  4931	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthan--than--I think it was a colt, or something.”
  4932	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4933	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“And so it was! Well, goodness gracious! Go on, Tom!”
  4934	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4935	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“And then you began to cry.”
  4936	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4937	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“So I did. So I did. Not the first time, neither. And then--”
  4938	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4939	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Then Mrs. Harper she began to cry, and said Joe was just the same, and
  4940	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tshe wished she hadn’t whipped him for taking cream when she’d throwed it
  4941	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tout her own self--”
  4942	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4943	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tom! The sperrit was upon you! You was a prophesying--that’s what you
  4944	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas doing! Land alive, go on, Tom!”
  4945	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4946	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Then Sid he said--he said--”
  4947	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4948	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I don’t think I said anything,” said Sid.
  4949	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4950	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes you did, Sid,” said Mary.
  4951	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4952	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Shut your heads and let Tom go on! What did he say, Tom?”
  4953	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4954	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“He said--I _think_ he said he hoped I was better off where I was gone
  4955	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto, but if I’d been better sometimes--”
  4956	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4957	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“_There_, d’you hear that! It was his very words!”
  4958	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4959	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“And you shut him up sharp.”
  4960	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4961	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I lay I did! There must ‘a’ been an angel there. There _was_ an angel

  4963	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4964	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“And Mrs. Harper told about Joe scaring her with a firecracker, and you
  4965	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttold about Peter and the Pain-killer--”
  4966	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4967	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Just as true as I live!”
  4968	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4969	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“And then there was a whole lot of talk ‘bout dragging the river for us,
  4970	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand ‘bout having the funeral Sunday, and then you and old Miss Harper
  4971	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thugged and cried, and she went.”
  4972	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4973	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“It happened just so! It happened just so, as sure as I’m a-sitting in

  4975	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tit! And then what? Go on, Tom!”
  4976	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4977	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Then I thought you prayed for me--and I could see you and hear every

  4979	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twrote on a piece of sycamore bark, ‘We ain’t dead--we are only off being
  4980	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpirates,’ and put it on the table by the candle; and then you looked

  4984	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Did you, Tom, _did_ you! I just forgive you everything for that!” And
  4985	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tshe seized the boy in a crushing embrace that made him feel like the
  4986	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tguiltiest of villains.
  4987	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4988	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“It was very kind, even though it was only a--dream,” Sid soliloquized
  4989	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tjust audibly.
  4990	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  4991	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Shut up, Sid! A body does just the same in a dream as he’d do if he was
  4992	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tawake. Here’s a big Milum apple I’ve been saving for you, Tom, if you
  4993	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas ever found again--now go ‘long to school. I’m thankful to the good
  4994	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tGod and Father of us all I’ve got you back, that’s long-suffering and
  4995	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmerciful to them that believe on Him and keep His word, though goodness
  4996	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tknows I’m unworthy of it, but if only the worthy ones got His blessings
  4997	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand had His hand to help them over the rough places, there’s few enough
  4998	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twould smile here or ever enter into His rest when the long night comes.
  4999	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tGo ‘long Sid, Mary, Tom--take yourselves off--you’ve hendered me long
  5000	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tenough.”
  5001	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5002	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe children left for school, and the old lady to call on Mrs. Harper
  5003	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand vanquish her realism with Tom’s marvellous dream. Sid had better
  5004	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tjudgment than to utter the thought that was in his mind as he left the
  5005	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thouse. It was this: “Pretty thin--as long a dream as that, without any
  5006	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmistakes in it!”
  5007	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5008	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tWhat a hero Tom was become, now! He did not go skipping and prancing,
  5009	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbut moved with a dignified swagger as became a pirate who felt that the
  5010	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpublic eye was on him. And indeed it was; he tried not to seem to see
  5011	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe looks or hear the remarks as he passed along, but they were food and
  5012	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdrink to him. Smaller boys than himself flocked at his heels, as proud
  5013	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto be seen with him, and tolerated by him, as if he had been the drummer
  5014	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tat the head of a procession or the elephant leading a menagerie into
  5015	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttown. Boys of his own size pretended not to know he had been away at
  5016	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tall; but they were consuming with envy, nevertheless. They would have
  5017	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgiven anything to have that swarthy sun-tanned skin of his, and his
  5018	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tglittering notoriety; and Tom would not have parted with either for a
  5019	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcircus.
  5020	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5021	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAt school the children made so much of him and of Joe, and delivered
  5022	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsuch eloquent admiration from their eyes, that the two heroes were
  5023	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnot long in becoming insufferably “stuck-up.” They began to tell their
  5024	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tadventures to hungry listeners--but they only began; it was not a
  5025	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthing likely to have an end, with imaginations like theirs to furnish
  5026	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmaterial. And finally, when they got out their pipes and went serenely
  5027	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpuffing around, the very summit of glory was reached.
  5028	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5029	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom decided that he could be independent of Becky Thatcher now. Glory
  5030	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas sufficient. He would live for glory. Now that he was distinguished,
  5031	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmaybe she would be wanting to “make up.” Well, let her--she should see
  5032	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat he could be as indifferent as some other people. Presently she
  5033	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tarrived. Tom pretended not to see her. He moved away and joined a group
  5034	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof boys and girls and began to talk. Soon he observed that she was
  5035	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttripping gayly back and forth with flushed face and dancing eyes,
  5036	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpretending to be busy chasing schoolmates, and screaming with laughter
  5037	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhen she made a capture; but he noticed that she always made her
  5038	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcaptures in his vicinity, and that she seemed to cast a conscious eye
  5039	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin his direction at such times, too. It gratified all the vicious vanity
  5040	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat was in him; and so, instead of winning him, it only “set him up”
  5041	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t the more and made him the more diligent to avoid betraying that he
  5042	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tknew she was about. Presently she gave over skylarking, and moved
  5043	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tirresolutely about, sighing once or twice and glancing furtively and
  5044	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twistfully toward Tom. Then she observed that now Tom was talking more
  5045	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tparticularly to Amy Lawrence than to any one else. She felt a sharp pang
  5046	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand grew disturbed and uneasy at once. She tried to go away, but her
  5047	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfeet were treacherous, and carried her to the group instead. She said to
  5048	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta girl almost at Tom’s elbow--with sham vivacity:
  5049	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5050	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, Mary Austin! you bad girl, why didn’t you come to Sunday-school?”
  5051	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5052	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I did come--didn’t you see me?”
  5053	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5054	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, no! Did you? Where did you sit?”
  5055	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5056	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I was in Miss Peters’ class, where I always go. I saw _you_.”
  5057	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5058	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Did you? Why, it’s funny I didn’t see you. I wanted to tell you about
  5059	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe picnic.”
  5060	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5061	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, that’s jolly. Who’s going to give it?”
  5062	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5063	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“My ma’s going to let me have one.”
  5064	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5065	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, goody; I hope she’ll let _me_ come.”
  5066	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5067	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, she will. The picnic’s for me. She’ll let anybody come that I
  5068	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twant, and I want you.”
  5069	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5070	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“That’s ever so nice. When is it going to be?”
  5071	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5072	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“By and by. Maybe about vacation.”
  5073	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5074	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, won’t it be fun! You going to have all the girls and boys?”
  5075	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5076	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, every one that’s friends to me--or wants to be”; and she glanced
  5077	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tever so furtively at Tom, but he talked right along to Amy Lawrence
  5078	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tabout the terrible storm on the island, and how the lightning tore the
  5079	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgreat sycamore tree “all to flinders” while he was “standing within
  5080	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthree feet of it.”
  5081	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5082	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, may I come?” said Grace Miller.
  5083	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5084	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes.”
  5085	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5086	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“And me?” said Sally Rogers.
  5087	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5088	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes.”
  5089	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5090	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“And me, too?” said Susy Harper. “And Joe?”
  5091	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5092	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes.”
  5093	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5094	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd so on, with clapping of joyful hands till all the group had begged
  5095	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfor invitations but Tom and Amy. Then Tom turned coolly away, still
  5096	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttalking, and took Amy with him. Becky’s lips trembled and the tears
  5097	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcame to her eyes; she hid these signs with a forced gayety and went on
  5098	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tchattering, but the life had gone out of the picnic, now, and out of
  5099	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\teverything else; she got away as soon as she could and hid herself and
  5100	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thad what her sex call “a good cry.” Then she sat moody, with wounded
  5101	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpride, till the bell rang. She roused up, now, with a vindictive cast
  5102	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin her eye, and gave her plaited tails a shake and said she knew what
  5103	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t_she’d_ do.
  5104	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5105	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAt recess Tom continued his flirtation with Amy with jubilant
  5106	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tself-satisfaction. And he kept drifting about to find Becky and lacerate
  5107	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ther with the performance. At last he spied her, but there was a sudden
  5108	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfalling of his mercury. She was sitting cosily on a little bench behind
  5109	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe schoolhouse looking at a picture-book with Alfred Temple--and so
  5110	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tabsorbed were they, and their heads so close together over the book,
  5111	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat they did not seem to be conscious of anything in the world besides.
  5112	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tJealousy ran red-hot through Tom’s veins. He began to hate himself for
  5113	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthrowing away the chance Becky had offered for a reconciliation. He
  5114	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcalled himself a fool, and all the hard names he could think of. He
  5115	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twanted to cry with vexation. Amy chatted happily along, as they walked,
  5116	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfor her heart was singing, but Tom’s tongue had lost its function. He
  5117	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdid not hear what Amy was saying, and whenever she paused expectantly
  5118	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\the could only stammer an awkward assent, which was as often misplaced
  5119	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tas otherwise. He kept drifting to the rear of the schoolhouse, again and
  5120	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tagain, to sear his eyeballs with the hateful spectacle there. He could
  5121	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnot help it. And it maddened him to see, as he thought he saw, that
  5122	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBecky Thatcher never once suspected that he was even in the land of the
  5123	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tliving. But she did see, nevertheless; and she knew she was winning her
  5124	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfight, too, and was glad to see him suffer as she had suffered.
  5125	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5126	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAmy’s happy prattle became intolerable. Tom hinted at things he had
  5127	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto attend to; things that must be done; and time was fleeting. But in
  5128	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tvain--the girl chirped on. Tom thought, “Oh, hang her, ain’t I ever going
  5129	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto get rid of her?” At last he must be attending to those things--and she
  5130	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid artlessly that she would be “around” when school let out. And he
  5131	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thastened away, hating her for it.
  5132	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5133	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Any other boy!” Tom thought, grating his teeth. “Any boy in the whole
  5134	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttown but that Saint Louis smarty that thinks he dresses so fine and is
  5135	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\taristocracy! Oh, all right, I licked you the first day you ever saw this
  5136	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttown, mister, and I’ll lick you again! You just wait till I catch you
  5137	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tout! I’ll just take and--”
  5138	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5139	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd he went through the motions of thrashing an imaginary boy--pummelling
  5140	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe air, and kicking and gouging. “Oh, you do, do you? You holler
  5141	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t‘nough, do you? Now, then, let that learn you!” And so the imaginary
  5142	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tflogging was finished to his satisfaction.
  5143	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5144	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom fled home at noon. His conscience could not endure any more of Amy’s
  5145	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgrateful happiness, and his jealousy could bear no more of the other
  5146	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdistress. Becky resumed her picture inspections with Alfred, but as the
  5147	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tminutes dragged along and no Tom came to suffer, her triumph began to
  5148	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcloud and she lost interest; gravity and absentmindedness followed,
  5149	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand then melancholy; two or three times she pricked up her ear at
  5150	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta footstep, but it was a false hope; no Tom came. At last she grew
  5151	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tentirely miserable and wished she hadn’t carried it so far. When
  5152	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpoor Alfred, seeing that he was losing her, he did not know how, kept
  5153	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\texclaiming: “Oh, here’s a jolly one! look at this!” she lost patience at
  5154	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlast, and said, “Oh, don’t bother me! I don’t care for them!” and burst
  5155	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tinto tears, and got up and walked away.
  5156	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5157	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAlfred dropped alongside and was going to try to comfort her, but she
  5158	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid:
  5159	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5160	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Go away and leave me alone, can’t you! I hate you!”
  5161	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5162	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tSo the boy halted, wondering what he could have done--for she had said
  5163	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tshe would look at pictures all through the nooning--and she walked on,
  5164	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcrying. Then Alfred went musing into the deserted schoolhouse. He was
  5165	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thumiliated and angry. He easily guessed his way to the truth--the girl
  5166	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thad simply made a convenience of him to vent her spite upon Tom Sawyer.
  5167	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHe was far from hating Tom the less when this thought occurred to him.
  5168	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHe wished there was some way to get that boy into trouble without much
  5169	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\trisk to himself. Tom’s spelling-book fell under his eye. Here was his
  5170	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\topportunity. He gratefully opened to the lesson for the afternoon and
  5171	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpoured ink upon the page.
  5172	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5173	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBecky, glancing in at a window behind him at the moment, saw the act,
  5174	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand moved on, without discovering herself. She started homeward, now,
  5175	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tintending to find Tom and tell him; Tom would be thankful and their
  5176	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttroubles would be healed. Before she was half way home, however, she
  5177	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thad changed her mind. The thought of Tom’s treatment of her when she was
  5178	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttalking about her picnic came scorching back and filled her with shame.
  5179	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tShe resolved to let him get whipped on the damaged spelling-book’s
  5180	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\taccount, and to hate him forever, into the bargain.
  5181	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5182	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5183	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5184	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5185	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XIX
  5186	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5187	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTOM arrived at home in a dreary mood, and the first thing his aunt said
  5188	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto him showed him that he had brought his sorrows to an unpromising
  5189	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmarket:
  5190	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5191	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tom, I’ve a notion to skin you alive!”
  5192	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5193	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Auntie, what have I done?”
  5194	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5195	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, you’ve done enough. Here I go over to Sereny Harper, like an old
  5196	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsofty, expecting I’m going to make her believe all that rubbage about
  5197	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat dream, when lo and behold you she’d found out from Joe that you was
  5198	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tover here and heard all the talk we had that night. Tom, I don’t know
  5199	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhat is to become of a boy that will act like that. It makes me feel so
  5200	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbad to think you could let me go to Sereny Harper and make such a fool
  5201	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof myself and never say a word.”
  5202	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5203	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThis was a new aspect of the thing. His smartness of the morning had
  5204	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tseemed to Tom a good joke before, and very ingenious. It merely looked
  5205	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmean and shabby now. He hung his head and could not think of anything to
  5206	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsay for a moment. Then he said:
  5207	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5208	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Auntie, I wish I hadn’t done it--but I didn’t think.”
  5209	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5210	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, child, you never think. You never think of anything but your

  5212	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tJackson’s Island in the night to laugh at our troubles, and you could
  5213	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthink to fool me with a lie about a dream; but you couldn’t ever think
  5214	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto pity us and save us from sorrow.”
  5215	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5216	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Auntie, I know now it was mean, but I didn’t mean to be mean. I didn’t,
  5217	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thonest. And besides, I didn’t come over here to laugh at you that
  5218	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnight.”
  5219	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5220	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“What did you come for, then?”
  5221	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5222	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“It was to tell you not to be uneasy about us, because we hadn’t got
  5223	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdrownded.”
  5224	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5225	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tom, Tom, I would be the thankfullest soul in this world if I could
  5226	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbelieve you ever had as good a thought as that, but you know you never
  5227	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdid--and I know it, Tom.”
  5228	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5229	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Indeed and ‘deed I did, auntie--I wish I may never stir if I didn’t.”
  5230	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5231	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, Tom, don’t lie--don’t do it. It only makes things a hundred times
  5232	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tworse.”
  5233	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5234	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“It ain’t a lie, auntie; it’s the truth. I wanted to keep you from
  5235	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgrieving--that was all that made me come.”
  5236	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5237	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’d give the whole world to believe that--it would cover up a power
  5238	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof sins, Tom. I’d ‘most be glad you’d run off and acted so bad. But it
  5239	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tain’t reasonable; because, why didn’t you tell me, child?”
  5240	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5241	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, you see, when you got to talking about the funeral, I just got all
  5242	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfull of the idea of our coming and hiding in the church, and I couldn’t
  5243	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsomehow bear to spoil it. So I just put the bark back in my pocket and
  5244	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tkept mum.”
  5245	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5246	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“What bark?”
  5247	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5248	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“The bark I had wrote on to tell you we’d gone pirating. I wish, now,
  5249	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tyou’d waked up when I kissed you--I do, honest.”
  5250	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5251	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe hard lines in his aunt’s face relaxed and a sudden tenderness dawned
  5252	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin her eyes.
  5253	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5254	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Did_ you kiss me, Tom?”
  5255	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5256	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, yes, I did.”
  5257	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5258	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Are you sure you did, Tom?”
  5259	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5260	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, yes, I did, auntie--certain sure.”
  5261	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5262	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“What did you kiss me for, Tom?”
  5263	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5264	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Because I loved you so, and you laid there moaning and I was so sorry.”
  5265	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5266	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe words sounded like truth. The old lady could not hide a tremor in
  5267	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ther voice when she said:
  5268	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5269	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Kiss me again, Tom!--and be off with you to school, now, and don’t
  5270	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbother me any more.”
  5271	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5272	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe moment he was gone, she ran to a closet and got out the ruin of a
  5273	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tjacket which Tom had gone pirating in. Then she stopped, with it in her
  5274	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thand, and said to herself:
  5275	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5276	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, I don’t dare. Poor boy, I reckon he’s lied about it--but it’s a
  5277	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tblessed, blessed lie, there’s such a comfort come from it. I hope
  5278	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe Lord--I _know_ the Lord will forgive him, because it was such
  5279	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgood-heartedness in him to tell it. But I don’t want to find out it’s a
  5280	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlie. I won’t look.”
  5281	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5282	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tShe put the jacket away, and stood by musing a minute. Twice she put out
  5283	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ther hand to take the garment again, and twice she refrained. Once more
  5284	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tshe ventured, and this time she fortified herself with the thought:
  5285	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s a good lie--it’s a good lie--I won’t let it grieve me.” So she
  5286	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsought the jacket pocket. A moment later she was reading Tom’s piece of
  5287	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbark through flowing tears and saying: “I could forgive the boy, now, if
  5288	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\the’d committed a million sins!”
  5289	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5290	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5291	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5292	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5293	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XX
  5294	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5295	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTHERE was something about Aunt Polly’s manner, when she kissed Tom, that
  5296	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tswept away his low spirits and made him lighthearted and happy again. He
  5297	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstarted to school and had the luck of coming upon Becky Thatcher at the
  5298	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thead of Meadow Lane. His mood always determined his manner. Without a
  5299	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmoment’s hesitation he ran to her and said:
  5300	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5301	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I acted mighty mean today, Becky, and I’m so sorry. I won’t ever, ever
  5302	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdo that way again, as long as ever I live--please make up, won’t you?”
  5303	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5304	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe girl stopped and looked him scornfully in the face:
  5305	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5306	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’ll thank you to keep yourself _to_ yourself, Mr. Thomas Sawyer. I’ll
  5307	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnever speak to you again.”
  5308	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5309	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tShe tossed her head and passed on. Tom was so stunned that he had not
  5310	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\teven presence of mind enough to say “Who cares, Miss Smarty?” until the
  5311	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tright time to say it had gone by. So he said nothing. But he was in a
  5312	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfine rage, nevertheless. He moped into the schoolyard wishing she were
  5313	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta boy, and imagining how he would trounce her if she were. He presently
  5314	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tencountered her and delivered a stinging remark as he passed. She hurled
  5315	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tone in return, and the angry breach was complete. It seemed to Becky, in
  5316	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ther hot resentment, that she could hardly wait for school to “take in,”
  5317	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t she was so impatient to see Tom flogged for the injured spelling-book.
  5318	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tIf she had had any lingering notion of exposing Alfred Temple, Tom’s
  5319	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\toffensive fling had driven it entirely away.
  5320	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5321	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tPoor girl, she did not know how fast she was nearing trouble herself.
  5322	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe master, Mr. Dobbins, had reached middle age with an unsatisfied
  5323	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tambition. The darling of his desires was, to be a doctor, but
  5324	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpoverty had decreed that he should be nothing higher than a village
  5325	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tschoolmaster. Every day he took a mysterious book out of his desk and
  5326	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tabsorbed himself in it at times when no classes were reciting. He kept
  5327	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat book under lock and key. There was not an urchin in school but was
  5328	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tperishing to have a glimpse of it, but the chance never came. Every boy
  5329	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand girl had a theory about the nature of that book; but no two theories
  5330	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twere alike, and there was no way of getting at the facts in the case.
  5331	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tNow, as Becky was passing by the desk, which stood near the door, she
  5332	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnoticed that the key was in the lock! It was a precious moment. She
  5333	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tglanced around; found herself alone, and the next instant she had the
  5334	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbook in her hands. The titlepage--Professor Somebody’s _Anatomy_--carried
  5335	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tno information to her mind; so she began to turn the leaves. She came at
  5336	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tonce upon a handsomely engraved and colored frontispiece--a human figure,
  5337	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstark naked. At that moment a shadow fell on the page and Tom Sawyer
  5338	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstepped in at the door and caught a glimpse of the picture. Becky
  5339	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsnatched at the book to close it, and had the hard luck to tear the
  5340	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpictured page half down the middle. She thrust the volume into the desk,
  5341	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tturned the key, and burst out crying with shame and vexation.
  5342	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5343	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tom Sawyer, you are just as mean as you can be, to sneak up on a person
  5344	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand look at what they’re looking at.”
  5345	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5346	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“How could I know you was looking at anything?”
  5347	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5348	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Tom Sawyer; you know you’re
  5349	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgoing to tell on me, and oh, what shall I do, what shall I do! I’ll be
  5350	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhipped, and I never was whipped in school.”
  5351	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5352	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThen she stamped her little foot and said:
  5353	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5354	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Be_ so mean if you want to! I know something that’s going to happen.
  5355	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tYou just wait and you’ll see! Hateful, hateful, hateful!”--and she flung
  5356	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tout of the house with a new explosion of crying.
  5357	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5358	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom stood still, rather flustered by this onslaught. Presently he said
  5359	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto himself:
  5360	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5361	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“What a curious kind of a fool a girl is! Never been licked in
  5362	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tschool! Shucks! What’s a licking! That’s just like a girl--they’re so
  5363	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthin-skinned and chicken-hearted. Well, of course I ain’t going to tell
  5364	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\told Dobbins on this little fool, because there’s other ways of getting
  5365	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\teven on her, that ain’t so mean; but what of it? Old Dobbins will ask
  5366	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twho it was tore his book. Nobody’ll answer. Then he’ll do just the way
  5367	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\the always does--ask first one and then t’other, and when he comes to the
  5368	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tright girl he’ll know it, without any telling. Girls’ faces always tell
  5369	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ton them. They ain’t got any backbone. She’ll get licked. Well, it’s a
  5370	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tkind of a tight place for Becky Thatcher, because there ain’t any way
  5371	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tout of it.” Tom conned the thing a moment longer, and then added: “All
  5372	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tright, though; she’d like to see me in just such a fix--let her sweat it
  5373	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tout!”
  5374	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5375	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom joined the mob of skylarking scholars outside. In a few moments the
  5376	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmaster arrived and school “took in.” Tom did not feel a strong interest
  5377	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin his studies. Every time he stole a glance at the girls’ side of the
  5378	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\troom Becky’s face troubled him. Considering all things, he did not want
  5379	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto pity her, and yet it was all he could do to help it. He could get
  5380	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tup no exultation that was really worthy the name. Presently the
  5381	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tspelling-book discovery was made, and Tom’s mind was entirely full
  5382	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof his own matters for a while after that. Becky roused up from her
  5383	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlethargy of distress and showed good interest in the proceedings. She
  5384	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdid not expect that Tom could get out of his trouble by denying that he
  5385	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tspilt the ink on the book himself; and she was right. The denial only
  5386	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tseemed to make the thing worse for Tom. Becky supposed she would be glad
  5387	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof that, and she tried to believe she was glad of it, but she found she
  5388	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas not certain. When the worst came to the worst, she had an impulse
  5389	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto get up and tell on Alfred Temple, but she made an effort and forced
  5390	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\therself to keep still--because, said she to herself, “he’ll tell about me
  5391	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttearing the picture sure. I wouldn’t say a word, not to save his life!”
  5392	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5393	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom took his whipping and went back to his seat not at all
  5394	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbroken-hearted, for he thought it was possible that he had unknowingly
  5395	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tupset the ink on the spelling-book himself, in some skylarking bout--he
  5396	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thad denied it for form’s sake and because it was custom, and had stuck
  5397	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto the denial from principle.
  5398	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5399	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tA whole hour drifted by, the master sat nodding in his throne, the air
  5400	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas drowsy with the hum of study. By and by, Mr. Dobbins straightened
  5401	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thimself up, yawned, then unlocked his desk, and reached for his book,
  5402	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbut seemed undecided whether to take it out or leave it. Most of the
  5403	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpupils glanced up languidly, but there were two among them that watched
  5404	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\this movements with intent eyes. Mr. Dobbins fingered his book absently
  5405	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfor a while, then took it out and settled himself in his chair to read!
  5406	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom shot a glance at Becky. He had seen a hunted and helpless rabbit
  5407	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlook as she did, with a gun levelled at its head. Instantly he forgot
  5408	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\this quarrel with her. Quick--something must be done! done in a flash,
  5409	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttoo! But the very imminence of the emergency paralyzed his invention.
  5410	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tGood!--he had an inspiration! He would run and snatch the book, spring
  5411	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthrough the door and fly. But his resolution shook for one little
  5412	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tinstant, and the chance was lost--the master opened the volume. If Tom
  5413	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tonly had the wasted opportunity back again! Too late. There was no help
  5414	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfor Becky now, he said. The next moment the master faced the school.
  5415	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tEvery eye sank under his gaze. There was that in it which smote even
  5416	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe innocent with fear. There was silence while one might count ten--the
  5417	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmaster was gathering his wrath. Then he spoke: “Who tore this book?”
  5418	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5419	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThere was not a sound. One could have heard a pin drop. The stillness
  5420	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcontinued; the master searched face after face for signs of guilt.
  5421	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5422	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Benjamin Rogers, did you tear this book?”
  5423	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5424	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tA denial. Another pause.
  5425	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5426	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Joseph Harper, did you?”
  5427	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5428	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAnother denial. Tom’s uneasiness grew more and more intense under the
  5429	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tslow torture of these proceedings. The master scanned the ranks of
  5430	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tboys--considered a while, then turned to the girls:
  5431	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5432	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Amy Lawrence?”
  5433	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5434	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tA shake of the head.
  5435	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5436	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Gracie Miller?”
  5437	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5438	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe same sign.
  5439	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5440	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Susan Harper, did you do this?”
  5441	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5442	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAnother negative. The next girl was Becky Thatcher. Tom was trembling
  5443	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfrom head to foot with excitement and a sense of the hopelessness of the
  5444	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsituation.
  5445	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5446	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Rebecca Thatcher” [Tom glanced at her face--it was white with
  5447	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tterror]--“did you tear--no, look me in the face” [her hands rose in
  5448	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tappeal]--“did you tear this book?”
  5449	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5450	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tA thought shot like lightning through Tom’s brain. He sprang to his feet
  5451	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand shouted--“I done it!”
  5452	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5453	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe school stared in perplexity at this incredible folly. Tom stood a
  5454	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmoment, to gather his dismembered faculties; and when he stepped forward
  5455	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto go to his punishment the surprise, the gratitude, the adoration that
  5456	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tshone upon him out of poor Becky’s eyes seemed pay enough for a hundred
  5457	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfloggings. Inspired by the splendor of his own act, he took without
  5458	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tan outcry the most merciless flaying that even Mr. Dobbins had ever
  5459	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tadministered; and also received with indifference the added cruelty of a
  5460	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcommand to remain two hours after school should be dismissed--for he
  5461	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tknew who would wait for him outside till his captivity was done, and not
  5462	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcount the tedious time as loss, either.
  5463	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5464	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom went to bed that night planning vengeance against Alfred Temple; for
  5465	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twith shame and repentance Becky had told him all, not forgetting her own
  5466	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttreachery; but even the longing for vengeance had to give way, soon, to
  5467	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpleasanter musings, and he fell asleep at last with Becky’s latest words
  5468	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlingering dreamily in his ear--
  5469	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5470	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tom, how _could_ you be so noble!”
  5471	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t

  5475	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XXI
  5476	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5477	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tVACATION was approaching. The schoolmaster, always severe, grew severer
  5478	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand more exacting than ever, for he wanted the school to make a good
  5479	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tshowing on “Examination” day. His rod and his ferule were seldom idle
  5480	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnow--at least among the smaller pupils. Only the biggest boys, and young
  5481	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tladies of eighteen and twenty, escaped lashing. Mr. Dobbins’ lashings
  5482	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twere very vigorous ones, too; for although he carried, under his wig, a
  5483	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tperfectly bald and shiny head, he had only reached middle age, and there
  5484	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas no sign of feebleness in his muscle. As the great day approached,
  5485	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tall the tyranny that was in him came to the surface; he seemed to take a
  5486	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tvindictive pleasure in punishing the least shortcomings. The consequence
  5487	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas, that the smaller boys spent their days in terror and suffering and
  5488	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttheir nights in plotting revenge. They threw away no opportunity to do
  5489	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe master a mischief. But he kept ahead all the time. The retribution
  5490	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat followed every vengeful success was so sweeping and majestic that
  5491	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe boys always retired from the field badly worsted. At last they
  5492	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tconspired together and hit upon a plan that promised a dazzling victory.
  5493	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThey swore in the signpainter’s boy, told him the scheme, and asked his
  5494	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thelp. He had his own reasons for being delighted, for the master boarded
  5495	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin his father’s family and had given the boy ample cause to hate him.
  5496	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe master’s wife would go on a visit to the country in a few days, and
  5497	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthere would be nothing to interfere with the plan; the master always
  5498	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tprepared himself for great occasions by getting pretty well fuddled, and
  5499	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe signpainter’s boy said that when the dominie had reached the proper
  5500	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcondition on Examination Evening he would “manage the thing” while he
  5501	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnapped in his chair; then he would have him awakened at the right time
  5502	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand hurried away to school.
  5503	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5504	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tIn the fulness of time the interesting occasion arrived. At eight in
  5505	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe evening the schoolhouse was brilliantly lighted, and adorned with
  5506	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twreaths and festoons of foliage and flowers. The master sat throned in
  5507	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\this great chair upon a raised platform, with his blackboard behind him.
  5508	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHe was looking tolerably mellow. Three rows of benches on each side and
  5509	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsix rows in front of him were occupied by the dignitaries of the town
  5510	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand by the parents of the pupils. To his left, back of the rows of
  5511	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcitizens, was a spacious temporary platform upon which were seated the
  5512	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tscholars who were to take part in the exercises of the evening; rows of
  5513	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsmall boys, washed and dressed to an intolerable state of discomfort;
  5514	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\trows of gawky big boys; snowbanks of girls and young ladies clad in
  5515	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlawn and muslin and conspicuously conscious of their bare arms, their
  5516	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgrandmothers’ ancient trinkets, their bits of pink and blue ribbon and
  5517	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe flowers in their hair. All the rest of the house was filled with
  5518	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnon-participating scholars.
  5519	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5520	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe exercises began. A very little boy stood up and sheepishly recited,
  5521	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“You’d scarce expect one of my age to speak in public on the stage,”
  5522	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t etc.--accompanying himself with the painfully exact and spasmodic
  5523	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgestures which a machine might have used--supposing the machine to be a
  5524	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttrifle out of order. But he got through safely, though cruelly scared,
  5525	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand got a fine round of applause when he made his manufactured bow and
  5526	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tretired.
  5527	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5528	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tA little shamefaced girl lisped, “Mary had a little lamb,” etc.,
  5529	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tperformed a compassion-inspiring curtsy, got her meed of applause, and
  5530	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsat down flushed and happy.
  5531	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5532	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom Sawyer stepped forward with conceited confidence and soared into
  5533	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe unquenchable and indestructible “Give me liberty or give me death”
  5534	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t speech, with fine fury and frantic gesticulation, and broke down in the
  5535	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmiddle of it. A ghastly stage-fright seized him, his legs quaked under
  5536	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thim and he was like to choke. True, he had the manifest sympathy of the
  5537	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thouse but he had the house’s silence, too, which was even worse than
  5538	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tits sympathy. The master frowned, and this completed the disaster. Tom
  5539	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstruggled awhile and then retired, utterly defeated. There was a weak
  5540	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tattempt at applause, but it died early.
  5541	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5542	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“The Boy Stood on the Burning Deck” followed; also “The Assyrian Came
  5543	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tDown,” and other declamatory gems. Then there were reading exercises,
  5544	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand a spelling fight. The meagre Latin class recited with honor. The
  5545	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tprime feature of the evening was in order, now--original “compositions”
  5546	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t by the young ladies. Each in her turn stepped forward to the edge of the
  5547	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tplatform, cleared her throat, held up her manuscript (tied with dainty
  5548	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tribbon), and proceeded to read, with labored attention to “expression”
  5549	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t and punctuation. The themes were the same that had been illuminated upon
  5550	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsimilar occasions by their mothers before them, their grandmothers,
  5551	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand doubtless all their ancestors in the female line clear back to the
  5552	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tCrusades. “Friendship” was one; “Memories of Other Days”; “Religion in
  5553	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHistory”; “Dream Land”; “The Advantages of Culture”; “Forms of Political
  5554	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tGovernment Compared and Contrasted”; “Melancholy”; “Filial Love”; “Heart
  5555	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tLongings,” etc., etc.
  5556	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5557	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tA prevalent feature in these compositions was a nursed and petted
  5558	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmelancholy; another was a wasteful and opulent gush of “fine language”;
  5559	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tanother was a tendency to lug in by the ears particularly prized words
  5560	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand phrases until they were worn entirely out; and a peculiarity that
  5561	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tconspicuously marked and marred them was the inveterate and intolerable
  5562	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsermon that wagged its crippled tail at the end of each and every one
  5563	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof them. No matter what the subject might be, a brainracking effort was
  5564	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmade to squirm it into some aspect or other that the moral and religious
  5565	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmind could contemplate with edification. The glaring insincerity of
  5566	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthese sermons was not sufficient to compass the banishment of the
  5567	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfashion from the schools, and it is not sufficient today; it never will
  5568	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbe sufficient while the world stands, perhaps. There is no school in
  5569	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tall our land where the young ladies do not feel obliged to close their
  5570	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcompositions with a sermon; and you will find that the sermon of the
  5571	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmost frivolous and the least religious girl in the school is always
  5572	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe longest and the most relentlessly pious. But enough of this. Homely
  5573	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttruth is unpalatable.
  5574	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5575	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tLet us return to the “Examination.” The first composition that was read
  5576	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas one entitled “Is this, then, Life?” Perhaps the reader can endure an
  5577	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\textract from it:
  5578	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5579	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“In the common walks of life, with what delightful emotions does the
  5580	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tyouthful mind look forward to some anticipated scene of festivity!
  5581	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tImagination is busy sketching rose-tinted pictures of joy. In fancy, the
  5582	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tvoluptuous votary of fashion sees herself amid the festive throng, ‘the
  5583	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tobserved of all observers.’ Her graceful form, arrayed in snowy robes,
  5584	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tis whirling through the mazes of the joyous dance; her eye is brightest,
  5585	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ther step is lightest in the gay assembly.
  5586	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5587	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“In such delicious fancies time quickly glides by, and the welcome hour
  5588	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tarrives for her entrance into the Elysian world, of which she has
  5589	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thad such bright dreams. How fairy-like does everything appear to her
  5590	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tenchanted vision! Each new scene is more charming than the last. But
  5591	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tafter a while she finds that beneath this goodly exterior, all is
  5592	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tvanity, the flattery which once charmed her soul, now grates harshly
  5593	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tupon her ear; the ballroom has lost its charms; and with wasted health
  5594	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand imbittered heart, she turns away with the conviction that earthly
  5595	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpleasures cannot satisfy the longings of the soul!”
  5596	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5597	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd so forth and so on. There was a buzz of gratification from time to
  5598	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttime during the reading, accompanied by whispered ejaculations of “How
  5599	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsweet!” “How eloquent!” “So true!” etc., and after the thing had closed
  5600	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twith a peculiarly afflicting sermon the applause was enthusiastic.
  5601	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5602	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThen arose a slim, melancholy girl, whose face had the “interesting”
  5603	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t paleness that comes of pills and indigestion, and read a “poem.” Two
  5604	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstanzas of it will do:
  5605	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5606	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“A MISSOURI MAIDEN’S FAREWELL TO ALABAMA
  5607	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5608	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Alabama, goodbye! I love thee well! But yet for a while do I leave thee
  5609	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnow! Sad, yes, sad thoughts of thee my heart doth swell, And burning
  5610	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\trecollections throng my brow! For I have wandered through thy flowery
  5611	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twoods; Have roamed and read near Tallapoosa’s stream; Have listened to
  5612	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTallassee’s warring floods, And wooed on Coosa’s side Aurora’s beam.
  5613	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5614	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yet shame I not to bear an o’erfull heart, Nor blush to turn behind
  5615	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmy tearful eyes; ‘Tis from no stranger land I now must part, ‘Tis to no
  5616	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstrangers left I yield these sighs. Welcome and home were mine within
  5617	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthis State, Whose vales I leave--whose spires fade fast from me And cold
  5618	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmust be mine eyes, and heart, and tete, When, dear Alabama! they turn
  5619	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcold on thee!” There were very few there who knew what “tete” meant, but
  5620	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe poem was very satisfactory, nevertheless.
  5621	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5622	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tNext appeared a dark-complexioned, black-eyed, black-haired young lady,
  5623	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twho paused an impressive moment, assumed a tragic expression, and began
  5624	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto read in a measured, solemn tone:
  5625	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5626	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“A VISION
  5627	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5628	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Dark and tempestuous was night. Around the throne on high not a single
  5629	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstar quivered; but the deep intonations of the heavy thunder constantly
  5630	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tvibrated upon the ear; whilst the terrific lightning revelled in angry
  5631	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmood through the cloudy chambers of heaven, seeming to scorn the power
  5632	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\texerted over its terror by the illustrious Franklin! Even the boisterous
  5633	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twinds unanimously came forth from their mystic homes, and blustered
  5634	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tabout as if to enhance by their aid the wildness of the scene.
  5635	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5636	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“At such a time, so dark, so dreary, for human sympathy my very spirit
  5637	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsighed; but instead thereof,
  5638	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5639	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“‘My dearest friend, my counsellor, my comforter and guide--My joy in
  5640	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgrief, my second bliss in joy,’ came to my side. She moved like one of
  5641	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthose bright beings pictured in the sunny walks of fancy’s Eden by
  5642	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe romantic and young, a queen of beauty unadorned save by her own
  5643	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttranscendent loveliness. So soft was her step, it failed to make even a
  5644	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsound, and but for the magical thrill imparted by her genial touch,
  5645	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tas other unobtrusive beauties, she would have glided away
  5646	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tunperceived--unsought. A strange sadness rested upon her features, like
  5647	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ticy tears upon the robe of December, as she pointed to the contending
  5648	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\telements without, and bade me contemplate the two beings presented.”
  5649	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5650	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThis nightmare occupied some ten pages of manuscript and wound up with a
  5651	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsermon so destructive of all hope to non-Presbyterians that it took
  5652	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe first prize. This composition was considered to be the very finest
  5653	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\teffort of the evening. The mayor of the village, in delivering the prize
  5654	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto the author of it, made a warm speech in which he said that it was by
  5655	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfar the most “eloquent” thing he had ever listened to, and that Daniel
  5656	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tWebster himself might well be proud of it.
  5657	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5658	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tIt may be remarked, in passing, that the number of compositions in which
  5659	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe word “beauteous” was over-fondled, and human experience referred to
  5660	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tas “life’s page,” was up to the usual average.
  5661	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5662	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tNow the master, mellow almost to the verge of geniality, put his chair
  5663	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\taside, turned his back to the audience, and began to draw a map of
  5664	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAmerica on the blackboard, to exercise the geography class upon. But he
  5665	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmade a sad business of it with his unsteady hand, and a smothered titter
  5666	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\trippled over the house. He knew what the matter was, and set himself to
  5667	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tright it. He sponged out lines and remade them; but he only distorted
  5668	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthem more than ever, and the tittering was more pronounced. He threw his
  5669	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tentire attention upon his work, now, as if determined not to be put down
  5670	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tby the mirth. He felt that all eyes were fastened upon him; he imagined
  5671	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\the was succeeding, and yet the tittering continued; it even manifestly
  5672	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tincreased. And well it might. There was a garret above, pierced with
  5673	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta scuttle over his head; and down through this scuttle came a cat,
  5674	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsuspended around the haunches by a string; she had a rag tied about
  5675	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ther head and jaws to keep her from mewing; as she slowly descended she
  5676	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcurved upward and clawed at the string, she swung downward and clawed
  5677	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tat the intangible air. The tittering rose higher and higher--the cat was
  5678	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twithin six inches of the absorbed teacher’s head--down, down, a little
  5679	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlower, and she grabbed his wig with her desperate claws, clung to it,
  5680	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand was snatched up into the garret in an instant with her trophy still
  5681	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin her possession! And how the light did blaze abroad from the master’s
  5682	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbald pate--for the signpainter’s boy had _gilded_ it!
  5683	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5684	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThat broke up the meeting. The boys were avenged. Vacation had come.

  5694	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XXII
  5695	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5696	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTOM joined the new order of Cadets of Temperance, being attracted by the
  5697	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tshowy character of their “regalia.” He promised to abstain from smoking,
  5698	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tchewing, and profanity as long as he remained a member. Now he found out
  5699	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta new thing--namely, that to promise not to do a thing is the surest way
  5700	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin the world to make a body want to go and do that very thing. Tom soon
  5701	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfound himself tormented with a desire to drink and swear; the desire
  5702	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgrew to be so intense that nothing but the hope of a chance to display
  5703	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thimself in his red sash kept him from withdrawing from the order. Fourth
  5704	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof July was coming; but he soon gave that up--gave it up before he had
  5705	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tworn his shackles over forty-eight hours--and fixed his hopes upon old
  5706	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tJudge Frazer, justice of the peace, who was apparently on his deathbed
  5707	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand would have a big public funeral, since he was so high an official.
  5708	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tDuring three days Tom was deeply concerned about the Judge’s condition
  5709	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand hungry for news of it. Sometimes his hopes ran high--so high that
  5710	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\the would venture to get out his regalia and practise before the
  5711	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlooking-glass. But the Judge had a most discouraging way of fluctuating.
  5712	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAt last he was pronounced upon the mend--and then convalescent. Tom was
  5713	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdisgusted; and felt a sense of injury, too. He handed in his resignation
  5714	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tat once--and that night the Judge suffered a relapse and died. Tom
  5715	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tresolved that he would never trust a man like that again.
  5716	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5717	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe funeral was a fine thing. The Cadets paraded in a style calculated
  5718	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto kill the late member with envy. Tom was a free boy again,
  5719	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thowever--there was something in that. He could drink and swear, now--but
  5720	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfound to his surprise that he did not want to. The simple fact that he
  5721	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcould, took the desire away, and the charm of it.
  5722	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5723	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom presently wondered to find that his coveted vacation was beginning
  5724	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto hang a little heavily on his hands.
  5725	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5726	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHe attempted a diary--but nothing happened during three days, and so he
  5727	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tabandoned it.
  5728	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5729	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe first of all the negro minstrel shows came to town, and made a
  5730	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsensation. Tom and Joe Harper got up a band of performers and were happy
  5731	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfor two days.
  5732	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5733	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tEven the Glorious Fourth was in some sense a failure, for it rained
  5734	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thard, there was no procession in consequence, and the greatest man
  5735	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin the world (as Tom supposed), Mr. Benton, an actual United States
  5736	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tSenator, proved an overwhelming disappointment--for he was not
  5737	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttwenty-five feet high, nor even anywhere in the neighborhood of it.
  5738	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5739	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tA circus came. The boys played circus for three days afterward in tents
  5740	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmade of rag carpeting--admission, three pins for boys, two for girls--and
  5741	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthen circusing was abandoned.
  5742	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5743	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tA phrenologist and a mesmerizer came--and went again and left the village
  5744	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tduller and drearier than ever.
  5745	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5746	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThere were some boys-and-girls’ parties, but they were so few and so
  5747	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdelightful that they only made the aching voids between ache the harder.
  5748	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5749	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBecky Thatcher was gone to her Constantinople home to stay with her
  5750	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tparents during vacation--so there was no bright side to life anywhere.
  5751	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5752	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe dreadful secret of the murder was a chronic misery. It was a very
  5753	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcancer for permanency and pain.
  5754	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5755	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThen came the measles.
  5756	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5757	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tDuring two long weeks Tom lay a prisoner, dead to the world and its
  5758	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thappenings. He was very ill, he was interested in nothing. When he got
  5759	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tupon his feet at last and moved feebly downtown, a melancholy change had
  5760	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcome over everything and every creature. There had been a “revival,” and
  5761	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\teverybody had “got religion,” not only the adults, but even the boys and
  5762	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgirls. Tom went about, hoping against hope for the sight of one blessed
  5763	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsinful face, but disappointment crossed him everywhere. He found Joe
  5764	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHarper studying a Testament, and turned sadly away from the depressing
  5765	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tspectacle. He sought Ben Rogers, and found him visiting the poor with a
  5766	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbasket of tracts. He hunted up Jim Hollis, who called his attention to
  5767	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe precious blessing of his late measles as a warning. Every boy
  5768	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\the encountered added another ton to his depression; and when, in
  5769	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdesperation, he flew for refuge at last to the bosom of Huckleberry Finn
  5770	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand was received with a Scriptural quotation, his heart broke and he
  5771	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcrept home and to bed realizing that he alone of all the town was lost,
  5772	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tforever and forever.
  5773	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5774	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd that night there came on a terrific storm, with driving rain, awful
  5775	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tclaps of thunder and blinding sheets of lightning. He covered his head
  5776	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twith the bedclothes and waited in a horror of suspense for his doom; for
  5777	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\the had not the shadow of a doubt that all this hubbub was about him.
  5778	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHe believed he had taxed the forbearance of the powers above to the
  5779	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\textremity of endurance and that this was the result. It might have
  5780	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tseemed to him a waste of pomp and ammunition to kill a bug with a
  5781	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbattery of artillery, but there seemed nothing incongruous about the
  5782	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgetting up such an expensive thunderstorm as this to knock the turf from
  5783	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tunder an insect like himself.
  5784	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5785	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBy and by the tempest spent itself and died without accomplishing its
  5786	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tobject. The boy’s first impulse was to be grateful, and reform. His
  5787	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsecond was to wait--for there might not be any more storms.
  5788	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5789	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe next day the doctors were back; Tom had relapsed. The three weeks he
  5790	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tspent on his back this time seemed an entire age. When he got abroad
  5791	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tat last he was hardly grateful that he had been spared, remembering how
  5792	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlonely was his estate, how companionless and forlorn he was. He drifted
  5793	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlistlessly down the street and found Jim Hollis acting as judge in a
  5794	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tjuvenile court that was trying a cat for murder, in the presence of her
  5795	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tvictim, a bird. He found Joe Harper and Huck Finn up an alley eating a
  5796	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstolen melon. Poor lads! they--like Tom--had suffered a relapse.
  5797	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5798	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5799	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5800	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5801	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XXIII
  5802	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5803	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAT last the sleepy atmosphere was stirred--and vigorously: the murder
  5804	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttrial came on in the court. It became the absorbing topic of village
  5805	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttalk immediately. Tom could not get away from it. Every reference to
  5806	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe murder sent a shudder to his heart, for his troubled conscience
  5807	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand fears almost persuaded him that these remarks were put forth in
  5808	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\this hearing as “feelers”; he did not see how he could be suspected of
  5809	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tknowing anything about the murder, but still he could not be comfortable
  5810	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin the midst of this gossip. It kept him in a cold shiver all the time.
  5811	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHe took Huck to a lonely place to have a talk with him. It would be some
  5812	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\trelief to unseal his tongue for a little while; to divide his burden of
  5813	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdistress with another sufferer. Moreover, he wanted to assure himself
  5814	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat Huck had remained discreet.
  5815	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5816	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Huck, have you ever told anybody about--that?”
  5817	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5818	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“‘Bout what?”
  5819	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5820	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“You know what.”
  5821	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5822	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh--‘course I haven’t.”
  5823	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5824	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Never a word?”
  5825	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5826	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Never a solitary word, so help me. What makes you ask?”
  5827	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5828	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I was afeard.”
  5829	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5830	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, Tom Sawyer, we wouldn’t be alive two days if that got found out.
  5831	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t_You_ know that.”
  5832	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5833	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom felt more comfortable. After a pause:
  5834	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5835	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Huck, they couldn’t anybody get you to tell, could they?”
  5836	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5837	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Get me to tell? Why, if I wanted that halfbreed devil to drownd me they
  5838	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcould get me to tell. They ain’t no different way.”
  5839	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5840	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, that’s all right, then. I reckon we’re safe as long as we keep
  5841	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmum. But let’s swear again, anyway. It’s more surer.”
  5842	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5843	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’m agreed.”
  5844	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5845	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tSo they swore again with dread solemnities.
  5846	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5847	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“What is the talk around, Huck? I’ve heard a power of it.”
  5848	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5849	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Talk? Well, it’s just Muff Potter, Muff Potter, Muff Potter all the
  5850	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttime. It keeps me in a sweat, constant, so’s I want to hide som’ers.”
  5851	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5852	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“That’s just the same way they go on round me. I reckon he’s a goner.
  5853	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tDon’t you feel sorry for him, sometimes?”
  5854	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5855	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Most always--most always. He ain’t no account; but then he hain’t ever
  5856	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdone anything to hurt anybody. Just fishes a little, to get money to
  5857	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tget drunk on--and loafs around considerable; but lord, we all do
  5858	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat--leastways most of us--preachers and such like. But he’s kind of
  5859	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgood--he give me half a fish, once, when there warn’t enough for two; and
  5860	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlots of times he’s kind of stood by me when I was out of luck.”
  5861	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5862	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, he’s mended kites for me, Huck, and knitted hooks on to my line.
  5863	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tI wish we could get him out of there.”
  5864	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5865	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“My! we couldn’t get him out, Tom. And besides, ‘twouldn’t do any good;
  5866	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthey’d ketch him again.”
  5867	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5868	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes--so they would. But I hate to hear ‘em abuse him so like the dickens
  5869	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhen he never done--that.”
  5870	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5871	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I do too, Tom. Lord, I hear ‘em say he’s the bloodiest looking villain
  5872	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin this country, and they wonder he wasn’t ever hung before.”
  5873	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5874	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, they talk like that, all the time. I’ve heard ‘em say that if he
  5875	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas to get free they’d lynch him.”
  5876	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5877	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“And they’d do it, too.”
  5878	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5879	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe boys had a long talk, but it brought them little comfort. As the
  5880	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttwilight drew on, they found themselves hanging about the neighborhood
  5881	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof the little isolated jail, perhaps with an undefined hope that
  5882	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsomething would happen that might clear away their difficulties. But
  5883	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnothing happened; there seemed to be no angels or fairies interested in
  5884	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthis luckless captive.
  5885	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5886	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe boys did as they had often done before--went to the cell grating and
  5887	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgave Potter some tobacco and matches. He was on the ground floor and
  5888	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthere were no guards.
  5889	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5890	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHis gratitude for their gifts had always smote their consciences
  5891	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore--it cut deeper than ever, this time. They felt cowardly and
  5892	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttreacherous to the last degree when Potter said:
  5893	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5894	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“You’ve been mighty good to me, boys--better’n anybody else in this town.
  5895	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd I don’t forget it, I don’t. Often I says to myself, says I, ‘I used
  5896	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto mend all the boys’ kites and things, and show ‘em where the good
  5897	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfishin’ places was, and befriend ‘em what I could, and now they’ve
  5898	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tall forgot old Muff when he’s in trouble; but Tom don’t, and Huck
  5899	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdon’t--_they_ don’t forget him, says I, ‘and I don’t forget them.’ Well,
  5900	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tboys, I done an awful thing--drunk and crazy at the time--that’s the only
  5901	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tway I account for it--and now I got to swing for it, and it’s right.
  5902	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tRight, and _best_, too, I reckon--hope so, anyway. Well, we won’t talk
  5903	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tabout that. I don’t want to make _you_ feel bad; you’ve befriended me.
  5904	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBut what I want to say, is, don’t _you_ ever get drunk--then you won’t
  5905	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tever get here. Stand a litter furder west--so--that’s it; it’s a prime
  5906	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcomfort to see faces that’s friendly when a body’s in such a muck
  5907	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof trouble, and there don’t none come here but yourn. Good friendly
  5908	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfaces--good friendly faces. Git up on one another’s backs and let me
  5909	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttouch ‘em. That’s it. Shake hands--yourn’ll come through the bars, but
  5910	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmine’s too big. Little hands, and weak--but they’ve helped Muff Potter a
  5911	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpower, and they’d help him more if they could.”
  5912	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5913	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom went home miserable, and his dreams that night were full of horrors.
  5914	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe next day and the day after, he hung about the courtroom, drawn by an
  5915	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\talmost irresistible impulse to go in, but forcing himself to stay out.
  5916	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHuck was having the same experience. They studiously avoided each other.
  5917	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tEach wandered away, from time to time, but the same dismal fascination
  5918	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\talways brought them back presently. Tom kept his ears open when idlers
  5919	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsauntered out of the courtroom, but invariably heard distressing
  5920	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnews--the toils were closing more and more relentlessly around poor
  5921	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tPotter. At the end of the second day the village talk was to the effect
  5922	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat Injun Joe’s evidence stood firm and unshaken, and that there was
  5923	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnot the slightest question as to what the jury’s verdict would be.
  5924	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5925	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom was out late, that night, and came to bed through the window. He
  5926	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas in a tremendous state of excitement. It was hours before he got to
  5927	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsleep. All the village flocked to the courthouse the next morning, for
  5928	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthis was to be the great day. Both sexes were about equally represented
  5929	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin the packed audience. After a long wait the jury filed in and took
  5930	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttheir places; shortly afterward, Potter, pale and haggard, timid and
  5931	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thopeless, was brought in, with chains upon him, and seated where all
  5932	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe curious eyes could stare at him; no less conspicuous was Injun Joe,
  5933	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstolid as ever. There was another pause, and then the judge arrived and
  5934	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe sheriff proclaimed the opening of the court. The usual whisperings
  5935	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tamong the lawyers and gathering together of papers followed. These
  5936	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdetails and accompanying delays worked up an atmosphere of preparation
  5937	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat was as impressive as it was fascinating.
  5938	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5939	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tNow a witness was called who testified that he found Muff Potter washing
  5940	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin the brook, at an early hour of the morning that the murder was
  5941	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdiscovered, and that he immediately sneaked away. After some further
  5942	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tquestioning, counsel for the prosecution said:
  5943	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5944	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Take the witness.”
  5945	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5946	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe prisoner raised his eyes for a moment, but dropped them again when
  5947	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\this own counsel said:
  5948	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5949	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I have no questions to ask him.”
  5950	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5951	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe next witness proved the finding of the knife near the corpse.
  5952	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tCounsel for the prosecution said:
  5953	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5954	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Take the witness.”
  5955	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5956	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I have no questions to ask him,” Potter’s lawyer replied.
  5957	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5958	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tA third witness swore he had often seen the knife in Potter’s
  5959	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpossession.
  5960	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5961	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Take the witness.”
  5962	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5963	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tCounsel for Potter declined to question him. The faces of the audience
  5964	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbegan to betray annoyance. Did this attorney mean to throw away his
  5965	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tclient’s life without an effort?
  5966	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5967	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tSeveral witnesses deposed concerning Potter’s guilty behavior when
  5968	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbrought to the scene of the murder. They were allowed to leave the stand
  5969	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twithout being cross-questioned.
  5970	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5971	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tEvery detail of the damaging circumstances that occurred in the
  5972	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgraveyard upon that morning which all present remembered so well was
  5973	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbrought out by credible witnesses, but none of them were cross-examined
  5974	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tby Potter’s lawyer. The perplexity and dissatisfaction of the house
  5975	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\texpressed itself in murmurs and provoked a reproof from the bench.
  5976	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tCounsel for the prosecution now said:
  5977	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5978	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“By the oaths of citizens whose simple word is above suspicion, we have
  5979	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfastened this awful crime, beyond all possibility of question, upon the
  5980	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tunhappy prisoner at the bar. We rest our case here.”
  5981	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5982	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tA groan escaped from poor Potter, and he put his face in his hands and
  5983	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\trocked his body softly to and fro, while a painful silence reigned
  5984	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin the courtroom. Many men were moved, and many women’s compassion
  5985	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttestified itself in tears. Counsel for the defence rose and said:
  5986	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5987	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Your honor, in our remarks at the opening of this trial, we
  5988	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tforeshadowed our purpose to prove that our client did this fearful deed
  5989	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhile under the influence of a blind and irresponsible delirium produced
  5990	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tby drink. We have changed our mind. We shall not offer that plea.” [Then
  5991	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto the clerk:] “Call Thomas Sawyer!”
  5992	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5993	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tA puzzled amazement awoke in every face in the house, not even excepting
  5994	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tPotter’s. Every eye fastened itself with wondering interest upon Tom as
  5995	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\the rose and took his place upon the stand. The boy looked wild enough,
  5996	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfor he was badly scared. The oath was administered.
  5997	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  5998	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Thomas Sawyer, where were you on the seventeenth of June, about the
  5999	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thour of midnight?”
  6000	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6001	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom glanced at Injun Joe’s iron face and his tongue failed him. The
  6002	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\taudience listened breathless, but the words refused to come. After a few
  6003	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmoments, however, the boy got a little of his strength back, and managed
  6004	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto put enough of it into his voice to make part of the house hear:
  6005	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6006	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“In the graveyard!”
  6007	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6008	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“A little bit louder, please. Don’t be afraid. You were--”
  6009	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6010	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“In the graveyard.”
  6011	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6012	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tA contemptuous smile flitted across Injun Joe’s face.
  6013	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6014	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Were you anywhere near Horse Williams’ grave?”
  6015	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6016	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, sir.”
  6017	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6018	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Speak up--just a trifle louder. How near were you?”
  6019	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6020	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Near as I am to you.”
  6021	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6022	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Were you hidden, or not?”
  6023	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6024	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I was hid.”
  6025	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6026	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Where?”
  6027	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6028	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Behind the elms that’s on the edge of the grave.”
  6029	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6030	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tInjun Joe gave a barely perceptible start.
  6031	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6032	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Any one with you?”
  6033	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6034	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, sir. I went there with--”
  6035	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6036	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Wait--wait a moment. Never mind mentioning your companion’s name. We
  6037	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twill produce him at the proper time. Did you carry anything there with
  6038	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tyou.”
  6039	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6040	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom hesitated and looked confused.
  6041	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6042	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Speak out, my boy--don’t be diffident. The truth is always respectable.
  6043	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tWhat did you take there?”
  6044	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6045	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Only a--a--dead cat.”
  6046	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6047	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThere was a ripple of mirth, which the court checked.
  6048	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6049	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“We will produce the skeleton of that cat. Now, my boy, tell us
  6050	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\teverything that occurred--tell it in your own way--don’t skip anything,
  6051	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand don’t be afraid.”
  6052	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6053	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom began--hesitatingly at first, but as he warmed to his subject his
  6054	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twords flowed more and more easily; in a little while every sound ceased
  6055	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbut his own voice; every eye fixed itself upon him; with parted lips and
  6056	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbated breath the audience hung upon his words, taking no note of time,
  6057	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\trapt in the ghastly fascinations of the tale. The strain upon pent
  6058	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\temotion reached its climax when the boy said:
  6059	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6060	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“--and as the doctor fetched the board around and Muff Potter fell, Injun
  6061	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tJoe jumped with the knife and--”
  6062	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6063	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tCrash! Quick as lightning the halfbreed sprang for a window, tore his
  6064	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tway through all opposers, and was gone!
  6065	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6066	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6067	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6068	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6069	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XXIV
  6070	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6071	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTOM was a glittering hero once more--the pet of the old, the envy of the
  6072	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tyoung. His name even went into immortal print, for the village paper
  6073	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmagnified him. There were some that believed he would be President, yet,
  6074	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tif he escaped hanging.
  6075	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6076	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAs usual, the fickle, unreasoning world took Muff Potter to its bosom
  6077	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand fondled him as lavishly as it had abused him before. But that sort
  6078	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof conduct is to the world’s credit; therefore it is not well to find
  6079	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfault with it.
  6080	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6081	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom’s days were days of splendor and exultation to him, but his nights
  6082	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twere seasons of horror. Injun Joe infested all his dreams, and always
  6083	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twith doom in his eye. Hardly any temptation could persuade the boy
  6084	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto stir abroad after nightfall. Poor Huck was in the same state of
  6085	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twretchedness and terror, for Tom had told the whole story to the lawyer
  6086	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe night before the great day of the trial, and Huck was sore afraid
  6087	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat his share in the business might leak out, yet, notwithstanding
  6088	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tInjun Joe’s flight had saved him the suffering of testifying in court.
  6089	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe poor fellow had got the attorney to promise secrecy, but what of
  6090	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat? Since Tom’s harassed conscience had managed to drive him to the
  6091	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlawyer’s house by night and wring a dread tale from lips that had
  6092	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbeen sealed with the dismalest and most formidable of oaths, Huck’s
  6093	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tconfidence in the human race was wellnigh obliterated.
  6094	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6095	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tDaily Muff Potter’s gratitude made Tom glad he had spoken; but nightly
  6096	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\the wished he had sealed up his tongue.
  6097	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6098	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHalf the time Tom was afraid Injun Joe would never be captured; the
  6099	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tother half he was afraid he would be. He felt sure he never could draw a
  6100	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsafe breath again until that man was dead and he had seen the corpse.
  6101	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6102	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tRewards had been offered, the country had been scoured, but no Injun
  6103	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tJoe was found. One of those omniscient and aweinspiring marvels, a
  6104	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdetective, came up from St. Louis, moused around, shook his head, looked
  6105	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twise, and made that sort of astounding success which members of that
  6106	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcraft usually achieve. That is to say, he “found a clew.” But you can’t
  6107	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thang a “clew” for murder, and so after that detective had got through
  6108	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand gone home, Tom felt just as insecure as he was before.
  6109	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6110	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe slow days drifted on, and each left behind it a slightly lightened
  6111	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tweight of apprehension.
  6112	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6113	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t

  6116	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XXV
  6117	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6118	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTHERE comes a time in every rightly-constructed boy’s life when he has
  6119	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta raging desire to go somewhere and dig for hidden treasure. This desire
  6120	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsuddenly came upon Tom one day. He sallied out to find Joe Harper,
  6121	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbut failed of success. Next he sought Ben Rogers; he had gone fishing.
  6122	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tPresently he stumbled upon Huck Finn the Red-Handed. Huck would
  6123	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tanswer. Tom took him to a private place and opened the matter to him
  6124	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tconfidentially. Huck was willing. Huck was always willing to take a hand
  6125	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin any enterprise that offered entertainment and required no capital,
  6126	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfor he had a troublesome superabundance of that sort of time which is
  6127	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnot money. “Where’ll we dig?” said Huck.
  6128	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6129	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, most anywhere.”
  6130	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6131	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, is it hid all around?”
  6132	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6133	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, indeed it ain’t. It’s hid in mighty particular places,
  6134	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHuck--sometimes on islands, sometimes in rotten chests under the end of
  6135	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta limb of an old dead tree, just where the shadow falls at midnight; but
  6136	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmostly under the floor in ha’nted houses.”
  6137	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6138	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Who hides it?”
  6139	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6140	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, robbers, of course--who’d you reckon? Sunday-school
  6141	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsup’rintendents?”
  6142	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6143	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I don’t know. If ‘twas mine I wouldn’t hide it; I’d spend it and have a
  6144	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgood time.”
  6145	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6146	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“So would I. But robbers don’t do that way. They always hide it and
  6147	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tleave it there.”
  6148	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6149	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Don’t they come after it any more?”
  6150	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6151	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, they think they will, but they generally forget the marks, or else
  6152	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthey die. Anyway, it lays there a long time and gets rusty; and by and
  6153	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tby somebody finds an old yellow paper that tells how to find the marks--a
  6154	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpaper that’s got to be ciphered over about a week because it’s mostly
  6155	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsigns and hy’roglyphics.”
  6156	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6157	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hyro--which?”
  6158	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6159	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hy’roglyphics--pictures and things, you know, that don’t seem to mean
  6160	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tanything.”
  6161	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6162	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Have you got one of them papers, Tom?”
  6163	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6164	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No.”
  6165	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6166	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well then, how you going to find the marks?”
  6167	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6168	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I don’t want any marks. They always bury it under a ha’nted house or on
  6169	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tan island, or under a dead tree that’s got one limb sticking out. Well,
  6170	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twe’ve tried Jackson’s Island a little, and we can try it again some
  6171	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttime; and there’s the old ha’nted house up the Still-House branch, and
  6172	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthere’s lots of dead-limb trees--dead loads of ‘em.”
  6173	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6174	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Is it under all of them?”
  6175	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6176	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“How you talk! No!”
  6177	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6178	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Then how you going to know which one to go for?”
  6179	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6180	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Go for all of ‘em!”
  6181	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6182	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, Tom, it’ll take all summer.”
  6183	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6184	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, what of that? Suppose you find a brass pot with a hundred dollars
  6185	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin it, all rusty and gray, or rotten chest full of di’monds. How’s
  6186	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat?”
  6187	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6188	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHuck’s eyes glowed.
  6189	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6190	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“That’s bully. Plenty bully enough for me. Just you gimme the hundred
  6191	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdollars and I don’t want no di’monds.”
  6192	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6193	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right. But I bet you I ain’t going to throw off on di’monds. Some
  6194	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof ‘em’s worth twenty dollars apiece--there ain’t any, hardly, but’s
  6195	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tworth six bits or a dollar.”
  6196	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6197	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No! Is that so?”
  6198	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6199	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Cert’nly--anybody’ll tell you so. Hain’t you ever seen one, Huck?”
  6200	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6201	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Not as I remember.”
  6202	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6203	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, kings have slathers of them.”
  6204	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6205	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I don’ know no kings, Tom.”
  6206	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6207	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I reckon you don’t. But if you was to go to Europe you’d see a raft of
  6208	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t‘em hopping around.”
  6209	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6210	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Do they hop?”
  6211	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6212	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hop?--your granny! No!”
  6213	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6214	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, what did you say they did, for?”
  6215	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6216	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Shucks, I only meant you’d _see_ ‘em--not hopping, of course--what do
  6217	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthey want to hop for?--but I mean you’d just see ‘em--scattered around,
  6218	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tyou know, in a kind of a general way. Like that old humpbacked Richard.”
  6219	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6220	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Richard? What’s his other name?”
  6221	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6222	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“He didn’t have any other name. Kings don’t have any but a given name.”
  6223	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6224	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No?”
  6225	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6226	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“But they don’t.”
  6227	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6228	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, if they like it, Tom, all right; but I don’t want to be a king
  6229	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand have only just a given name, like a nigger. But say--where you going
  6230	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto dig first?”
  6231	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6232	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I don’t know. S’pose we tackle that old dead-limb tree on the
  6233	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thill t’other side of Still-House branch?”
  6234	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6235	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’m agreed.”
  6236	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6237	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tSo they got a crippled pick and a shovel, and set out on their
  6238	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthree-mile tramp. They arrived hot and panting, and threw themselves
  6239	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdown in the shade of a neighboring elm to rest and have a smoke.
  6240	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6241	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I like this,” said Tom.
  6242	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6243	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“So do I.”
  6244	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6245	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Say, Huck, if we find a treasure here, what you going to do with your
  6246	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tshare?”
  6247	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6248	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I’ll have pie and a glass of soda every day, and I’ll go to every
  6249	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcircus that comes along. I bet I’ll have a gay time.”
  6250	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6251	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, ain’t you going to save any of it?”
  6252	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6253	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Save it? What for?”
  6254	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6255	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, so as to have something to live on, by and by.”
  6256	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6257	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, that ain’t any use. Pap would come back to thish-yer town some day
  6258	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand get his claws on it if I didn’t hurry up, and I tell you he’d clean
  6259	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tit out pretty quick. What you going to do with yourn, Tom?”
  6260	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6261	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’m going to buy a new drum, and a sure’nough sword, and a red necktie
  6262	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand a bull pup, and get married.”
  6263	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6264	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Married!”
  6265	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6266	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“That’s it.”
  6267	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6268	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tom, you--why, you ain’t in your right mind.”
  6269	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6270	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Wait--you’ll see.”
  6271	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6272	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, that’s the foolishest thing you could do. Look at pap and my
  6273	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmother. Fight! Why, they used to fight all the time. I remember, mighty
  6274	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twell.”
  6275	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6276	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“That ain’t anything. The girl I’m going to marry won’t fight.”
  6277	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6278	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tom, I reckon they’re all alike. They’ll all comb a body. Now you
  6279	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbetter think ‘bout this awhile. I tell you you better. What’s the name
  6280	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof the gal?”
  6281	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6282	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“It ain’t a gal at all--it’s a girl.”
  6283	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6284	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s all the same, I reckon; some says gal, some says girl--both’s
  6285	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tright, like enough. Anyway, what’s her name, Tom?”
  6286	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6287	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’ll tell you some time--not now.”
  6288	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6289	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right--that’ll do. Only if you get married I’ll be more lonesomer
  6290	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthan ever.”
  6291	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6292	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No you won’t. You’ll come and live with me. Now stir out of this and
  6293	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twe’ll go to digging.”
  6294	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6295	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThey worked and sweated for half an hour. No result. They toiled another
  6296	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thalfhour. Still no result. Huck said:
  6297	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6298	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Do they always bury it as deep as this?”
  6299	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6300	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Sometimes--not always. Not generally. I reckon we haven’t got the right
  6301	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tplace.”
  6302	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6303	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tSo they chose a new spot and began again. The labor dragged a little,
  6304	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbut still they made progress. They pegged away in silence for some time.
  6305	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tFinally Huck leaned on his shovel, swabbed the beaded drops from his
  6306	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbrow with his sleeve, and said:
  6307	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6308	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Where you going to dig next, after we get this one?”
  6309	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6310	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I reckon maybe we’ll tackle the old tree that’s over yonder on Cardiff
  6311	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHill back of the widow’s.”
  6312	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6313	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I reckon that’ll be a good one. But won’t the widow take it away from
  6314	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tus, Tom? It’s on her land.”
  6315	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6316	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“_She_ take it away! Maybe she’d like to try it once. Whoever finds one
  6317	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof these hid treasures, it belongs to him. It don’t make any difference
  6318	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhose land it’s on.”
  6319	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6320	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThat was satisfactory. The work went on. By and by Huck said:
  6321	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6322	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Blame it, we must be in the wrong place again. What do you think?”
  6323	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6324	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“It is mighty curious, Huck. I don’t understand it. Sometimes witches
  6325	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tinterfere. I reckon maybe that’s what’s the trouble now.”
  6326	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6327	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Shucks! Witches ain’t got no power in the daytime.”
  6328	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6329	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, that’s so. I didn’t think of that. Oh, I know what the matter is!
  6330	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tWhat a blamed lot of fools we are! You got to find out where the shadow
  6331	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof the limb falls at midnight, and that’s where you dig!”
  6332	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6333	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Then consound it, we’ve fooled away all this work for nothing. Now hang
  6334	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tit all, we got to come back in the night. It’s an awful long way. Can
  6335	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tyou get out?”
  6336	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6337	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I bet I will. We’ve got to do it tonight, too, because if somebody sees
  6338	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthese holes they’ll know in a minute what’s here and they’ll go for it.”
  6339	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6340	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I’ll come around and maow tonight.”
  6341	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6342	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right. Let’s hide the tools in the bushes.”
  6343	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6344	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe boys were there that night, about the appointed time. They sat in
  6345	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe shadow waiting. It was a lonely place, and an hour made solemn by
  6346	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\told traditions. Spirits whispered in the rustling leaves, ghosts lurked
  6347	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin the murky nooks, the deep baying of a hound floated up out of the
  6348	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdistance, an owl answered with his sepulchral note. The boys were
  6349	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsubdued by these solemnities, and talked little. By and by they judged
  6350	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat twelve had come; they marked where the shadow fell, and began to
  6351	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdig. Their hopes commenced to rise. Their interest grew stronger, and
  6352	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttheir industry kept pace with it. The hole deepened and still deepened,
  6353	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbut every time their hearts jumped to hear the pick strike upon
  6354	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsomething, they only suffered a new disappointment. It was only a stone
  6355	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tor a chunk. At last Tom said:
  6356	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6357	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“It ain’t any use, Huck, we’re wrong again.”
  6358	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6359	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, but we _can’t_ be wrong. We spotted the shadder to a dot.”
  6360	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6361	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I know it, but then there’s another thing.”
  6362	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6363	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“What’s that?”.
  6364	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6365	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, we only guessed at the time. Like enough it was too late or too
  6366	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tearly.”
  6367	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6368	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHuck dropped his shovel.
  6369	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6370	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“That’s it,” said he. “That’s the very trouble. We got to give this one
  6371	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tup. We can’t ever tell the right time, and besides this kind of thing’s
  6372	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttoo awful, here this time of night with witches and ghosts a-fluttering
  6373	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\taround so. I feel as if something’s behind me all the time;  and I’m
  6374	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tafeard to turn around, becuz maybe there’s others in front a-waiting for
  6375	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta chance. I been creeping all over, ever since I got here.”
  6376	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6377	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I’ve been pretty much so, too, Huck. They most always put in a
  6378	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdead man when they bury a treasure under a tree, to look out for it.”
  6379	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6380	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Lordy!”
  6381	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6382	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, they do. I’ve always heard that.”
  6383	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6384	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tom, I don’t like to fool around much where there’s dead people. A
  6385	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbody’s bound to get into trouble with ‘em, sure.”
  6386	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6387	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I don’t like to stir ‘em up, either. S’pose this one here was to stick
  6388	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\this skull out and say something!”
  6389	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6390	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Don’t Tom! It’s awful.”
  6391	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6392	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, it just is. Huck, I don’t feel comfortable a bit.”
  6393	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6394	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Say, Tom, let’s give this place up, and try somewheres else.”
  6395	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6396	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right, I reckon we better.”
  6397	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6398	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“What’ll it be?”
  6399	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6400	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom considered awhile; and then said:
  6401	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6402	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“The ha’nted house. That’s it!”
  6403	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6404	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Blame it, I don’t like ha’nted houses, Tom. Why, they’re a dern sight
  6405	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tworse’n dead people. Dead people might talk, maybe, but they don’t come
  6406	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsliding around in a shroud, when you ain’t noticing, and peep over your
  6407	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tshoulder all of a sudden and grit their teeth, the way a ghost does. I
  6408	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcouldn’t stand such a thing as that, Tom--nobody could.”
  6409	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6410	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, but, Huck, ghosts don’t travel around only at night. They won’t
  6411	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thender us from digging there in the daytime.”
  6412	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6413	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, that’s so. But you know mighty well people don’t go about that
  6414	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tha’nted house in the day nor the night.”
  6415	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6416	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, that’s mostly because they don’t like to go where a man’s been
  6417	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmurdered, anyway--but nothing’s ever been seen around that house except
  6418	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin the night--just some blue lights slipping by the windows--no regular
  6419	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tghosts.”
  6420	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6421	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, where you see one of them blue lights flickering around, Tom,
  6422	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tyou can bet there’s a ghost mighty close behind it. It stands to reason.
  6423	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBecuz you know that they don’t anybody but ghosts use ‘em.”
  6424	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6425	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, that’s so. But anyway they don’t come around in the daytime, so
  6426	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhat’s the use of our being afeard?”
  6427	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6428	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, all right. We’ll tackle the ha’nted house if you say so--but I
  6429	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\treckon it’s taking chances.”
  6430	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6431	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThey had started down the hill by this time. There in the middle of the
  6432	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmoonlit valley below them stood the “ha’nted” house, utterly isolated,
  6433	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tits fences gone long ago, rank weeds smothering the very doorsteps, the
  6434	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tchimney crumbled to ruin, the window-sashes vacant, a corner of the roof
  6435	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcaved in. The boys gazed awhile, half expecting to see a blue light flit
  6436	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpast a window; then talking in a low tone, as befitted the time and the
  6437	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcircumstances, they struck far off to the right, to give the haunted
  6438	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thouse a wide berth, and took their way homeward through the woods that
  6439	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tadorned the rearward side of Cardiff Hill.
  6440	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6441	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6442	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6443	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6444	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XVI
  6445	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6446	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tABOUT noon the next day the boys arrived at the dead tree; they had come
  6447	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfor their tools. Tom was impatient to go to the haunted house; Huck was
  6448	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmeasurably so, also--but suddenly said:
  6449	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6450	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Lookyhere, Tom, do you know what day it is?”
  6451	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6452	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom mentally ran over the days of the week, and then quickly lifted his
  6453	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\teyes with a startled look in them--
  6454	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6455	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“My! I never once thought of it, Huck!”
  6456	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6457	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I didn’t neither, but all at once it popped onto me that it was
  6458	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tFriday.”
  6459	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6460	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Blame it, a body can’t be too careful, Huck. We might ‘a’ got into an
  6461	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tawful scrape, tackling such a thing on a Friday.”
  6462	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6463	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Might_! Better say we _would_! There’s some lucky days, maybe, but
  6464	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tFriday ain’t.”
  6465	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6466	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Any fool knows that. I don’t reckon _you_ was the first that found it
  6467	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tout, Huck.”
  6468	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6469	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I never said I was, did I? And Friday ain’t all, neither. I had a
  6470	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\trotten bad dream last night--dreampt about rats.”
  6471	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6472	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No! Sure sign of trouble. Did they fight?”
  6473	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6474	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No.”
  6475	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6476	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, that’s good, Huck. When they don’t fight it’s only a sign that
  6477	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthere’s trouble around, you know. All we got to do is to look mighty
  6478	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsharp and keep out of it. We’ll drop this thing for today, and play. Do
  6479	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tyou know Robin Hood, Huck?”
  6480	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6481	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No. Who’s Robin Hood?”
  6482	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6483	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, he was one of the greatest men that was ever in England--and the
  6484	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbest. He was a robber.”
  6485	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6486	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Cracky, I wisht I was. Who did he rob?”
  6487	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6488	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Only sheriffs and bishops and rich people and kings, and such like. But
  6489	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\the never bothered the poor. He loved ‘em. He always divided up with ‘em
  6490	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tperfectly square.”
  6491	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6492	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, he must ‘a’ been a brick.”
  6493	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6494	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I bet you he was, Huck. Oh, he was the noblest man that ever was.
  6495	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThey ain’t any such men now, I can tell you. He could lick any man in
  6496	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tEngland, with one hand tied behind him; and he could take his yew bow
  6497	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand plug a ten-cent piece every time, a mile and a half.”
  6498	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6499	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“What’s a _yew_ bow?”
  6500	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6501	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I don’t know. It’s some kind of a bow, of course. And if he hit that
  6502	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdime only on the edge he would set down and cry--and curse. But we’ll
  6503	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tplay Robin Hood--it’s nobby fun. I’ll learn you.”
  6504	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6505	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’m agreed.”
  6506	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6507	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tSo they played Robin Hood all the afternoon, now and then casting a
  6508	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tyearning eye down upon the haunted house and passing a remark about the
  6509	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmorrow’s prospects and possibilities there. As the sun began to sink
  6510	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tinto the west they took their way homeward athwart the long shadows
  6511	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof the trees and soon were buried from sight in the forests of Cardiff
  6512	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHill.
  6513	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6514	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tOn Saturday, shortly after noon, the boys were at the dead tree again.
  6515	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThey had a smoke and a chat in the shade, and then dug a little in their
  6516	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlast hole, not with great hope, but merely because Tom said there were
  6517	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tso many cases where people had given up a treasure after getting down
  6518	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twithin six inches of it, and then somebody else had come along and
  6519	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tturned it up with a single thrust of a shovel. The thing failed this
  6520	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttime, however, so the boys shouldered their tools and went away feeling
  6521	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat they had not trifled with fortune, but had fulfilled all the
  6522	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\trequirements that belong to the business of treasure-hunting.
  6523	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6524	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen they reached the haunted house there was something so weird and
  6525	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgrisly about the dead silence that reigned there under the baking sun,
  6526	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand something so depressing about the loneliness and desolation of the
  6527	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tplace, that they were afraid, for a moment, to venture in. Then they
  6528	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcrept to the door and took a trembling peep. They saw a weedgrown,
  6529	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfloorless room, unplastered, an ancient fireplace, vacant windows,
  6530	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta ruinous staircase; and here, there, and everywhere hung ragged and
  6531	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tabandoned cobwebs. They presently entered, softly, with quickened
  6532	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpulses, talking in whispers, ears alert to catch the slightest sound,
  6533	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand muscles tense and ready for instant retreat.
  6534	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6535	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tIn a little while familiarity modified their fears and they gave the
  6536	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tplace a critical and interested examination, rather admiring their own
  6537	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tboldness, and wondering at it, too. Next they wanted to look upstairs.
  6538	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThis was something like cutting off retreat, but they got to daring
  6539	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\teach other, and of course there could be but one result--they threw their
  6540	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttools into a corner and made the ascent. Up there were the same signs of
  6541	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdecay. In one corner they found a closet that promised mystery, but the
  6542	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpromise was a fraud--there was nothing in it. Their courage was up now
  6543	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand well in hand. They were about to go down and begin work when--
  6544	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6545	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Sh!” said Tom.
  6546	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6547	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“What is it?” whispered Huck, blanching with fright.
  6548	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6549	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Sh!... There!... Hear it?”
  6550	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6551	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes!... Oh, my! Let’s run!”
  6552	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6553	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Keep still! Don’t you budge! They’re coming right toward the door.”
  6554	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6555	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe boys stretched themselves upon the floor with their eyes to
  6556	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tknotholes in the planking, and lay waiting, in a misery of fear.
  6557	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6558	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“They’ve stopped.... No--coming.... Here they are. Don’t whisper another
  6559	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tword, Huck. My goodness, I wish I was out of this!”
  6560	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6561	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTwo men entered. Each boy said to himself: “There’s the old deaf and
  6562	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdumb Spaniard that’s been about town once or twice lately--never saw
  6563	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tt’other man before.”
  6564	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6565	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“T’other” was a ragged, unkempt creature, with nothing very pleasant
  6566	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin his face. The Spaniard was wrapped in a serape; he had bushy white
  6567	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhiskers; long white hair flowed from under his sombrero, and he wore
  6568	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgreen goggles. When they came in, “t’other” was talking in a low voice;
  6569	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthey sat down on the ground, facing the door, with their backs to the
  6570	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twall, and the speaker continued his remarks. His manner became less
  6571	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tguarded and his words more distinct as he proceeded:
  6572	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6573	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No,” said he, “I’ve thought it all over, and I don’t like it. It’s
  6574	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdangerous.”
  6575	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6576	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Dangerous!” grunted the “deaf and dumb” Spaniard--to the vast surprise
  6577	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof the boys. “Milksop!”
  6578	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6579	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThis voice made the boys gasp and quake. It was Injun Joe’s! There was
  6580	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsilence for some time. Then Joe said:
  6581	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6582	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“What’s any more dangerous than that job up yonder--but nothing’s come of
  6583	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tit.”
  6584	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6585	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“That’s different. Away up the river so, and not another house about.
  6586	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t‘Twon’t ever be known that we tried, anyway, long as we didn’t succeed.”
  6587	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6588	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, what’s more dangerous than coming here in the daytime!--anybody
  6589	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twould suspicion us that saw us.”
  6590	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6591	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I know that. But there warn’t any other place as handy after that fool
  6592	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof a job. I want to quit this shanty. I wanted to yesterday, only it
  6593	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twarn’t any use trying to stir out of here, with those infernal boys
  6594	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tplaying over there on the hill right in full view.”
  6595	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6596	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Those infernal boys” quaked again under the inspiration of this remark,
  6597	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand thought how lucky it was that they had remembered it was Friday and
  6598	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tconcluded to wait a day. They wished in their hearts they had waited a
  6599	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tyear.
  6600	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6601	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe two men got out some food and made a luncheon. After a long and
  6602	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthoughtful silence, Injun Joe said:
  6603	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6604	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Look here, lad--you go back up the river where you belong. Wait there
  6605	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttill you hear from me. I’ll take the chances on dropping into this town
  6606	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tjust once more, for a look. We’ll do that ‘dangerous’ job after I’ve
  6607	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tspied around a little and think things look well for it. Then for Texas!
  6608	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tWe’ll leg it together!”
  6609	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6610	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThis was satisfactory. Both men presently fell to yawning, and Injun Joe
  6611	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid:
  6612	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6613	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’m dead for sleep! It’s your turn to watch.”
  6614	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6615	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHe curled down in the weeds and soon began to snore. His comrade stirred
  6616	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thim once or twice and he became quiet. Presently the watcher began to
  6617	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnod; his head drooped lower and lower, both men began to snore now.
  6618	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6619	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe boys drew a long, grateful breath. Tom whispered:
  6620	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6621	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now’s our chance--come!”
  6622	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6623	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHuck said:
  6624	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6625	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I can’t--I’d die if they was to wake.”
  6626	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6627	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom urged--Huck held back. At last Tom rose slowly and softly, and
  6628	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstarted alone. But the first step he made wrung such a hideous creak
  6629	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfrom the crazy floor that he sank down almost dead with fright. He never
  6630	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmade a second attempt. The boys lay there counting the dragging moments
  6631	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttill it seemed to them that time must be done and eternity growing gray;
  6632	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand then they were grateful to note that at last the sun was setting.
  6633	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6634	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tNow one snore ceased. Injun Joe sat up, stared around--smiled grimly upon
  6635	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\this comrade, whose head was drooping upon his knees--stirred him up with
  6636	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\this foot and said:
  6637	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6638	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Here! _You’re_ a watchman, ain’t you! All right, though--nothing’s
  6639	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thappened.”
  6640	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6641	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“My! have I been asleep?”
  6642	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6643	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, partly, partly. Nearly time for us to be moving, pard. What’ll we
  6644	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdo with what little swag we’ve got left?”
  6645	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6646	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I don’t know--leave it here as we’ve always done, I reckon. No use to
  6647	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttake it away till we start south. Six hundred and fifty in silver’s
  6648	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsomething to carry.”
  6649	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6650	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well--all right--it won’t matter to come here once more.”
  6651	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6652	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No--but I’d say come in the night as we used to do--it’s better.”
  6653	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6654	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes: but look here; it may be a good while before I get the right
  6655	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tchance at that job; accidents might happen; ‘tain’t in such a very good
  6656	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tplace; we’ll just regularly bury it--and bury it deep.”
  6657	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6658	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Good idea,” said the comrade, who walked across the room, knelt down,
  6659	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\traised one of the rearward hearth-stones and took out a bag that jingled
  6660	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpleasantly. He subtracted from it twenty or thirty dollars for himself
  6661	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand as much for Injun Joe, and passed the bag to the latter, who was on
  6662	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\this knees in the corner, now, digging with his bowie-knife.
  6663	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6664	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe boys forgot all their fears, all their miseries in an instant. With
  6665	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgloating eyes they watched every movement. Luck!--the splendor of it was
  6666	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbeyond all imagination! Six hundred dollars was money enough to make
  6667	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thalf a dozen boys rich! Here was treasure-hunting under the happiest
  6668	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tauspices--there would not be any bothersome uncertainty as to where to
  6669	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdig. They nudged each other every moment--eloquent nudges and easily
  6670	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tunderstood, for they simply meant--“Oh, but ain’t you glad _now_ we’re
  6671	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\there!”
  6672	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6673	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tJoe’s knife struck upon something.
  6674	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6675	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hello!” said he.
  6676	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6677	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“What is it?” said his comrade.
  6678	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6679	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Half-rotten plank--no, it’s a box, I believe. Here--bear a hand and we’ll
  6680	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsee what it’s here for. Never mind, I’ve broke a hole.”
  6681	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6682	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHe reached his hand in and drew it out--
  6683	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6684	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Man, it’s money!”
  6685	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6686	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe two men examined the handful of coins. They were gold. The boys
  6687	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tabove were as excited as themselves, and as delighted.
  6688	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6689	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tJoe’s comrade said:
  6690	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6691	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“We’ll make quick work of this. There’s an old rusty pick over amongst
  6692	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe weeds in the corner the other side of the fireplace--I saw it a
  6693	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tminute ago.”
  6694	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6695	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHe ran and brought the boys’ pick and shovel. Injun Joe took the
  6696	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpick, looked it over critically, shook his head, muttered something to
  6697	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thimself, and then began to use it. The box was soon unearthed. It was
  6698	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnot very large; it was iron bound and had been very strong before the
  6699	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tslow years had injured it. The men contemplated the treasure awhile in
  6700	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tblissful silence.
  6701	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6702	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Pard, there’s thousands of dollars here,” said Injun Joe.
  6703	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6704	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“‘Twas always said that Murrel’s gang used to be around here one
  6705	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsummer,” the stranger observed.
  6706	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6707	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I know it,” said Injun Joe; “and this looks like it, I should say.”
  6708	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6709	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now you won’t need to do that job.”
  6710	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6711	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe halfbreed frowned. Said he:
  6712	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6713	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“You don’t know me. Least you don’t know all about that thing. ‘Tain’t
  6714	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\trobbery altogether--it’s _revenge_!” and a wicked light flamed in his
  6715	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\teyes. “I’ll need your help in it. When it’s finished--then Texas. Go home
  6716	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto your Nance and your kids, and stand by till you hear from me.”
  6717	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6718	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well--if you say so; what’ll we do with this--bury it again?”
  6719	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6720	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes. [Ravishing delight overhead.] _No_! by the great Sachem, no!
  6721	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t[Profound distress overhead.] I’d nearly forgot. That pick had fresh
  6722	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tearth on it! [The boys were sick with terror in a moment.] What business
  6723	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thas a pick and a shovel here? What business with fresh earth on
  6724	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthem? Who brought them here--and where are they gone? Have you heard
  6725	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tanybody?--seen anybody? What! bury it again and leave them to come and
  6726	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsee the ground disturbed? Not exactly--not exactly. We’ll take it to my
  6727	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tden.”
  6728	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6729	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, of course! Might have thought of that before. You mean Number
  6730	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tOne?”
  6731	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6732	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No--Number Two--under the cross. The other place is bad--too common.”
  6733	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6734	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right. It’s nearly dark enough to start.”
  6735	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6736	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tInjun Joe got up and went about from window to window cautiously peeping
  6737	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tout. Presently he said:
  6738	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6739	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Who could have brought those tools here? Do you reckon they can be
  6740	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tupstairs?”
  6741	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6742	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe boys’ breath forsook them. Injun Joe put his hand on his knife,
  6743	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thalted a moment, undecided, and then turned toward the stairway. The
  6744	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tboys thought of the closet, but their strength was gone. The steps came
  6745	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcreaking up the stairs--the intolerable distress of the situation woke
  6746	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe stricken resolution of the lads--they were about to spring for the
  6747	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcloset, when there was a crash of rotten timbers and Injun Joe landed on
  6748	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe ground amid the debris of the ruined stairway. He gathered himself
  6749	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tup cursing, and his comrade said:
  6750	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6751	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now what’s the use of all that? If it’s anybody, and they’re up there,
  6752	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlet them _stay_ there--who cares? If they want to jump down, now, and get
  6753	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tinto trouble, who objects? It will be dark in fifteen minutes--and then
  6754	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlet them follow us if they want to. I’m willing. In my opinion, whoever
  6755	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thove those things in here caught a sight of us and took us for ghosts or
  6756	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdevils or something. I’ll bet they’re running yet.”
  6757	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6758	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tJoe grumbled awhile; then he agreed with his friend that what daylight
  6759	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas left ought to be economized in getting things ready for leaving.
  6760	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tShortly afterward they slipped out of the house in the deepening
  6761	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttwilight, and moved toward the river with their precious box.
  6762	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6763	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom and Huck rose up, weak but vastly relieved, and stared after them
  6764	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthrough the chinks between the logs of the house. Follow? Not they. They
  6765	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twere content to reach ground again without broken necks, and take the
  6766	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttownward track over the hill. They did not talk much. They were too much
  6767	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tabsorbed in hating themselves--hating the ill luck that made them take
  6768	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe spade and the pick there. But for that, Injun Joe never would have
  6769	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsuspected. He would have hidden the silver with the gold to wait
  6770	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthere till his “revenge” was satisfied, and then he would have had the
  6771	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmisfortune to find that money turn up missing. Bitter, bitter luck that
  6772	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe tools were ever brought there!
  6773	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6774	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThey resolved to keep a lookout for that Spaniard when he should come to
  6775	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttown spying out for chances to do his revengeful job, and follow him to
  6776	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Number Two,” wherever that might be. Then a ghastly thought occurred to
  6777	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom.
  6778	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6779	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Revenge? What if he means _us_, Huck!”
  6780	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6781	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, don’t!” said Huck, nearly fainting.
  6782	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6783	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThey talked it all over, and as they entered town they agreed to believe
  6784	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat he might possibly mean somebody else--at least that he might at
  6785	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tleast mean nobody but Tom, since only Tom had testified.
  6786	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6787	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tVery, very small comfort it was to Tom to be alone in danger! Company
  6788	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twould be a palpable improvement, he thought.
  6789	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6790	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6791	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6792	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6793	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XXVII
  6794	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6795	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTHE adventure of the day mightily tormented Tom’s dreams that night.
  6796	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tFour times he had his hands on that rich treasure and four times
  6797	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tit wasted to nothingness in his fingers as sleep forsook him and
  6798	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twakefulness brought back the hard reality of his misfortune. As he lay
  6799	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin the early morning recalling the incidents of his great adventure, he
  6800	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnoticed that they seemed curiously subdued and far away--somewhat as if
  6801	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthey had happened in another world, or in a time long gone by. Then it
  6802	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\toccurred to him that the great adventure itself must be a dream! There
  6803	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas one very strong argument in favor of this idea--namely, that the
  6804	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tquantity of coin he had seen was too vast to be real. He had never seen
  6805	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tas much as fifty dollars in one mass before, and he was like all boys of
  6806	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\this age and station in life, in that he imagined that all references to
  6807	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“hundreds” and “thousands” were mere fanciful forms of speech, and that
  6808	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tno such sums really existed in the world. He never had supposed for
  6809	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta moment that so large a sum as a hundred dollars was to be found in
  6810	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tactual money in any one’s possession. If his notions of hidden treasure
  6811	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thad been analyzed, they would have been found to consist of a handful of
  6812	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\treal dimes and a bushel of vague, splendid, ungraspable dollars.
  6813	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6814	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBut the incidents of his adventure grew sensibly sharper and clearer
  6815	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tunder the attrition of thinking them over, and so he presently found
  6816	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thimself leaning to the impression that the thing might not have been a
  6817	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdream, after all. This uncertainty must be swept away. He would snatch a
  6818	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thurried breakfast and go and find Huck. Huck was sitting on the gunwale
  6819	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof a flatboat, listlessly dangling his feet in the water and looking
  6820	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tvery melancholy. Tom concluded to let Huck lead up to the subject. If
  6821	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\the did not do it, then the adventure would be proved to have been only a
  6822	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdream.
  6823	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6824	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hello, Huck!”
  6825	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6826	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hello, yourself.”
  6827	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6828	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tSilence, for a minute.
  6829	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6830	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tom, if we’d ‘a’ left the blame tools at the dead tree, we’d ‘a’ got
  6831	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe money. Oh, ain’t it awful!”
  6832	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6833	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“‘Tain’t a dream, then, ‘tain’t a dream! Somehow I most wish it was.
  6834	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tDog’d if I don’t, Huck.”
  6835	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6836	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“What ain’t a dream?”
  6837	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6838	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, that thing yesterday. I been half thinking it was.”
  6839	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6840	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Dream! If them stairs hadn’t broke down you’d ‘a’ seen how much dream
  6841	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tit was! I’ve had dreams enough all night--with that patch-eyed Spanish
  6842	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdevil going for me all through ‘em--rot him!”
  6843	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6844	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, not rot him. _Find_ him! Track the money!”
  6845	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6846	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tom, we’ll never find him. A feller don’t have only one chance for such
  6847	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta pile--and that one’s lost. I’d feel mighty shaky if I was to see him,
  6848	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tanyway.”
  6849	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6850	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, so’d I; but I’d like to see him, anyway--and track him out--to his
  6851	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tNumber Two.”
  6852	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6853	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Number Two--yes, that’s it. I been thinking ‘bout that. But I can’t make
  6854	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnothing out of it. What do you reckon it is?”
  6855	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6856	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I dono. It’s too deep. Say, Huck--maybe it’s the number of a house!”
  6857	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6858	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Goody!... No, Tom, that ain’t it. If it is, it ain’t in this one-horse
  6859	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttown. They ain’t no numbers here.”
  6860	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6861	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, that’s so. Lemme think a minute. Here--it’s the number of a
  6862	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\troom--in a tavern, you know!”
  6863	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6864	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, that’s the trick! They ain’t only two taverns. We can find out
  6865	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tquick.”
  6866	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6867	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“You stay here, Huck, till I come.”
  6868	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6869	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom was off at once. He did not care to have Huck’s company in public
  6870	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tplaces. He was gone half an hour. He found that in the best tavern, No.
  6871	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t2 had long been occupied by a young lawyer, and was still so occupied.
  6872	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tIn the less ostentatious house, No. 2 was a mystery. The tavern-keeper’s
  6873	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tyoung son said it was kept locked all the time, and he never saw anybody
  6874	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgo into it or come out of it except at night; he did not know any
  6875	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tparticular reason for this state of things; had had some little
  6876	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcuriosity, but it was rather feeble; had made the most of the mystery
  6877	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tby entertaining himself with the idea that that room was “ha’nted”; had
  6878	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnoticed that there was a light in there the night before.
  6879	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6880	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“That’s what I’ve found out, Huck. I reckon that’s the very No. 2 we’re
  6881	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tafter.”
  6882	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6883	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I reckon it is, Tom. Now what you going to do?”
  6884	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6885	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Lemme think.”
  6886	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6887	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom thought a long time. Then he said:
  6888	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6889	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’ll tell you. The back door of that No. 2 is the door that comes out
  6890	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tinto that little close alley between the tavern and the old rattle trap
  6891	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof a brick store. Now you get hold of all the doorkeys you can find, and
  6892	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tI’ll nip all of auntie’s, and the first dark night we’ll go there and
  6893	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttry ‘em. And mind you, keep a lookout for Injun Joe, because he said he
  6894	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas going to drop into town and spy around once more for a chance to get
  6895	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\this revenge. If you see him, you just follow him; and if he don’t go to
  6896	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat No. 2, that ain’t the place.”
  6897	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6898	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Lordy, I don’t want to foller him by myself!”
  6899	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6900	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, it’ll be night, sure. He mightn’t ever see you--and if he did,
  6901	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmaybe he’d never think anything.”
  6902	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6903	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, if it’s pretty dark I reckon I’ll track him. I dono--I dono. I’ll
  6904	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttry.”
  6905	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6906	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“You bet I’ll follow him, if it’s dark, Huck. Why, he might ‘a’ found
  6907	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tout he couldn’t get his revenge, and be going right after that money.”
  6908	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6909	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s so, Tom, it’s so. I’ll foller him; I will, by jingoes!”
  6910	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6911	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now you’re _talking_! Don’t you ever weaken, Huck, and I won’t.”
  6912	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6913	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t

  6916	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XXVIII
  6917	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6918	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTHAT night Tom and Huck were ready for their adventure. They hung about
  6919	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe neighborhood of the tavern until after nine, one watching the alley
  6920	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tat a distance and the other the tavern door. Nobody entered the alley or
  6921	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tleft it; nobody resembling the Spaniard entered or left the tavern
  6922	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdoor. The night promised to be a fair one; so Tom went home with the
  6923	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tunderstanding that if a considerable degree of darkness came on, Huck
  6924	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas to come and “maow,” whereupon he would slip out and try the keys.
  6925	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBut the night remained clear, and Huck closed his watch and retired to
  6926	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbed in an empty sugar hogshead about twelve.
  6927	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6928	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTuesday the boys had the same ill luck. Also Wednesday. But Thursday
  6929	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnight promised better. Tom slipped out in good season with his aunt’s
  6930	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\told tin lantern, and a large towel to blindfold it with. He hid the
  6931	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlantern in Huck’s sugar hogshead and the watch began. An hour before
  6932	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmidnight the tavern closed up and its lights (the only ones thereabouts)
  6933	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twere put out. No Spaniard had been seen. Nobody had entered or left the
  6934	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\talley. Everything was auspicious. The blackness of darkness reigned,
  6935	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe perfect stillness was interrupted only by occasional mutterings of
  6936	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdistant thunder.
  6937	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6938	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom got his lantern, lit it in the hogshead, wrapped it closely in the
  6939	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttowel, and the two adventurers crept in the gloom toward the tavern.
  6940	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHuck stood sentry and Tom felt his way into the alley. Then there was
  6941	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta season of waiting anxiety that weighed upon Huck’s spirits like a
  6942	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmountain. He began to wish he could see a flash from the lantern--it
  6943	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twould frighten him, but it would at least tell him that Tom was alive
  6944	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tyet. It seemed hours since Tom had disappeared. Surely he must have
  6945	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfainted; maybe he was dead; maybe his heart had burst under terror and
  6946	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\texcitement. In his uneasiness Huck found himself drawing closer
  6947	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand closer to the alley; fearing all sorts of dreadful things, and
  6948	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmomentarily expecting some catastrophe to happen that would take away
  6949	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\this breath. There was not much to take away, for he seemed only able to
  6950	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tinhale it by thimblefuls, and his heart would soon wear itself out, the
  6951	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tway it was beating. Suddenly there was a flash of light and Tom came
  6952	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttearing by him: “Run!” said he; “run, for your life!”
  6953	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6954	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHe needn’t have repeated it; once was enough; Huck was making thirty or
  6955	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tforty miles an hour before the repetition was uttered. The boys never
  6956	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstopped till they reached the shed of a deserted slaughter-house at the
  6957	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlower end of the village. Just as they got within its shelter the storm
  6958	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tburst and the rain poured down. As soon as Tom got his breath he said:
  6959	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6960	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Huck, it was awful! I tried two of the keys, just as soft as I could;
  6961	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbut they seemed to make such a power of racket that I couldn’t hardly
  6962	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tget my breath I was so scared. They wouldn’t turn in the lock, either.
  6963	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tWell, without noticing what I was doing, I took hold of the knob, and
  6964	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\topen comes the door! It warn’t locked! I hopped in, and shook off the
  6965	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttowel, and, _Great Caesar’s Ghost!_”
  6966	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6967	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“What!--what’d you see, Tom?”
  6968	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6969	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Huck, I most stepped onto Injun Joe’s hand!”
  6970	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6971	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No!”
  6972	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6973	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes! He was lying there, sound asleep on the floor, with his old patch
  6974	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ton his eye and his arms spread out.”
  6975	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6976	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Lordy, what did you do? Did he wake up?”
  6977	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6978	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, never budged. Drunk, I reckon. I just grabbed that towel and
  6979	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstarted!”
  6980	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6981	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’d never ‘a’ thought of the towel, I bet!”
  6982	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6983	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I would. My aunt would make me mighty sick if I lost it.”
  6984	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6985	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Say, Tom, did you see that box?”
  6986	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6987	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Huck, I didn’t wait to look around. I didn’t see the box, I didn’t see
  6988	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe cross. I didn’t see anything but a bottle and a tin cup on the floor
  6989	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tby Injun Joe; yes, I saw two barrels and lots more bottles in the room.
  6990	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tDon’t you see, now, what’s the matter with that ha’nted room?”
  6991	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6992	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“How?”
  6993	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6994	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, it’s ha’nted with whiskey! Maybe _all_ the Temperance Taverns have
  6995	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgot a ha’nted room, hey, Huck?”
  6996	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  6997	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I reckon maybe that’s so. Who’d ‘a’ thought such a thing? But
  6998	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsay, Tom, now’s a mighty good time to get that box, if Injun Joe’s
  6999	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdrunk.”
  7000	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7001	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“It is, that! You try it!”
  7002	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7003	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHuck shuddered.
  7004	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7005	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, no--I reckon not.”
  7006	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7007	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“And I reckon not, Huck. Only one bottle alongside of Injun Joe ain’t
  7008	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tenough. If there’d been three, he’d be drunk enough and I’d do it.”
  7009	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7010	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThere was a long pause for reflection, and then Tom said:
  7011	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7012	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Lookyhere, Huck, less not try that thing any more till we know Injun
  7013	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tJoe’s not in there. It’s too scary. Now, if we watch every night, we’ll
  7014	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbe dead sure to see him go out, some time or other, and then we’ll
  7015	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsnatch that box quicker’n lightning.”
  7016	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7017	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I’m agreed. I’ll watch the whole night long, and I’ll do it every
  7018	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnight, too, if you’ll do the other part of the job.”
  7019	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7020	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right, I will. All you got to do is to trot up Hooper Street a
  7021	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tblock and maow--and if I’m asleep, you throw some gravel at the window
  7022	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand that’ll fetch me.”
  7023	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7024	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Agreed, and good as wheat!”
  7025	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7026	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now, Huck, the storm’s over, and I’ll go home. It’ll begin to be
  7027	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdaylight in a couple of hours. You go back and watch that long, will
  7028	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tyou?”
  7029	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7030	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I said I would, Tom, and I will. I’ll ha’nt that tavern every night for
  7031	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta year! I’ll sleep all day and I’ll stand watch all night.”
  7032	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7033	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“That’s all right. Now, where you going to sleep?”
  7034	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7035	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“In Ben Rogers’ hayloft. He lets me, and so does his pap’s nigger man,
  7036	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tUncle Jake. I tote water for Uncle Jake whenever he wants me to, and any
  7037	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttime I ask him he gives me a little something to eat if he can spare it.
  7038	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThat’s a mighty good nigger, Tom. He likes me, becuz I don’t ever act as
  7039	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tif I was above him. Sometime I’ve set right down and eat _with_ him. But
  7040	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tyou needn’t tell that. A body’s got to do things when he’s awful hungry
  7041	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\the wouldn’t want to do as a steady thing.”
  7042	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7043	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, if I don’t want you in the daytime, I’ll let you sleep. I won’t
  7044	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcome bothering around. Any time you see something’s up, in the night,
  7045	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tjust skip right around and maow.”
  7046	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7047	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7048	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7049	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7050	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XXIX
  7051	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7052	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTHE first thing Tom heard on Friday morning was a glad piece of
  7053	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnews--Judge Thatcher’s family had come back to town the night before.
  7054	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBoth Injun Joe and the treasure sunk into secondary importance for a
  7055	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmoment, and Becky took the chief place in the boy’s interest. He saw her
  7056	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand they had an exhausting good time playing “hispy” and “gully-keeper”
  7057	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t with a crowd of their schoolmates. The day was completed and crowned in
  7058	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta peculiarly satisfactory way: Becky teased her mother to appoint
  7059	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe next day for the long-promised and long-delayed picnic, and she
  7060	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tconsented. The child’s delight was boundless; and Tom’s not more
  7061	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmoderate. The invitations were sent out before sunset, and straightway
  7062	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe young folks of the village were thrown into a fever of preparation
  7063	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand pleasurable anticipation. Tom’s excitement enabled him to keep
  7064	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tawake until a pretty late hour, and he had good hopes of hearing Huck’s
  7065	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“maow,” and of having his treasure to astonish Becky and the picnickers
  7066	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twith, next day; but he was disappointed. No signal came that night.
  7067	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7068	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tMorning came, eventually, and by ten or eleven o’clock a giddy and
  7069	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\trollicking company were gathered at Judge Thatcher’s, and everything was
  7070	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tready for a start. It was not the custom for elderly people to mar the
  7071	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpicnics with their presence. The children were considered safe enough
  7072	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tunder the wings of a few young ladies of eighteen and a few young
  7073	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgentlemen of twenty-three or thereabouts. The old steam ferry-boat was
  7074	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tchartered for the occasion; presently the gay throng filed up the main
  7075	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstreet laden with provision-baskets. Sid was sick and had to miss
  7076	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe fun; Mary remained at home to entertain him. The last thing Mrs.
  7077	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThatcher said to Becky, was:
  7078	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7079	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“You’ll not get back till late. Perhaps you’d better stay all night with
  7080	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsome of the girls that live near the ferry-landing, child.”
  7081	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7082	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Then I’ll stay with Susy Harper, mamma.”
  7083	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7084	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Very well. And mind and behave yourself and don’t be any trouble.”
  7085	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7086	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tPresently, as they tripped along, Tom said to Becky:
  7087	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7088	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Say--I’ll tell you what we’ll do. ‘Stead of going to Joe Harper’s we’ll
  7089	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tclimb right up the hill and stop at the Widow Douglas’. She’ll have
  7090	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tice-cream! She has it most every day--dead loads of it. And she’ll be
  7091	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tawful glad to have us.”
  7092	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7093	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, that will be fun!”
  7094	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7095	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThen Becky reflected a moment and said:
  7096	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7097	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“But what will mamma say?”
  7098	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7099	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“How’ll she ever know?”
  7100	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7101	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe girl turned the idea over in her mind, and said reluctantly:
  7102	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7103	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I reckon it’s wrong--but--”
  7104	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7105	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“But shucks! Your mother won’t know, and so what’s the harm? All she
  7106	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twants is that you’ll be safe; and I bet you she’d ‘a’ said go there if
  7107	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tshe’d ‘a’ thought of it. I know she would!”
  7108	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7109	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe Widow Douglas’ splendid hospitality was a tempting bait. It and
  7110	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom’s persuasions presently carried the day. So it was decided to say
  7111	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnothing to anybody about the night’s programme. Presently it occurred to
  7112	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom that maybe Huck might come this very night and give the signal. The
  7113	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthought took a deal of the spirit out of his anticipations. Still he
  7114	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcould not bear to give up the fun at Widow Douglas’. And why should he
  7115	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgive it up, he reasoned--the signal did not come the night before, so
  7116	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhy should it be any more likely to come tonight? The sure fun of the
  7117	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tevening outweighed the uncertain treasure; and, boy-like, he determined
  7118	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto yield to the stronger inclination and not allow himself to think of
  7119	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe box of money another time that day.
  7120	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7121	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThree miles below town the ferryboat stopped at the mouth of a woody
  7122	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thollow and tied up. The crowd swarmed ashore and soon the forest
  7123	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdistances and craggy heights echoed far and near with shoutings and
  7124	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlaughter. All the different ways of getting hot and tired were gone
  7125	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthrough with, and by-and-by the rovers straggled back to camp fortified
  7126	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twith responsible appetites, and then the destruction of the good things
  7127	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbegan. After the feast there was a refreshing season of rest and chat in
  7128	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe shade of spreading oaks. By-and-by somebody shouted:
  7129	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7130	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Who’s ready for the cave?”
  7131	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7132	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tEverybody was. Bundles of candles were procured, and straightway there
  7133	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas a general scamper up the hill. The mouth of the cave was up the
  7134	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thillside--an opening shaped like a letter A. Its massive oaken door stood
  7135	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tunbarred. Within was a small chamber, chilly as an icehouse, and walled
  7136	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tby Nature with solid limestone that was dewy with a cold sweat. It was
  7137	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tromantic and mysterious to stand here in the deep gloom and look out
  7138	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tupon the green valley shining in the sun. But the impressiveness of the
  7139	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsituation quickly wore off, and the romping began again. The moment
  7140	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta candle was lighted there was a general rush upon the owner of it; a
  7141	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstruggle and a gallant defence followed, but the candle was soon knocked
  7142	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdown or blown out, and then there was a glad clamor of laughter and a
  7143	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnew chase. But all things have an end. By-and-by the procession went
  7144	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfiling down the steep descent of the main avenue, the flickering rank of
  7145	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlights dimly revealing the lofty walls of rock almost to their point of
  7146	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tjunction sixty feet overhead. This main avenue was not more than
  7147	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\teight or ten feet wide. Every few steps other lofty and still narrower
  7148	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcrevices branched from it on either hand--for McDougal’s cave was but a
  7149	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tvast labyrinth of crooked aisles that ran into each other and out again
  7150	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand led nowhere. It was said that one might wander days and nights
  7151	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttogether through its intricate tangle of rifts and chasms, and never
  7152	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfind the end of the cave; and that he might go down, and down, and
  7153	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstill down, into the earth, and it was just the same--labyrinth under
  7154	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlabyrinth, and no end to any of them. No man “knew” the cave. That was
  7155	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tan impossible thing. Most of the young men knew a portion of it, and it
  7156	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas not customary to venture much beyond this known portion. Tom Sawyer
  7157	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tknew as much of the cave as any one.
  7158	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7159	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe procession moved along the main avenue some three-quarters of
  7160	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta mile, and then groups and couples began to slip aside into branch
  7161	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tavenues, fly along the dismal corridors, and take each other by surprise
  7162	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tat points where the corridors joined again. Parties were able to elude
  7163	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\teach other for the space of half an hour without going beyond the
  7164	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“known” ground.
  7165	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7166	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBy-and-by, one group after another came straggling back to the mouth
  7167	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof the cave, panting, hilarious, smeared from head to foot with tallow
  7168	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdrippings, daubed with clay, and entirely delighted with the success of
  7169	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe day. Then they were astonished to find that they had been taking
  7170	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tno note of time and that night was about at hand. The clanging bell had
  7171	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbeen calling for half an hour. However, this sort of close to the day’s
  7172	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tadventures was romantic and therefore satisfactory. When the ferryboat
  7173	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twith her wild freight pushed into the stream, nobody cared sixpence for
  7174	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe wasted time but the captain of the craft.
  7175	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7176	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHuck was already upon his watch when the ferryboat’s lights went
  7177	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tglinting past the wharf. He heard no noise on board, for the young
  7178	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpeople were as subdued and still as people usually are who are nearly
  7179	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttired to death. He wondered what boat it was, and why she did not
  7180	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstop at the wharf--and then he dropped her out of his mind and put his
  7181	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tattention upon his business. The night was growing cloudy and dark. Ten
  7182	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\to’clock came, and the noise of vehicles ceased, scattered lights began
  7183	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto wink out, all straggling foot-passengers disappeared, the village
  7184	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbetook itself to its slumbers and left the small watcher alone with the
  7185	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsilence and the ghosts. Eleven o’clock came, and the tavern lights were
  7186	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tput out; darkness everywhere, now. Huck waited what seemed a weary long
  7187	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttime, but nothing happened. His faith was weakening. Was there any use?
  7188	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tWas there really any use? Why not give it up and turn in?
  7189	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7190	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tA noise fell upon his ear. He was all attention in an instant. The alley
  7191	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdoor closed softly. He sprang to the corner of the brick store. The next
  7192	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmoment two men brushed by him, and one seemed to have something under
  7193	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\this arm. It must be that box! So they were going to remove the treasure.
  7194	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tWhy call Tom now? It would be absurd--the men would get away with the box
  7195	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand never be found again. No, he would stick to their wake and follow
  7196	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthem; he would trust to the darkness for security from discovery. So
  7197	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcommuning with himself, Huck stepped out and glided along behind the
  7198	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmen, cat-like, with bare feet, allowing them to keep just far enough
  7199	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tahead not to be invisible.
  7200	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7201	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThey moved up the river street three blocks, then turned to the left up
  7202	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta crossstreet. They went straight ahead, then, until they came to the
  7203	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpath that led up Cardiff Hill; this they took. They passed by the old
  7204	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tWelshman’s house, halfway up the hill, without hesitating, and still
  7205	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tclimbed upward. Good, thought Huck, they will bury it in the old quarry.
  7206	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBut they never stopped at the quarry. They passed on, up the summit.
  7207	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThey plunged into the narrow path between the tall sumach bushes, and
  7208	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twere at once hidden in the gloom. Huck closed up and shortened his
  7209	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdistance, now, for they would never be able to see him. He trotted along
  7210	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tawhile; then slackened his pace, fearing he was gaining too fast; moved
  7211	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ton a piece, then stopped altogether; listened; no sound; none, save that
  7212	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\the seemed to hear the beating of his own heart. The hooting of an
  7213	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\towl came over the hill--ominous sound! But no footsteps. Heavens, was
  7214	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\teverything lost! He was about to spring with winged feet, when a man
  7215	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcleared his throat not four feet from him! Huck’s heart shot into his
  7216	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthroat, but he swallowed it again; and then he stood there shaking as
  7217	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tif a dozen agues had taken charge of him at once, and so weak that he
  7218	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthought he must surely fall to the ground. He knew where he was. He
  7219	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tknew he was within five steps of the stile leading into Widow Douglas’
  7220	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgrounds. Very well, he thought, let them bury it there; it won’t be hard
  7221	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto find.
  7222	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7223	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tNow there was a voice--a very low voice--Injun Joe’s:
  7224	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7225	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Damn her, maybe she’s got company--there’s lights, late as it is.”
  7226	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7227	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I can’t see any.”
  7228	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7229	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThis was that stranger’s voice--the stranger of the haunted house. A
  7230	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdeadly chill went to Huck’s heart--this, then, was the “revenge” job! His
  7231	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthought was, to fly. Then he remembered that the Widow Douglas had been
  7232	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tkind to him more than once, and maybe these men were going to murder
  7233	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ther. He wished he dared venture to warn her; but he knew he didn’t
  7234	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdare--they might come and catch him. He thought all this and more in
  7235	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe moment that elapsed between the stranger’s remark and Injun Joe’s
  7236	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnext--which was--
  7237	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7238	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Because the bush is in your way. Now--this way--now you see, don’t you?”
  7239	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7240	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes. Well, there _is_ company there, I reckon. Better give it up.”
  7241	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7242	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Give it up, and I just leaving this country forever! Give it up and
  7243	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmaybe never have another chance. I tell you again, as I’ve told you
  7244	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore, I don’t care for her swag--you may have it. But her husband was
  7245	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\trough on me--many times he was rough on me--and mainly he was the justice
  7246	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof the peace that jugged me for a vagrant. And that ain’t all. It ain’t
  7247	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta millionth part of it! He had me _horsewhipped_!--horsewhipped in
  7248	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfront of the jail, like a nigger!--with all the town looking on!
  7249	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t_Horsewhipped_!--do you understand? He took advantage of me and died. But
  7250	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tI’ll take it out of _her_.”
  7251	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7252	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, don’t kill her! Don’t do that!”
  7253	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7254	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Kill? Who said anything about killing? I would kill _him_ if he was
  7255	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\there; but not her. When you want to get revenge on a woman you don’t
  7256	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tkill her--bosh! you go for her looks. You slit her nostrils--you notch her
  7257	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tears like a sow!”
  7258	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7259	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“By God, that’s--”
  7260	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7261	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Keep your opinion to yourself! It will be safest for you. I’ll tie her
  7262	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto the bed. If she bleeds to death, is that my fault? I’ll not cry, if
  7263	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tshe does. My friend, you’ll help me in this thing--for _my_ sake--that’s
  7264	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhy you’re here--I mightn’t be able alone. If you flinch, I’ll kill you.
  7265	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tDo you understand that? And if I have to kill you, I’ll kill her--and
  7266	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthen I reckon nobody’ll ever know much about who done this business.”
  7267	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7268	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, if it’s got to be done, let’s get at it. The quicker the
  7269	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbetter--I’m all in a shiver.”
  7270	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7271	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Do it _now_? And company there? Look here--I’ll get suspicious of you,
  7272	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfirst thing you know. No--we’ll wait till the lights are out--there’s no
  7273	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thurry.”
  7274	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7275	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHuck felt that a silence was going to ensue--a thing still more awful
  7276	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthan any amount of murderous talk; so he held his breath and stepped
  7277	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgingerly back; planted his foot carefully and firmly, after balancing,
  7278	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tone-legged, in a precarious way and almost toppling over, first on one
  7279	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tside and then on the other. He took another step back, with the same
  7280	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\telaboration and the same risks; then another and another, and--a twig
  7281	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsnapped under his foot! His breath stopped and he listened. There was no
  7282	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsound--the stillness was perfect. His gratitude was measureless. Now he
  7283	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tturned in his tracks, between the walls of sumach bushes--turned
  7284	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thimself as carefully as if he were a ship--and then stepped quickly but
  7285	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcautiously along. When he emerged at the quarry he felt secure, and
  7286	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tso he picked up his nimble heels and flew. Down, down he sped, till he
  7287	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\treached the Welshman’s. He banged at the door, and presently the heads
  7288	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof the old man and his two stalwart sons were thrust from windows.
  7289	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7290	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“What’s the row there? Who’s banging? What do you want?”
  7291	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7292	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Let me in--quick! I’ll tell everything.”
  7293	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7294	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, who are you?”
  7295	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7296	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Huckleberry Finn--quick, let me in!”
  7297	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7298	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Huckleberry Finn, indeed! It ain’t a name to open many doors, I judge!
  7299	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBut let him in, lads, and let’s see what’s the trouble.”
  7300	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7301	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Please don’t ever tell I told you,” were Huck’s first words when he got
  7302	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin. “Please don’t--I’d be killed, sure--but the widow’s been good friends
  7303	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto me sometimes, and I want to tell--I _will_ tell if you’ll promise you
  7304	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twon’t ever say it was me.”
  7305	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7306	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“By George, he _has_ got something to tell, or he wouldn’t act so!”
  7307	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t exclaimed the old man; “out with it and nobody here’ll ever tell, lad.”
  7308	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7309	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThree minutes later the old man and his sons, well armed, were up the
  7310	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thill, and just entering the sumach path on tiptoe, their weapons in
  7311	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttheir hands. Huck accompanied them no further. He hid behind a great
  7312	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbowlder and fell to listening. There was a lagging, anxious silence, and
  7313	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthen all of a sudden there was an explosion of firearms and a cry.
  7314	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7315	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHuck waited for no particulars. He sprang away and sped down the hill as
  7316	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfast as his legs could carry him.
  7317	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t

  7321	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XXX
  7322	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7323	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAS the earliest suspicion of dawn appeared on Sunday morning, Huck came
  7324	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgroping up the hill and rapped gently at the old Welshman’s door. The
  7325	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tinmates were asleep, but it was a sleep that was set on a hair-trigger,
  7326	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ton account of the exciting episode of the night. A call came from a
  7327	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twindow:
  7328	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7329	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Who’s there!”
  7330	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7331	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHuck’s scared voice answered in a low tone:
  7332	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7333	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Please let me in! It’s only Huck Finn!”
  7334	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7335	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s a name that can open this door night or day, lad!--and welcome!”
  7336	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7337	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThese were strange words to the vagabond boy’s ears, and the pleasantest
  7338	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\the had ever heard. He could not recollect that the closing word had ever
  7339	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbeen applied in his case before. The door was quickly unlocked, and he
  7340	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tentered. Huck was given a seat and the old man and his brace of tall
  7341	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsons speedily dressed themselves.
  7342	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7343	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now, my boy, I hope you’re good and hungry, because breakfast will be
  7344	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tready as soon as the sun’s up, and we’ll have a piping hot one, too--make
  7345	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tyourself easy about that! I and the boys hoped you’d turn up and stop
  7346	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\there last night.”
  7347	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7348	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I was awful scared,” said Huck, “and I run. I took out when the pistols
  7349	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twent off, and I didn’t stop for three mile. I’ve come now becuz I wanted
  7350	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto know about it, you know; and I come before daylight becuz I didn’t
  7351	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twant to run across them devils, even if they was dead.”
  7352	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7353	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, poor chap, you do look as if you’d had a hard night of it--but
  7354	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthere’s a bed here for you when you’ve had your breakfast. No, they
  7355	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tain’t dead, lad--we are sorry enough for that. You see we knew right
  7356	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhere to put our hands on them, by your description; so we crept along
  7357	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ton tiptoe till we got within fifteen feet of them--dark as a cellar that
  7358	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsumach path was--and just then I found I was going to sneeze. It was the
  7359	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmeanest kind of luck! I tried to keep it back, but no use--‘twas bound to
  7360	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcome, and it did come! I was in the lead with my pistol raised, and when
  7361	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe sneeze started those scoundrels a-rustling to get out of the path,
  7362	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tI sung out, ‘Fire boys!’ and blazed away at the place where the rustling
  7363	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas. So did the boys. But they were off in a jiffy, those villains, and
  7364	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twe after them, down through the woods. I judge we never touched them.
  7365	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThey fired a shot apiece as they started, but their bullets whizzed by
  7366	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand didn’t do us any harm. As soon as we lost the sound of their feet
  7367	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twe quit chasing, and went down and stirred up the constables. They got a
  7368	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tposse together, and went off to guard the river bank, and as soon as it
  7369	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tis light the sheriff and a gang are going to beat up the woods. My boys
  7370	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twill be with them presently. I wish we had some sort of description of
  7371	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthose rascals--‘twould help a good deal. But you couldn’t see what they
  7372	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twere like, in the dark, lad, I suppose?”
  7373	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7374	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh yes; I saw them downtown and follered them.”
  7375	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7376	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Splendid! Describe them--describe them, my boy!”
  7377	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7378	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“One’s the old deaf and dumb Spaniard that’s ben around here once or
  7379	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttwice, and t’other’s a mean-looking, ragged--”
  7380	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7381	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“That’s enough, lad, we know the men! Happened on them in the woods back
  7382	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof the widow’s one day, and they slunk away. Off with you, boys, and
  7383	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttell the sheriff--get your breakfast tomorrow morning!”
  7384	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7385	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe Welshman’s sons departed at once. As they were leaving the room Huck
  7386	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsprang up and exclaimed:
  7387	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7388	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, please don’t tell _any_body it was me that blowed on them! Oh,
  7389	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tplease!”
  7390	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7391	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right if you say it, Huck, but you ought to have the credit of what
  7392	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tyou did.”
  7393	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7394	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh no, no! Please don’t tell!”
  7395	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7396	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen the young men were gone, the old Welshman said:
  7397	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7398	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“They won’t tell--and I won’t. But why don’t you want it known?”
  7399	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7400	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHuck would not explain, further than to say that he already knew too
  7401	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmuch about one of those men and would not have the man know that he knew
  7402	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tanything against him for the whole world--he would be killed for knowing
  7403	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tit, sure.
  7404	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7405	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe old man promised secrecy once more, and said:
  7406	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7407	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“How did you come to follow these fellows, lad? Were they looking
  7408	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsuspicious?”
  7409	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7410	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHuck was silent while he framed a duly cautious reply. Then he said:
  7411	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7412	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, you see, I’m a kind of a hard lot,--least everybody says so, and
  7413	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tI don’t see nothing agin it--and sometimes I can’t sleep much, on account
  7414	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof thinking about it and sort of trying to strike out a new way of
  7415	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdoing. That was the way of it last night. I couldn’t sleep, and so I
  7416	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcome along upstreet ‘bout midnight, a-turning it all over, and when I
  7417	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgot to that old shackly brick store by the Temperance Tavern, I backed
  7418	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tup agin the wall to have another think. Well, just then along comes
  7419	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthese two chaps slipping along close by me, with something under their
  7420	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tarm, and I reckoned they’d stole it. One was a-smoking, and t’other one
  7421	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twanted a light; so they stopped right before me and the cigars lit up
  7422	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttheir faces and I see that the big one was the deaf and dumb Spaniard,
  7423	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tby his white whiskers and the patch on his eye, and t’other one was a
  7424	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\trusty, ragged-looking devil.”
  7425	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7426	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Could you see the rags by the light of the cigars?”
  7427	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7428	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThis staggered Huck for a moment. Then he said:
  7429	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7430	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I don’t know--but somehow it seems as if I did.”
  7431	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7432	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Then they went on, and you--”
  7433	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7434	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Follered ‘em--yes. That was it. I wanted to see what was up--they sneaked
  7435	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\talong so. I dogged ‘em to the widder’s stile, and stood in the dark and
  7436	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\theard the ragged one beg for the widder, and the Spaniard swear he’d
  7437	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tspile her looks just as I told you and your two--”
  7438	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7439	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“What! The _deaf and dumb_ man said all that!”
  7440	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7441	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHuck had made another terrible mistake! He was trying his best to keep
  7442	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe old man from getting the faintest hint of who the Spaniard might be,
  7443	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand yet his tongue seemed determined to get him into trouble in spite of
  7444	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tall he could do. He made several efforts to creep out of his scrape,
  7445	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbut the old man’s eye was upon him and he made blunder after blunder.
  7446	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tPresently the Welshman said:
  7447	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7448	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“My boy, don’t be afraid of me. I wouldn’t hurt a hair of your head for
  7449	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tall the world. No--I’d protect you--I’d protect you. This Spaniard is
  7450	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnot deaf and dumb; you’ve let that slip without intending it; you can’t
  7451	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcover that up now. You know something about that Spaniard that you want
  7452	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto keep dark. Now trust me--tell me what it is, and trust me--I won’t
  7453	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbetray you.”
  7454	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7455	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHuck looked into the old man’s honest eyes a moment, then bent over and
  7456	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhispered in his ear:
  7457	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7458	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“‘Tain’t a Spaniard--it’s Injun Joe!”
  7459	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7460	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe Welshman almost jumped out of his chair. In a moment he said:
  7461	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7462	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s all plain enough, now. When you talked about notching ears and
  7463	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tslitting noses I judged that that was your own embellishment, because
  7464	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhite men don’t take that sort of revenge. But an Injun! That’s a
  7465	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdifferent matter altogether.”
  7466	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7467	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tDuring breakfast the talk went on, and in the course of it the old man
  7468	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid that the last thing which he and his sons had done, before going
  7469	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto bed, was to get a lantern and examine the stile and its vicinity for
  7470	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmarks of blood. They found none, but captured a bulky bundle of--
  7471	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7472	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Of _what_?”
  7473	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7474	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tIf the words had been lightning they could not have leaped with a more
  7475	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstunning suddenness from Huck’s blanched lips. His eyes were staring
  7476	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twide, now, and his breath suspended--waiting for the answer. The Welshman
  7477	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstarted--stared in return--three seconds--five seconds--ten--then replied:
  7478	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7479	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Of burglar’s tools. Why, what’s the _matter_ with you?”
  7480	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7481	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHuck sank back, panting gently, but deeply, unutterably grateful. The
  7482	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tWelshman eyed him gravely, curiously--and presently said:
  7483	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7484	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, burglar’s tools. That appears to relieve you a good deal. But what
  7485	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdid give you that turn? What were _you_ expecting we’d found?”
  7486	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7487	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHuck was in a close place--the inquiring eye was upon him--he would have
  7488	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgiven anything for material for a plausible answer--nothing suggested
  7489	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\titself--the inquiring eye was boring deeper and deeper--a senseless
  7490	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\treply offered--there was no time to weigh it, so at a venture he uttered
  7491	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tit--feebly:
  7492	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7493	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Sunday-school books, maybe.”
  7494	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7495	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tPoor Huck was too distressed to smile, but the old man laughed loud and
  7496	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tjoyously, shook up the details of his anatomy from head to foot, and
  7497	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tended by saying that such a laugh was money in a-man’s pocket, because
  7498	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tit cut down the doctor’s bill like everything. Then he added:
  7499	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7500	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Poor old chap, you’re white and jaded--you ain’t well a bit--no wonder
  7501	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tyou’re a little flighty and off your balance. But you’ll come out of it.
  7502	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tRest and sleep will fetch you out all right, I hope.”
  7503	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7504	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHuck was irritated to think he had been such a goose and betrayed such
  7505	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta suspicious excitement, for he had dropped the idea that the parcel
  7506	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbrought from the tavern was the treasure, as soon as he had heard the
  7507	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttalk at the widow’s stile. He had only thought it was not the treasure,
  7508	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thowever--he had not known that it wasn’t--and so the suggestion of a
  7509	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcaptured bundle was too much for his self-possession. But on the whole
  7510	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\the felt glad the little episode had happened, for now he knew beyond all
  7511	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tquestion that that bundle was not _the_ bundle, and so his mind was
  7512	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tat rest and exceedingly comfortable. In fact, everything seemed to be
  7513	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdrifting just in the right direction, now; the treasure must be still
  7514	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin No. 2, the men would be captured and jailed that day, and he and
  7515	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom could seize the gold that night without any trouble or any fear of
  7516	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tinterruption.
  7517	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7518	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tJust as breakfast was completed there was a knock at the door. Huck
  7519	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tjumped for a hiding-place, for he had no mind to be connected even
  7520	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tremotely with the late event. The Welshman admitted several ladies and
  7521	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgentlemen, among them the Widow Douglas, and noticed that groups of
  7522	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcitizens were climbing up the hill--to stare at the stile. So the news
  7523	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thad spread. The Welshman had to tell the story of the night to the
  7524	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tvisitors. The widow’s gratitude for her preservation was outspoken.
  7525	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7526	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Don’t say a word about it, madam. There’s another that you’re more
  7527	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbeholden to than you are to me and my boys, maybe, but he don’t allow me
  7528	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto tell his name. We wouldn’t have been there but for him.”
  7529	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7530	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tOf course this excited a curiosity so vast that it almost belittled the
  7531	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmain matter--but the Welshman allowed it to eat into the vitals of his
  7532	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tvisitors, and through them be transmitted to the whole town, for he
  7533	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\trefused to part with his secret. When all else had been learned, the
  7534	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twidow said:
  7535	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7536	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I went to sleep reading in bed and slept straight through all that
  7537	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnoise. Why didn’t you come and wake me?”
  7538	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7539	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“We judged it warn’t worth while. Those fellows warn’t likely to come
  7540	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tagain--they hadn’t any tools left to work with, and what was the use of
  7541	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twaking you up and scaring you to death? My three negro men stood guard
  7542	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tat your house all the rest of the night. They’ve just come back.”
  7543	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7544	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tMore visitors came, and the story had to be told and retold for a couple
  7545	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof hours more.
  7546	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7547	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThere was no Sabbath-school during day-school vacation, but everybody
  7548	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas early at church. The stirring event was well canvassed. News came
  7549	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat not a sign of the two villains had been yet discovered. When the
  7550	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsermon was finished, Judge Thatcher’s wife dropped alongside of Mrs.
  7551	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHarper as she moved down the aisle with the crowd and said:

  7553	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Is my Becky going to sleep all day? I just expected she would be tired
  7554	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto death.”
  7555	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7556	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Your Becky?”
  7557	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7558	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes,” with a startled look--“didn’t she stay with you last night?”
  7559	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7560	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, no.”
  7561	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7562	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tMrs. Thatcher turned pale, and sank into a pew, just as Aunt Polly,
  7563	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttalking briskly with a friend, passed by. Aunt Polly said:
  7564	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7565	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Goodmorning, Mrs. Thatcher. Goodmorning, Mrs. Harper. I’ve got a boy
  7566	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat’s turned up missing. I reckon my Tom stayed at your house last
  7567	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnight--one of you. And now he’s afraid to come to church. I’ve got to
  7568	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsettle with him.”
  7569	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7570	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tMrs. Thatcher shook her head feebly and turned paler than ever.
  7571	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7572	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“He didn’t stay with us,” said Mrs. Harper, beginning to look uneasy. A
  7573	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmarked anxiety came into Aunt Polly’s face.
  7574	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7575	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Joe Harper, have you seen my Tom this morning?”
  7576	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7577	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No’m.”
  7578	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7579	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“When did you see him last?”
  7580	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7581	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tJoe tried to remember, but was not sure he could say. The people had
  7582	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstopped moving out of church. Whispers passed along, and a boding
  7583	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tuneasiness took possession of every countenance. Children were anxiously
  7584	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tquestioned, and young teachers. They all said they had not noticed
  7585	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhether Tom and Becky were on board the ferryboat on the homeward trip;
  7586	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tit was dark; no one thought of inquiring if any one was missing. One
  7587	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tyoung man finally blurted out his fear that they were still in the cave!
  7588	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tMrs. Thatcher swooned away. Aunt Polly fell to crying and wringing her
  7589	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thands.
  7590	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7591	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe alarm swept from lip to lip, from group to group, from street to
  7592	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstreet, and within five minutes the bells were wildly clanging and
  7593	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe whole town was up! The Cardiff Hill episode sank into instant
  7594	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tinsignificance, the burglars were forgotten, horses were saddled, skiffs
  7595	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twere manned, the ferryboat ordered out, and before the horror was half
  7596	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tan hour old, two hundred men were pouring down highroad and river toward
  7597	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe cave.
  7598	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7599	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAll the long afternoon the village seemed empty and dead. Many women
  7600	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tvisited Aunt Polly and Mrs. Thatcher and tried to comfort them. They
  7601	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcried with them, too, and that was still better than words. All the
  7602	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttedious night the town waited for news; but when the morning dawned at
  7603	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlast, all the word that came was, “Send more candles--and send food.”
  7604	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t Mrs. Thatcher was almost crazed; and Aunt Polly, also. Judge Thatcher
  7605	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsent messages of hope and encouragement from the cave, but they conveyed
  7606	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tno real cheer.
  7607	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7608	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe old Welshman came home toward daylight, spattered with
  7609	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcandle-grease, smeared with clay, and almost worn out. He found Huck
  7610	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstill in the bed that had been provided for him, and delirious with
  7611	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfever. The physicians were all at the cave, so the Widow Douglas came
  7612	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand took charge of the patient. She said she would do her best by him,
  7613	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbecause, whether he was good, bad, or indifferent, he was the Lord’s,
  7614	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand nothing that was the Lord’s was a thing to be neglected. The
  7615	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tWelshman said Huck had good spots in him, and the widow said:
  7616	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7617	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“You can depend on it. That’s the Lord’s mark. He don’t leave it off.
  7618	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHe never does. Puts it somewhere on every creature that comes from his
  7619	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thands.”
  7620	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7621	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tEarly in the forenoon parties of jaded men began to straggle into the
  7622	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tvillage, but the strongest of the citizens continued searching. All the
  7623	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnews that could be gained was that remotenesses of the cavern were being
  7624	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\transacked that had never been visited before; that every corner and
  7625	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcrevice was going to be thoroughly searched; that wherever one wandered
  7626	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthrough the maze of passages, lights were to be seen flitting hither
  7627	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand thither in the distance, and shoutings and pistol-shots sent their
  7628	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thollow reverberations to the ear down the sombre aisles. In one place,
  7629	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfar from the section usually traversed by tourists, the names “BECKY &
  7630	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTOM” had been found traced upon the rocky wall with candle-smoke, and
  7631	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnear at hand a grease-soiled bit of ribbon. Mrs. Thatcher recognized the
  7632	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tribbon and cried over it. She said it was the last relic she should ever
  7633	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thave of her child; and that no other memorial of her could ever be so
  7634	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tprecious, because this one parted latest from the living body before the
  7635	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tawful death came. Some said that now and then, in the cave, a far-away
  7636	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tspeck of light would glimmer, and then a glorious shout would burst
  7637	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tforth and a score of men go trooping down the echoing aisle--and then a
  7638	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsickening disappointment always followed; the children were not there;
  7639	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tit was only a searcher’s light.
  7640	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7641	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThree dreadful days and nights dragged their tedious hours along, and
  7642	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe village sank into a hopeless stupor. No one had heart for anything.
  7643	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe accidental discovery, just made, that the proprietor of the
  7644	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTemperance Tavern kept liquor on his premises, scarcely fluttered the
  7645	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpublic pulse, tremendous as the fact was. In a lucid interval, Huck
  7646	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfeebly led up to the subject of taverns, and finally asked--dimly
  7647	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdreading the worst--if anything had been discovered at the Temperance
  7648	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTavern since he had been ill.
  7649	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7650	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes,” said the widow.
  7651	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7652	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHuck started up in bed, wildeyed:
  7653	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7654	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“What? What was it?”
  7655	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7656	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Liquor!--and the place has been shut up. Lie down, child--what a turn you
  7657	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdid give me!”
  7658	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7659	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Only tell me just one thing--only just one--please! Was it Tom Sawyer
  7660	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat found it?”
  7661	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7662	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe widow burst into tears. “Hush, hush, child, hush! I’ve told you
  7663	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore, you must _not_ talk. You are very, very sick!”
  7664	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7665	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThen nothing but liquor had been found; there would have been a great
  7666	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpowwow if it had been the gold. So the treasure was gone forever--gone
  7667	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tforever! But what could she be crying about? Curious that she should
  7668	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcry.
  7669	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7670	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThese thoughts worked their dim way through Huck’s mind, and under the
  7671	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tweariness they gave him he fell asleep. The widow said to herself:
  7672	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7673	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“There--he’s asleep, poor wreck. Tom Sawyer find it! Pity but somebody
  7674	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcould find Tom Sawyer! Ah, there ain’t many left, now, that’s got hope
  7675	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tenough, or strength enough, either, to go on searching.”
  7676	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7677	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7678	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7679	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7680	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XXXI
  7681	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7682	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tNOW to return to Tom and Becky’s share in the picnic. They tripped along
  7683	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe murky aisles with the rest of the company, visiting the familiar
  7684	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twonders of the cave--wonders dubbed with rather over-descriptive names,
  7685	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsuch as “The Drawing-Room,” “The Cathedral,” “Aladdin’s Palace,” and
  7686	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tso on. Presently the hide-and-seek frolicking began, and Tom and Becky
  7687	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tengaged in it with zeal until the exertion began to grow a trifle
  7688	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twearisome; then they wandered down a sinuous avenue holding their
  7689	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcandles aloft and reading the tangled webwork of names, dates,
  7690	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpostoffice addresses, and mottoes with which the rocky walls had been
  7691	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfrescoed (in candle-smoke). Still drifting along and talking, they
  7692	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tscarcely noticed that they were now in a part of the cave whose walls
  7693	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twere not frescoed. They smoked their own names under an overhanging
  7694	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tshelf and moved on. Presently they came to a place where a little stream
  7695	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof water, trickling over a ledge and carrying a limestone sediment with
  7696	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tit, had, in the slow-dragging ages, formed a laced and ruffled Niagara
  7697	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin gleaming and imperishable stone. Tom squeezed his small body behind
  7698	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tit in order to illuminate it for Becky’s gratification. He found that
  7699	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tit curtained a sort of steep natural stairway which was enclosed between
  7700	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnarrow walls, and at once the ambition to be a discoverer seized him.
  7701	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7702	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBecky responded to his call, and they made a smoke-mark for future
  7703	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tguidance, and started upon their quest. They wound this way and that,
  7704	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfar down into the secret depths of the cave, made another mark, and
  7705	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbranched off in search of novelties to tell the upper world about. In
  7706	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tone place they found a spacious cavern, from whose ceiling depended a
  7707	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmultitude of shining stalactites of the length and circumference of
  7708	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta man’s leg; they walked all about it, wondering and admiring, and
  7709	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpresently left it by one of the numerous passages that opened into
  7710	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tit. This shortly brought them to a bewitching spring, whose basin was
  7711	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tincrusted with a frostwork of glittering crystals; it was in the midst
  7712	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof a cavern whose walls were supported by many fantastic pillars which
  7713	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thad been formed by the joining of great stalactites and stalagmites
  7714	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttogether, the result of the ceaseless water-drip of centuries. Under the
  7715	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\troof vast knots of bats had packed themselves together, thousands in a
  7716	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbunch; the lights disturbed the creatures and they came flocking down by
  7717	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thundreds, squeaking and darting furiously at the candles. Tom knew their
  7718	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tways and the danger of this sort of conduct. He seized Becky’s hand and
  7719	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thurried her into the first corridor that offered; and none too soon, for
  7720	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta bat struck Becky’s light out with its wing while she was passing out
  7721	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof the cavern. The bats chased the children a good distance; but the
  7722	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfugitives plunged into every new passage that offered, and at last got
  7723	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\trid of the perilous things. Tom found a subterranean lake, shortly,
  7724	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhich stretched its dim length away until its shape was lost in the
  7725	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tshadows. He wanted to explore its borders, but concluded that it would
  7726	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbe best to sit down and rest awhile, first. Now, for the first time, the
  7727	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdeep stillness of the place laid a clammy hand upon the spirits of the
  7728	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tchildren. Becky said:
  7729	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7730	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, I didn’t notice, but it seems ever so long since I heard any of
  7731	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe others.”
  7732	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7733	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Come to think, Becky, we are away down below them--and I don’t know how
  7734	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfar away north, or south, or east, or whichever it is. We couldn’t hear
  7735	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthem here.”
  7736	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7737	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBecky grew apprehensive.
  7738	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7739	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I wonder how long we’ve been down here, Tom? We better start back.”
  7740	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7741	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, I reckon we better. P’raps we better.”
  7742	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7743	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Can you find the way, Tom? It’s all a mixed-up crookedness to me.”
  7744	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7745	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I reckon I could find it--but then the bats. If they put our candles
  7746	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tout it will be an awful fix. Let’s try some other way, so as not to go
  7747	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthrough there.”
  7748	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7749	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well. But I hope we won’t get lost. It would be so awful!” and the girl
  7750	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tshuddered at the thought of the dreadful possibilities.
  7751	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7752	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThey started through a corridor, and traversed it in silence a long
  7753	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tway, glancing at each new opening, to see if there was anything familiar
  7754	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tabout the look of it; but they were all strange. Every time Tom made an
  7755	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\texamination, Becky would watch his face for an encouraging sign, and he
  7756	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twould say cheerily:
  7757	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7758	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, it’s all right. This ain’t the one, but we’ll come to it right
  7759	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\taway!”
  7760	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7761	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBut he felt less and less hopeful with each failure, and presently began
  7762	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto turn off into diverging avenues at sheer random, in desperate hope of
  7763	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfinding the one that was wanted. He still said it was “all right,” but
  7764	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthere was such a leaden dread at his heart that the words had lost their
  7765	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tring and sounded just as if he had said, “All is lost!” Becky clung to
  7766	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\this side in an anguish of fear, and tried hard to keep back the tears,
  7767	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbut they would come. At last she said:
  7768	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7769	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, Tom, never mind the bats, let’s go back that way! We seem to get
  7770	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tworse and worse off all the time.”
  7771	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7772	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Listen!” said he.
  7773	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7774	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tProfound silence; silence so deep that even their breathings were
  7775	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tconspicuous in the hush. Tom shouted. The call went echoing down
  7776	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe empty aisles and died out in the distance in a faint sound that
  7777	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tresembled a ripple of mocking laughter.
  7778	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7779	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, don’t do it again, Tom, it is too horrid,” said Becky.
  7780	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7781	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“It is horrid, but I better, Becky; they might hear us, you know,” and
  7782	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\the shouted again.
  7783	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7784	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe “might” was even a chillier horror than the ghostly laughter, it so
  7785	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tconfessed a perishing hope. The children stood still and listened; but
  7786	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthere was no result. Tom turned upon the back track at once, and hurried
  7787	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\this steps. It was but a little while before a certain indecision in his
  7788	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmanner revealed another fearful fact to Becky--he could not find his way
  7789	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tback!
  7790	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7791	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, Tom, you didn’t make any marks!”
  7792	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7793	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Becky, I was such a fool! Such a fool! I never thought we might want to
  7794	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcome back! No--I can’t find the way. It’s all mixed up.”
  7795	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7796	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tom, Tom, we’re lost! we’re lost! We never can get out of this awful
  7797	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tplace! Oh, why _did_ we ever leave the others!”
  7798	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7799	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tShe sank to the ground and burst into such a frenzy of crying that Tom
  7800	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas appalled with the idea that she might die, or lose her reason. He
  7801	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsat down by her and put his arms around her; she buried her face in
  7802	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\this bosom, she clung to him, she poured out her terrors, her unavailing
  7803	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tregrets, and the far echoes turned them all to jeering laughter. Tom
  7804	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbegged her to pluck up hope again, and she said she could not. He fell
  7805	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto blaming and abusing himself for getting her into this miserable
  7806	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsituation; this had a better effect. She said she would try to hope
  7807	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tagain, she would get up and follow wherever he might lead if only he
  7808	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twould not talk like that any more. For he was no more to blame than she,
  7809	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tshe said.
  7810	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7811	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tSo they moved on again--aimlessly--simply at random--all they could do
  7812	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas to move, keep moving. For a little while, hope made a show of
  7813	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\treviving--not with any reason to back it, but only because it is its
  7814	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnature to revive when the spring has not been taken out of it by age and
  7815	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfamiliarity with failure.
  7816	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7817	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBy-and-by Tom took Becky’s candle and blew it out. This economy meant so
  7818	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmuch! Words were not needed. Becky understood, and her hope died again.
  7819	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tShe knew that Tom had a whole candle and three or four pieces in his
  7820	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpockets--yet he must economize.
  7821	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7822	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBy-and-by, fatigue began to assert its claims; the children tried to pay
  7823	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tattention, for it was dreadful to think of sitting down when time was
  7824	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgrown to be so precious, moving, in some direction, in any direction,
  7825	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas at least progress and might bear fruit; but to sit down was to
  7826	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tinvite death and shorten its pursuit.
  7827	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7828	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAt last Becky’s frail limbs refused to carry her farther. She sat down.
  7829	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom rested with her, and they talked of home, and the friends there,
  7830	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand the comfortable beds and, above all, the light! Becky cried, and Tom
  7831	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttried to think of some way of comforting her, but all his encouragements
  7832	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twere grown thread-bare with use, and sounded like sarcasms. Fatigue bore
  7833	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tso heavily upon Becky that she drowsed off to sleep. Tom was grateful.
  7834	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHe sat looking into her drawn face and saw it grow smooth and natural
  7835	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tunder the influence of pleasant dreams; and by-and-by a smile dawned and
  7836	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\trested there. The peaceful face reflected somewhat of peace and healing
  7837	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tinto his own spirit, and his thoughts wandered away to bygone times and
  7838	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdreamy memories. While he was deep in his musings, Becky woke up with a
  7839	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbreezy little laugh--but it was stricken dead upon her lips, and a groan
  7840	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfollowed it.
  7841	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7842	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, how _could_ I sleep! I wish I never, never had waked! No! No, I
  7843	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdon’t, Tom! Don’t look so! I won’t say it again.”
  7844	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7845	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I’m glad you’ve slept, Becky; you’ll feel rested, now, and we’ll find
  7846	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe way out.”
  7847	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7848	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“We can try, Tom; but I’ve seen such a beautiful country in my dream. I
  7849	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\treckon we are going there.”
  7850	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7851	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Maybe not, maybe not. Cheer up, Becky, and let’s go on trying.”
  7852	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7853	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThey rose up and wandered along, hand in hand and hopeless. They tried
  7854	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto estimate how long they had been in the cave, but all they knew was
  7855	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat it seemed days and weeks, and yet it was plain that this could not
  7856	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbe, for their candles were not gone yet. A long time after this--they
  7857	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcould not tell how long--Tom said they must go softly and listen for
  7858	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdripping water--they must find a spring. They found one presently, and
  7859	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom said it was time to rest again. Both were cruelly tired, yet Becky
  7860	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid she thought she could go a little farther. She was surprised to
  7861	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thear Tom dissent. She could not understand it. They sat down, and Tom
  7862	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfastened his candle to the wall in front of them with some clay. Thought
  7863	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas soon busy; nothing was said for some time. Then Becky broke the
  7864	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsilence:
  7865	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7866	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tom, I am so hungry!”
  7867	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7868	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom took something out of his pocket.
  7869	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7870	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Do you remember this?” said he.
  7871	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7872	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBecky almost smiled.
  7873	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7874	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s our wedding-cake, Tom.”
  7875	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7876	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes--I wish it was as big as a barrel, for it’s all we’ve got.”
  7877	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7878	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I saved it from the picnic for us to dream on, Tom, the way grownup
  7879	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpeople do with wedding-cake--but it’ll be our--”
  7880	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7881	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tShe dropped the sentence where it was. Tom divided the cake and Becky
  7882	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tate with good appetite, while Tom nibbled at his moiety. There was
  7883	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tabundance of cold water to finish the feast with. By-and-by Becky
  7884	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsuggested that they move on again. Tom was silent a moment. Then he
  7885	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid:
  7886	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7887	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Becky, can you bear it if I tell you something?”
  7888	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7889	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBecky’s face paled, but she thought she could.
  7890	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7891	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, then, Becky, we must stay here, where there’s water to drink.
  7892	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThat little piece is our last candle!”
  7893	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7894	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBecky gave loose to tears and wailings. Tom did what he could to comfort
  7895	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ther, but with little effect. At length Becky said:
  7896	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7897	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tom!”
  7898	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7899	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, Becky?”
  7900	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7901	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“They’ll miss us and hunt for us!”
  7902	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7903	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, they will! Certainly they will!”
  7904	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7905	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Maybe they’re hunting for us now, Tom.”
  7906	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7907	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, I reckon maybe they are. I hope they are.”
  7908	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7909	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“When would they miss us, Tom?”
  7910	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7911	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“When they get back to the boat, I reckon.”
  7912	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7913	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tom, it might be dark then--would they notice we hadn’t come?”
  7914	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7915	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I don’t know. But anyway, your mother would miss you as soon as they
  7916	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgot home.”
  7917	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7918	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tA frightened look in Becky’s face brought Tom to his senses and he saw
  7919	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat he had made a blunder. Becky was not to have gone home that night!
  7920	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe children became silent and thoughtful. In a moment a new burst of
  7921	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgrief from Becky showed Tom that the thing in his mind had struck hers
  7922	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\talso--that the Sabbath morning might be half spent before Mrs. Thatcher
  7923	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdiscovered that Becky was not at Mrs. Harper’s.
  7924	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7925	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe children fastened their eyes upon their bit of candle and watched it
  7926	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmelt slowly and pitilessly away; saw the half inch of wick stand alone
  7927	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tat last; saw the feeble flame rise and fall, climb the thin column of
  7928	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsmoke, linger at its top a moment, and then--the horror of utter darkness
  7929	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\treigned!
  7930	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7931	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHow long afterward it was that Becky came to a slow consciousness that
  7932	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tshe was crying in Tom’s arms, neither could tell. All that they knew
  7933	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas, that after what seemed a mighty stretch of time, both awoke out of
  7934	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta dead stupor of sleep and resumed their miseries once more. Tom said
  7935	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tit might be Sunday, now--maybe Monday. He tried to get Becky to talk, but
  7936	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ther sorrows were too oppressive, all her hopes were gone. Tom said that
  7937	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthey must have been missed long ago, and no doubt the search was going
  7938	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ton. He would shout and maybe some one would come. He tried it; but in
  7939	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe darkness the distant echoes sounded so hideously that he tried it no
  7940	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmore.
  7941	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7942	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe hours wasted away, and hunger came to torment the captives again. A
  7943	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tportion of Tom’s half of the cake was left; they divided and ate it. But
  7944	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthey seemed hungrier than before. The poor morsel of food only whetted
  7945	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdesire.
  7946	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7947	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBy-and-by Tom said:
  7948	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7949	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“SH! Did you hear that?”
  7950	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7951	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBoth held their breath and listened. There was a sound like the
  7952	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfaintest, far-off shout. Instantly Tom answered it, and leading Becky by
  7953	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe hand, started groping down the corridor in its direction. Presently
  7954	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\the listened again; again the sound was heard, and apparently a little
  7955	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnearer.
  7956	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7957	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s them!” said Tom; “they’re coming! Come along, Becky--we’re all
  7958	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tright now!”
  7959	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7960	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe joy of the prisoners was almost overwhelming. Their speed was slow,
  7961	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thowever, because pitfalls were somewhat common, and had to be guarded
  7962	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tagainst. They shortly came to one and had to stop. It might be three
  7963	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfeet deep, it might be a hundred--there was no passing it at any rate.
  7964	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom got down on his breast and reached as far down as he could. No
  7965	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbottom. They must stay there and wait until the searchers came. They
  7966	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlistened; evidently the distant shoutings were growing more distant!
  7967	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta moment or two more and they had gone altogether. The heart-sinking
  7968	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmisery of it! Tom whooped until he was hoarse, but it was of no use. He
  7969	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttalked hopefully to Becky; but an age of anxious waiting passed and no
  7970	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsounds came again.
  7971	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7972	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe children groped their way back to the spring. The weary time dragged
  7973	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ton; they slept again, and awoke famished and woe-stricken. Tom believed
  7974	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tit must be Tuesday by this time.
  7975	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7976	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tNow an idea struck him. There were some side passages near at hand. It
  7977	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twould be better to explore some of these than bear the weight of the
  7978	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\theavy time in idleness. He took a kite-line from his pocket, tied it to
  7979	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta projection, and he and Becky started, Tom in the lead, unwinding the
  7980	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tline as he groped along. At the end of twenty steps the corridor ended
  7981	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin a “jumping-off place.” Tom got down on his knees and felt below,
  7982	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand then as far around the corner as he could reach with his hands
  7983	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tconveniently; he made an effort to stretch yet a little farther to the
  7984	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tright, and at that moment, not twenty yards away, a human hand, holding
  7985	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta candle, appeared from behind a rock! Tom lifted up a glorious shout,
  7986	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand instantly that hand was followed by the body it belonged to--Injun
  7987	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tJoe’s! Tom was paralyzed; he could not move. He was vastly gratified the
  7988	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnext moment, to see the “Spaniard” take to his heels and get himself out
  7989	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof sight. Tom wondered that Joe had not recognized his voice and come
  7990	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tover and killed him for testifying in court. But the echoes must have
  7991	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdisguised the voice. Without doubt, that was it, he reasoned. Tom’s
  7992	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfright weakened every muscle in his body. He said to himself that if he
  7993	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thad strength enough to get back to the spring he would stay there, and
  7994	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnothing should tempt him to run the risk of meeting Injun Joe again. He
  7995	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas careful to keep from Becky what it was he had seen. He told her he
  7996	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thad only shouted “for luck.”
  7997	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  7998	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBut hunger and wretchedness rise superior to fears in the long run.
  7999	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAnother tedious wait at the spring and another long sleep brought
  8000	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tchanges. The children awoke tortured with a raging hunger. Tom believed
  8001	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat it must be Wednesday or Thursday or even Friday or Saturday, now,
  8002	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand that the search had been given over. He proposed to explore another
  8003	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpassage. He felt willing to risk Injun Joe and all other terrors. But
  8004	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBecky was very weak. She had sunk into a dreary apathy and would not be
  8005	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\troused. She said she would wait, now, where she was, and die--it would
  8006	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnot be long. She told Tom to go with the kite-line and explore if he
  8007	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tchose; but she implored him to come back every little while and speak
  8008	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto her; and she made him promise that when the awful time came, he would
  8009	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstay by her and hold her hand until all was over.
  8010	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8011	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom kissed her, with a choking sensation in his throat, and made a show
  8012	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof being confident of finding the searchers or an escape from the cave;
  8013	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthen he took the kite-line in his hand and went groping down one of the
  8014	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpassages on his hands and knees, distressed with hunger and sick with
  8015	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbodings of coming doom.

  8022	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTUESDAY afternoon came, and waned to the twilight. The village of St.
  8023	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tPetersburg still mourned. The lost children had not been found. Public
  8024	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tprayers had been offered up for them, and many and many a private prayer
  8025	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat had the petitioner’s whole heart in it; but still no good news came
  8026	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfrom the cave. The majority of the searchers had given up the quest
  8027	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand gone back to their daily avocations, saying that it was plain the
  8028	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tchildren could never be found. Mrs. Thatcher was very ill, and a great
  8029	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpart of the time delirious. People said it was heartbreaking to hear her
  8030	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcall her child, and raise her head and listen a whole minute at a time,
  8031	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthen lay it wearily down again with a moan. Aunt Polly had drooped into
  8032	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta settled melancholy, and her gray hair had grown almost white. The
  8033	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tvillage went to its rest on Tuesday night, sad and forlorn.
  8034	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8035	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAway in the middle of the night a wild peal burst from the village
  8036	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbells, and in a moment the streets were swarming with frantic half-clad
  8037	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpeople, who shouted, “Turn out! turn out! they’re found! they’re found!”
  8038	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t Tin pans and horns were added to the din, the population massed itself
  8039	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand moved toward the river, met the children coming in an open carriage
  8040	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdrawn by shouting citizens, thronged around it, joined its homeward
  8041	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmarch, and swept magnificently up the main street roaring huzzah after
  8042	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thuzzah!
  8043	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8044	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe village was illuminated; nobody went to bed again; it was the
  8045	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgreatest night the little town had ever seen. During the first half-hour
  8046	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta procession of villagers filed through Judge Thatcher’s house, seized
  8047	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe saved ones and kissed them, squeezed Mrs. Thatcher’s hand, tried to
  8048	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tspeak but couldn’t--and drifted out raining tears all over the place.
  8049	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8050	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAunt Polly’s happiness was complete, and Mrs. Thatcher’s nearly so. It
  8051	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twould be complete, however, as soon as the messenger dispatched with the
  8052	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgreat news to the cave should get the word to her husband. Tom lay upon
  8053	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta sofa with an eager auditory about him and told the history of the
  8054	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twonderful adventure, putting in many striking additions to adorn it
  8055	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twithal; and closed with a description of how he left Becky and went
  8056	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ton an exploring expedition; how he followed two avenues as far as his
  8057	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tkite-line would reach; how he followed a third to the fullest stretch
  8058	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof the kite-line, and was about to turn back when he glimpsed a far-off
  8059	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tspeck that looked like daylight; dropped the line and groped toward it,
  8060	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpushed his head and shoulders through a small hole, and saw the broad
  8061	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tMississippi rolling by!
  8062	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8063	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd if it had only happened to be night he would not have seen that
  8064	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tspeck of daylight and would not have explored that passage any more! He
  8065	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttold how he went back for Becky and broke the good news and she told
  8066	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thim not to fret her with such stuff, for she was tired, and knew she was
  8067	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgoing to die, and wanted to. He described how he labored with her and
  8068	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tconvinced her; and how she almost died for joy when she had groped to
  8069	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhere she actually saw the blue speck of daylight; how he pushed his way
  8070	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tout at the hole and then helped her out; how they sat there and cried
  8071	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfor gladness; how some men came along in a skiff and Tom hailed them
  8072	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand told them their situation and their famished condition; how the men
  8073	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdidn’t believe the wild tale at first, “because,” said they, “you are
  8074	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfive miles down the river below the valley the cave is in”--then took
  8075	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthem aboard, rowed to a house, gave them supper, made them rest till two
  8076	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tor three hours after dark and then brought them home.
  8077	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8078	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBefore day-dawn, Judge Thatcher and the handful of searchers with him
  8079	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twere tracked out, in the cave, by the twine clews they had strung behind
  8080	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthem, and informed of the great news.
  8081	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8082	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThree days and nights of toil and hunger in the cave were not to
  8083	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbe shaken off at once, as Tom and Becky soon discovered. They were
  8084	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbedridden all of Wednesday and Thursday, and seemed to grow more and
  8085	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmore tired and worn, all the time. Tom got about, a little, on Thursday,
  8086	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas downtown Friday, and nearly as whole as ever Saturday; but Becky
  8087	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdid not leave her room until Sunday, and then she looked as if she had
  8088	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpassed through a wasting illness.
  8089	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8090	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom learned of Huck’s sickness and went to see him on Friday, but could
  8091	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnot be admitted to the bedroom; neither could he on Saturday or Sunday.
  8092	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHe was admitted daily after that, but was warned to keep still about his
  8093	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tadventure and introduce no exciting topic. The Widow Douglas stayed by
  8094	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto see that he obeyed. At home Tom learned of the Cardiff Hill event;
  8095	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\talso that the “ragged man’s” body had eventually been found in the river
  8096	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnear the ferry-landing; he had been drowned while trying to escape,
  8097	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tperhaps.
  8098	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8099	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAbout a fortnight after Tom’s rescue from the cave, he started off to
  8100	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tvisit Huck, who had grown plenty strong enough, now, to hear exciting
  8101	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttalk, and Tom had some that would interest him, he thought. Judge
  8102	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThatcher’s house was on Tom’s way, and he stopped to see Becky. The
  8103	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tJudge and some friends set Tom to talking, and some one asked him
  8104	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tironically if he wouldn’t like to go to the cave again. Tom said he
  8105	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthought he wouldn’t mind it. The Judge said:
  8106	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8107	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, there are others just like you, Tom, I’ve not the least doubt.
  8108	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBut we have taken care of that. Nobody will get lost in that cave any
  8109	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmore.”
  8110	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8111	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why?”
  8112	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8113	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Because I had its big door sheathed with boiler iron two weeks ago, and
  8114	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttriple-locked--and I’ve got the keys.”
  8115	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8116	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom turned as white as a sheet.
  8117	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8118	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“What’s the matter, boy! Here, run, somebody! Fetch a glass of water!”
  8119	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8120	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe water was brought and thrown into Tom’s face.
  8121	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8122	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Ah, now you’re all right. What was the matter with you, Tom?”
  8123	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8124	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, Judge, Injun Joe’s in the cave!”
  8125	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8126	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8127	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8128	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8129	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XXXIII
  8130	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8131	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tWITHIN a few minutes the news had spread, and a dozen skiff-loads of
  8132	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmen were on their way to McDougal’s cave, and the ferryboat, well filled
  8133	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twith passengers, soon followed. Tom Sawyer was in the skiff that bore
  8134	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tJudge Thatcher.
  8135	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8136	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tWhen the cave door was unlocked, a sorrowful sight presented itself in
  8137	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe dim twilight of the place. Injun Joe lay stretched upon the ground,
  8138	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdead, with his face close to the crack of the door, as if his longing
  8139	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\teyes had been fixed, to the latest moment, upon the light and the cheer
  8140	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof the free world outside. Tom was touched, for he knew by his own
  8141	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\texperience how this wretch had suffered. His pity was moved, but
  8142	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnevertheless he felt an abounding sense of relief and security, now,
  8143	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhich revealed to him in a degree which he had not fully appreciated
  8144	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore how vast a weight of dread had been lying upon him since the day
  8145	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\the lifted his voice against this bloody-minded outcast.
  8146	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8147	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tInjun Joe’s bowie-knife lay close by, its blade broken in two. The great
  8148	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfoundation-beam of the door had been chipped and hacked through, with
  8149	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttedious labor; useless labor, too, it was, for the native rock formed a
  8150	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsill outside it, and upon that stubborn material the knife had wrought
  8151	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tno effect; the only damage done was to the knife itself. But if there
  8152	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thad been no stony obstruction there the labor would have been useless
  8153	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstill, for if the beam had been wholly cut away Injun Joe could not have
  8154	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsqueezed his body under the door, and he knew it. So he had only hacked
  8155	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat place in order to be doing something--in order to pass the weary
  8156	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttime--in order to employ his tortured faculties. Ordinarily one could
  8157	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfind half a dozen bits of candle stuck around in the crevices of this
  8158	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tvestibule, left there by tourists; but there were none now. The prisoner
  8159	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thad searched them out and eaten them. He had also contrived to catch a
  8160	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfew bats, and these, also, he had eaten, leaving only their claws. The
  8161	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpoor unfortunate had starved to death. In one place, near at hand, a
  8162	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstalagmite had been slowly growing up from the ground for ages, builded
  8163	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tby the water-drip from a stalactite overhead. The captive had broken off
  8164	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe stalagmite, and upon the stump had placed a stone, wherein he had
  8165	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tscooped a shallow hollow to catch the precious drop that fell once
  8166	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin every three minutes with the dreary regularity of a clock-tick--a
  8167	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdessertspoonful once in four and twenty hours. That drop was falling
  8168	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhen the Pyramids were new; when Troy fell; when the foundations of Rome
  8169	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twere laid; when Christ was crucified; when the Conqueror created the
  8170	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBritish empire; when Columbus sailed; when the massacre at Lexington was
  8171	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“news.”
  8172	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8173	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tIt is falling now; it will still be falling when all these things shall
  8174	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thave sunk down the afternoon of history, and the twilight of tradition,
  8175	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand been swallowed up in the thick night of oblivion. Has everything a
  8176	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpurpose and a mission? Did this drop fall patiently during five thousand
  8177	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tyears to be ready for this flitting human insect’s need? and has it
  8178	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tanother important object to accomplish ten thousand years to come? No
  8179	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmatter. It is many and many a year since the hapless half-breed scooped
  8180	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tout the stone to catch the priceless drops, but to this day the tourist
  8181	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstares longest at that pathetic stone and that slow-dropping water when
  8182	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\the comes to see the wonders of McDougal’s cave. Injun Joe’s cup stands
  8183	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfirst in the list of the cavern’s marvels; even “Aladdin’s Palace”
  8184	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t cannot rival it.
  8185	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8186	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tInjun Joe was buried near the mouth of the cave; and people flocked
  8187	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthere in boats and wagons from the towns and from all the farms and
  8188	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thamlets for seven miles around; they brought their children, and
  8189	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tall sorts of provisions, and confessed that they had had almost as
  8190	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsatisfactory a time at the funeral as they could have had at the
  8191	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thanging.
  8192	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8193	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThis funeral stopped the further growth of one thing--the petition to the
  8194	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgovernor for Injun Joe’s pardon. The petition had been largely signed;
  8195	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmany tearful and eloquent meetings had been held, and a committee of
  8196	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsappy women been appointed to go in deep mourning and wail around the
  8197	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgovernor, and implore him to be a merciful ass and trample his duty
  8198	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tunder foot. Injun Joe was believed to have killed five citizens of the
  8199	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tvillage, but what of that? If he had been Satan himself there would
  8200	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thave been plenty of weaklings ready to scribble their names to a
  8201	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpardon-petition, and drip a tear on it from their permanently impaired
  8202	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand leaky water-works.
  8203	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8204	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe morning after the funeral Tom took Huck to a private place to have
  8205	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tan important talk. Huck had learned all about Tom’s adventure from the
  8206	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tWelshman and the Widow Douglas, by this time, but Tom said he reckoned
  8207	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthere was one thing they had not told him; that thing was what he wanted
  8208	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto talk about now. Huck’s face saddened. He said:
  8209	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8210	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I know what it is. You got into No. 2 and never found anything but
  8211	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhiskey. Nobody told me it was you; but I just knowed it must ‘a’ ben
  8212	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tyou, soon as I heard ‘bout that whiskey business; and I knowed you
  8213	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thadn’t got the money becuz you’d ‘a’ got at me some way or other and
  8214	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttold me even if you was mum to everybody else. Tom, something’s always
  8215	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttold me we’d never get holt of that swag.”
  8216	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8217	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, Huck, I never told on that tavern-keeper. _You_ know his tavern
  8218	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas all right the Saturday I went to the picnic. Don’t you remember you
  8219	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas to watch there that night?”
  8220	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8221	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh yes! Why, it seems ‘bout a year ago. It was that very night that I
  8222	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfollered Injun Joe to the widder’s.”
  8223	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8224	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“_You_ followed him?”
  8225	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8226	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes--but you keep mum. I reckon Injun Joe’s left friends behind him, and
  8227	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tI don’t want ‘em souring on me and doing me mean tricks. If it hadn’t
  8228	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tben for me he’d be down in Texas now, all right.”
  8229	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8230	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThen Huck told his entire adventure in confidence to Tom, who had only
  8231	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\theard of the Welshman’s part of it before.
  8232	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8233	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well,” said Huck, presently, coming back to the main question, “whoever
  8234	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnipped the whiskey in No. 2, nipped the money, too, I reckon--anyways
  8235	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tit’s a goner for us, Tom.”
  8236	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8237	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Huck, that money wasn’t ever in No. 2!”
  8238	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8239	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“What!” Huck searched his comrade’s face keenly. “Tom, have you got on
  8240	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe track of that money again?”
  8241	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8242	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Huck, it’s in the cave!”
  8243	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8244	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHuck’s eyes blazed.
  8245	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8246	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Say it again, Tom.”
  8247	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8248	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“The money’s in the cave!”
  8249	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8250	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tom--honest injun, now--is it fun, or earnest?”
  8251	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8252	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Earnest, Huck--just as earnest as ever I was in my life. Will you go in
  8253	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthere with me and help get it out?”
  8254	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8255	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I bet I will! I will if it’s where we can blaze our way to it and not
  8256	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tget lost.”
  8257	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8258	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Huck, we can do that without the least little bit of trouble in the
  8259	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tworld.”
  8260	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8261	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Good as wheat! What makes you think the money’s--”
  8262	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8263	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Huck, you just wait till we get in there. If we don’t find it I’ll
  8264	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tagree to give you my drum and every thing I’ve got in the world. I will,
  8265	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tby jings.”
  8266	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8267	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right--it’s a whiz. When do you say?”
  8268	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8269	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Right now, if you say it. Are you strong enough?”
  8270	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8271	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Is it far in the cave? I ben on my pins a little, three or four days,
  8272	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tnow, but I can’t walk more’n a mile, Tom--least I don’t think I could.”
  8273	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8274	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s about five mile into there the way anybody but me would go, Huck,
  8275	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbut there’s a mighty short cut that they don’t anybody but me know
  8276	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tabout. Huck, I’ll take you right to it in a skiff. I’ll float the skiff
  8277	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdown there, and I’ll pull it back again all by myself. You needn’t ever
  8278	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tturn your hand over.”
  8279	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8280	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Less start right off, Tom.”
  8281	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8282	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right. We want some bread and meat, and our pipes, and a little
  8283	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbag or two, and two or three kite-strings, and some of these new-fangled
  8284	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthings they call lucifer matches. I tell you, many’s the time I wished I
  8285	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thad some when I was in there before.”
  8286	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8287	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tA trifle after noon the boys borrowed a small skiff from a citizen who
  8288	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas absent, and got under way at once. When they were several miles
  8289	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbelow “Cave Hollow,” Tom said:
  8290	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8291	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now you see this bluff here looks all alike all the way down from the
  8292	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcave hollow--no houses, no wood-yards, bushes all alike. But do you see
  8293	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat white place up yonder where there’s been a landslide? Well, that’s
  8294	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tone of my marks. We’ll get ashore, now.”
  8295	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8296	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThey landed.
  8297	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8298	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now, Huck, where we’re a-standing you could touch that hole I got out
  8299	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof with a fishing-pole. See if you can find it.”
  8300	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8301	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHuck searched all the place about, and found nothing. Tom proudly
  8302	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmarched into a thick clump of sumach bushes and said:
  8303	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8304	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Here you are! Look at it, Huck; it’s the snuggest hole in this country.
  8305	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tYou just keep mum about it. All along I’ve been wanting to be a robber,
  8306	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbut I knew I’d got to have a thing like this, and where to run across
  8307	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tit was the bother. We’ve got it now, and we’ll keep it quiet, only we’ll
  8308	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlet Joe Harper and Ben Rogers in--because of course there’s got to be a
  8309	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tGang, or else there wouldn’t be any style about it. Tom Sawyer’s Gang--it
  8310	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsounds splendid, don’t it, Huck?”
  8311	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8312	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, it just does, Tom. And who’ll we rob?”
  8313	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8314	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, most anybody. Waylay people--that’s mostly the way.”
  8315	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8316	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“And kill them?”
  8317	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8318	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, not always. Hive them in the cave till they raise a ransom.”
  8319	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8320	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“What’s a ransom?”
  8321	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8322	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Money. You make them raise all they can, off’n their friends; and after
  8323	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tyou’ve kept them a year, if it ain’t raised then you kill them. That’s
  8324	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe general way. Only you don’t kill the women. You shut up the women,
  8325	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbut you don’t kill them. They’re always beautiful and rich, and awfully
  8326	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tscared. You take their watches and things, but you always take your hat
  8327	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\toff and talk polite. They ain’t anybody as polite as robbers--you’ll see
  8328	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat in any book. Well, the women get to loving you, and after they’ve
  8329	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbeen in the cave a week or two weeks they stop crying and after that
  8330	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tyou couldn’t get them to leave. If you drove them out they’d turn right
  8331	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\taround and come back. It’s so in all the books.”
  8332	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8333	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, it’s real bully, Tom. I believe it’s better’n to be a pirate.”
  8334	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8335	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, it’s better in some ways, because it’s close to home and circuses
  8336	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand all that.”
  8337	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8338	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBy this time everything was ready and the boys entered the hole, Tom in
  8339	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe lead. They toiled their way to the farther end of the tunnel, then
  8340	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmade their spliced kite-strings fast and moved on. A few steps brought
  8341	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthem to the spring, and Tom felt a shudder quiver all through him.
  8342	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHe showed Huck the fragment of candle-wick perched on a lump of clay
  8343	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tagainst the wall, and described how he and Becky had watched the flame
  8344	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstruggle and expire.
  8345	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8346	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe boys began to quiet down to whispers, now, for the stillness and
  8347	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgloom of the place oppressed their spirits. They went on, and presently
  8348	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tentered and followed Tom’s other corridor until they reached the
  8349	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“jumping-off place.” The candles revealed the fact that it was not
  8350	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\treally a precipice, but only a steep clay hill twenty or thirty feet
  8351	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thigh. Tom whispered:
  8352	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8353	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now I’ll show you something, Huck.”
  8354	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8355	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHe held his candle aloft and said:
  8356	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8357	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Look as far around the corner as you can. Do you see that? There--on the
  8358	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbig rock over yonder--done with candle-smoke.”
  8359	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8360	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tom, it’s a _cross_!”
  8361	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8362	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“_Now_ where’s your Number Two? ‘_under the cross_,’ hey? Right yonder’s
  8363	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhere I saw Injun Joe poke up his candle, Huck!”
  8364	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8365	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHuck stared at the mystic sign awhile, and then said with a shaky voice:
  8366	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8367	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tom, less git out of here!”
  8368	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8369	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“What! and leave the treasure?”
  8370	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8371	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes--leave it. Injun Joe’s ghost is round about there, certain.”
  8372	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8373	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No it ain’t, Huck, no it ain’t. It would ha’nt the place where he
  8374	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdied--away out at the mouth of the cave--five mile from here.”
  8375	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8376	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, Tom, it wouldn’t. It would hang round the money. I know the ways of
  8377	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tghosts, and so do you.”
  8378	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8379	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom began to fear that Huck was right. Mis-givings gathered in his mind.
  8380	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBut presently an idea occurred to him--
  8381	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8382	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Lookyhere, Huck, what fools we’re making of ourselves! Injun Joe’s
  8383	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tghost ain’t a going to come around where there’s a cross!”
  8384	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8385	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe point was well taken. It had its effect.
  8386	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8387	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tom, I didn’t think of that. But that’s so. It’s luck for us, that
  8388	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcross is. I reckon we’ll climb down there and have a hunt for that box.”
  8389	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8390	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom went first, cutting rude steps in the clay hill as he descended.
  8391	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHuck followed. Four avenues opened out of the small cavern which the
  8392	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgreat rock stood in. The boys examined three of them with no result.
  8393	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThey found a small recess in the one nearest the base of the rock, with
  8394	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta pallet of blankets spread down in it; also an old suspender, some
  8395	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbacon rind, and the well-gnawed bones of two or three fowls. But there
  8396	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas no moneybox. The lads searched and researched this place, but in
  8397	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tvain. Tom said:
  8398	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8399	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“He said _under_ the cross. Well, this comes nearest to being under the
  8400	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcross. It can’t be under the rock itself, because that sets solid on the
  8401	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tground.”
  8402	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8403	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThey searched everywhere once more, and then sat down discouraged. Huck
  8404	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcould suggest nothing. By-and-by Tom said:
  8405	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8406	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Lookyhere, Huck, there’s footprints and some candle-grease on the clay
  8407	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tabout one side of this rock, but not on the other sides. Now, what’s
  8408	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat for? I bet you the money _is_ under the rock. I’m going to dig in
  8409	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe clay.”
  8410	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8411	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“That ain’t no bad notion, Tom!” said Huck with animation.
  8412	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8413	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom’s “real Barlow” was out at once, and he had not dug four inches
  8414	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore he struck wood.
  8415	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8416	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hey, Huck!--you hear that?”
  8417	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8418	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHuck began to dig and scratch now. Some boards were soon uncovered and
  8419	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tremoved. They had concealed a natural chasm which led under the rock.
  8420	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom got into this and held his candle as far under the rock as he
  8421	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcould, but said he could not see to the end of the rift. He proposed
  8422	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto explore. He stooped and passed under; the narrow way descended
  8423	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgradually. He followed its winding course, first to the right, then to
  8424	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe left, Huck at his heels. Tom turned a short curve, by-and-by, and
  8425	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\texclaimed:
  8426	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8427	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“My goodness, Huck, lookyhere!”
  8428	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8429	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tIt was the treasure-box, sure enough, occupying a snug little cavern,
  8430	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\talong with an empty powder-keg, a couple of guns in leather cases, two
  8431	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tor three pairs of old moccasins, a leather belt, and some other rubbish
  8432	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twell soaked with the water-drip.
  8433	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8434	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Got it at last!” said Huck, ploughing among the tarnished coins with
  8435	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\this hand. “My, but we’re rich, Tom!”
  8436	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8437	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Huck, I always reckoned we’d get it. It’s just too good to believe, but
  8438	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twe _have_ got it, sure! Say--let’s not fool around here. Let’s snake it
  8439	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tout. Lemme see if I can lift the box.”
  8440	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8441	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tIt weighed about fifty pounds. Tom could lift it, after an awkward
  8442	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfashion, but could not carry it conveniently.
  8443	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8444	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I thought so,” he said; “_They_ carried it like it was heavy, that day
  8445	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tat the ha’nted house. I noticed that. I reckon I was right to think of
  8446	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfetching the little bags along.”
  8447	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8448	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe money was soon in the bags and the boys took it up to the cross
  8449	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\trock.
  8450	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8451	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now less fetch the guns and things,” said Huck.
  8452	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8453	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No, Huck--leave them there. They’re just the tricks to have when we
  8454	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgo to robbing. We’ll keep them there all the time, and we’ll hold our
  8455	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\torgies there, too. It’s an awful snug place for orgies.”
  8456	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8457	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“What orgies?”
  8458	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8459	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I dono. But robbers always have orgies, and of course we’ve got to
  8460	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thave them, too. Come along, Huck, we’ve been in here a long time. It’s
  8461	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgetting late, I reckon. I’m hungry, too. We’ll eat and smoke when we get
  8462	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto the skiff.”
  8463	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8464	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThey presently emerged into the clump of sumach bushes, looked warily
  8465	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tout, found the coast clear, and were soon lunching and smoking in the
  8466	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tskiff. As the sun dipped toward the horizon they pushed out and got
  8467	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tunder way. Tom skimmed up the shore through the long twilight, chatting
  8468	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcheerily with Huck, and landed shortly after dark.
  8469	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8470	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now, Huck,” said Tom, “we’ll hide the money in the loft of the widow’s
  8471	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twoodshed, and I’ll come up in the morning and we’ll count it and divide,
  8472	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand then we’ll hunt up a place out in the woods for it where it will be
  8473	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsafe. Just you lay quiet here and watch the stuff till I run and hook
  8474	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBenny Taylor’s little wagon; I won’t be gone a minute.”
  8475	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8476	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHe disappeared, and presently returned with the wagon, put the two small
  8477	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsacks into it, threw some old rags on top of them, and started off,
  8478	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdragging his cargo behind him. When the boys reached the Welshman’s
  8479	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thouse, they stopped to rest. Just as they were about to move on, the
  8480	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tWelshman stepped out and said:
  8481	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8482	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Hallo, who’s that?”

  8484	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Huck and Tom Sawyer.”
  8485	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8486	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Good! Come along with me, boys, you are keeping everybody waiting.
  8487	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHere--hurry up, trot ahead--I’ll haul the wagon for you. Why, it’s not as
  8488	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tlight as it might be. Got bricks in it?--or old metal?”
  8489	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8490	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Old metal,” said Tom.
  8491	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8492	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I judged so; the boys in this town will take more trouble and fool away
  8493	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmore time hunting up six bits’ worth of old iron to sell to the foundry
  8494	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthan they would to make twice the money at regular work. But that’s
  8495	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thuman nature--hurry along, hurry along!”
  8496	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8497	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe boys wanted to know what the hurry was about.
  8498	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8499	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Never mind; you’ll see, when we get to the Widow Douglas’.”
  8500	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8501	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHuck said with some apprehension--for he was long used to being falsely
  8502	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\taccused:
  8503	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8504	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Mr. Jones, we haven’t been doing nothing.”
  8505	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8506	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe Welshman laughed.
  8507	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8508	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I don’t know, Huck, my boy. I don’t know about that. Ain’t you
  8509	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand the widow good friends?”
  8510	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8511	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes. Well, she’s ben good friends to me, anyway.”
  8512	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8513	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right, then. What do you want to be afraid for?”
  8514	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8515	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThis question was not entirely answered in Huck’s slow mind before he
  8516	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tfound himself pushed, along with Tom, into Mrs. Douglas’ drawing-room.
  8517	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tMr. Jones left the wagon near the door and followed.
  8518	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8519	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe place was grandly lighted, and everybody that was of any consequence
  8520	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin the village was there. The Thatchers were there, the Harpers, the
  8521	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tRogerses, Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, the minister, the editor, and a great
  8522	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmany more, and all dressed in their best. The widow received the boys
  8523	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tas heartily as any one could well receive two such looking beings. They
  8524	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twere covered with clay and candle-grease. Aunt Polly blushed crimson
  8525	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twith humiliation, and frowned and shook her head at Tom. Nobody suffered
  8526	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thalf as much as the two boys did, however. Mr. Jones said:
  8527	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8528	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tom wasn’t at home, yet, so I gave him up; but I stumbled on him and
  8529	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHuck right at my door, and so I just brought them along in a hurry.”
  8530	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8531	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“And you did just right,” said the widow. “Come with me, boys.”
  8532	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8533	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tShe took them to a bedchamber and said:
  8534	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8535	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now wash and dress yourselves. Here are two new suits of
  8536	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tclothes--shirts, socks, everything complete. They’re Huck’s--no, no
  8537	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthanks, Huck--Mr. Jones bought one and I the other. But they’ll fit both
  8538	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tof you. Get into them. We’ll wait--come down when you are slicked up
  8539	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tenough.”
  8540	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8541	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThen she left.
  8542	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t

  8547	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8548	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHUCK said: “Tom, we can slope, if we can find a rope. The window ain’t
  8549	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thigh from the ground.”
  8550	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8551	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Shucks! what do you want to slope for?”
  8552	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8553	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I ain’t used to that kind of a crowd. I can’t stand it. I ain’t
  8554	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgoing down there, Tom.”
  8555	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8556	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, bother! It ain’t anything. I don’t mind it a bit. I’ll take care of
  8557	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tyou.”
  8558	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8559	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tSid appeared.
  8560	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8561	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tom,” said he, “auntie has been waiting for you all the afternoon. Mary
  8562	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgot your Sunday clothes ready, and everybody’s been fretting about you.
  8563	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tSay--ain’t this grease and clay, on your clothes?”
  8564	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8565	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now, Mr. Siddy, you jist ‘tend to your own business. What’s all this
  8566	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tblowout about, anyway?”
  8567	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8568	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s one of the widow’s parties that she’s always having. This time
  8569	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tit’s for the Welshman and his sons, on account of that scrape they
  8570	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thelped her out of the other night. And say--I can tell you something, if
  8571	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tyou want to know.”
  8572	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8573	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, what?”
  8574	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8575	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Why, old Mr. Jones is going to try to spring something on the people
  8576	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\there tonight, but I overheard him tell auntie today about it, as a
  8577	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsecret, but I reckon it’s not much of a secret now. Everybody knows--the
  8578	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twidow, too, for all she tries to let on she don’t. Mr. Jones was bound
  8579	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHuck should be here--couldn’t get along with his grand secret without
  8580	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHuck, you know!”
  8581	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8582	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Secret about what, Sid?”
  8583	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8584	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“About Huck tracking the robbers to the widow’s. I reckon Mr. Jones was
  8585	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgoing to make a grand time over his surprise, but I bet you it will drop
  8586	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpretty flat.”
  8587	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8588	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tSid chuckled in a very contented and satisfied way.
  8589	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8590	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Sid, was it you that told?”
  8591	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8592	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, never mind who it was. _Somebody_ told--that’s enough.”
  8593	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8594	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Sid, there’s only one person in this town mean enough to do that, and
  8595	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthat’s you. If you had been in Huck’s place you’d ‘a’ sneaked down the
  8596	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thill and never told anybody on the robbers. You can’t do any but mean
  8597	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthings, and you can’t bear to see anybody praised for doing good ones.
  8598	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThere--no thanks, as the widow says”--and Tom cuffed Sid’s ears and helped
  8599	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thim to the door with several kicks. “Now go and tell auntie if you
  8600	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdare--and tomorrow you’ll catch it!”
  8601	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8602	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tSome minutes later the widow’s guests were at the supper-table, and a
  8603	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdozen children were propped up at little side-tables in the same room,
  8604	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tafter the fashion of that country and that day. At the proper time Mr.
  8605	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tJones made his little speech, in which he thanked the widow for the
  8606	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thonor she was doing himself and his sons, but said that there was
  8607	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tanother person whose modesty--
  8608	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8609	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tAnd so forth and so on. He sprung his secret about Huck’s share in
  8610	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe adventure in the finest dramatic manner he was master of, but the
  8611	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsurprise it occasioned was largely counterfeit and not as clamorous and
  8612	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\teffusive as it might have been under happier circumstances. However,
  8613	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe widow made a pretty fair show of astonishment, and heaped so many
  8614	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcompliments and so much gratitude upon Huck that he almost forgot
  8615	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe nearly intolerable discomfort of his new clothes in the entirely
  8616	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tintolerable discomfort of being set up as a target for everybody’s gaze
  8617	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand everybody’s laudations.
  8618	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8619	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe widow said she meant to give Huck a home under her roof and have him
  8620	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\teducated; and that when she could spare the money she would start him in
  8621	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbusiness in a modest way. Tom’s chance was come. He said:
  8622	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8623	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Huck don’t need it. Huck’s rich.”
  8624	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8625	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tNothing but a heavy strain upon the good manners of the company kept
  8626	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tback the due and proper complimentary laugh at this pleasant joke. But
  8627	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe silence was a little awkward. Tom broke it:
  8628	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8629	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Huck’s got money. Maybe you don’t believe it, but he’s got lots of it.
  8630	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tOh, you needn’t smile--I reckon I can show you. You just wait a minute.”
  8631	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8632	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom ran out of doors. The company looked at each other with a perplexed
  8633	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tinterest--and inquiringly at Huck, who was tongue-tied.
  8634	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8635	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Sid, what ails Tom?” said Aunt Polly. “He--well, there ain’t ever any
  8636	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmaking of that boy out. I never--”
  8637	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8638	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom entered, struggling with the weight of his sacks, and Aunt Polly
  8639	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdid not finish her sentence. Tom poured the mass of yellow coin upon the
  8640	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttable and said:
  8641	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8642	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“There--what did I tell you? Half of it’s Huck’s and half of it’s mine!”
  8643	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8644	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe spectacle took the general breath away. All gazed, nobody spoke for
  8645	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta moment. Then there was a unanimous call for an explanation. Tom said
  8646	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\the could furnish it, and he did. The tale was long, but brimful of
  8647	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tinterest. There was scarcely an interruption from any one to break the
  8648	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcharm of its flow. When he had finished, Mr. Jones said:
  8649	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8650	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“I thought I had fixed up a little surprise for this occasion, but it
  8651	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdon’t amount to anything now. This one makes it sing mighty small, I’m
  8652	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twilling to allow.”
  8653	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8654	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe money was counted. The sum amounted to a little over twelve thousand
  8655	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdollars. It was more than any one present had ever seen at one time
  8656	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbefore, though several persons were there who were worth considerably
  8657	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmore than that in property.
  8658	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8659	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8660	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8661	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8662	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tCHAPTER XXXV
  8663	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8664	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTHE reader may rest satisfied that Tom’s and Huck’s windfall made a
  8665	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmighty stir in the poor little village of St. Petersburg. So vast a
  8666	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsum, all in actual cash, seemed next to incredible. It was talked
  8667	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tabout, gloated over, glorified, until the reason of many of the citizens
  8668	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttottered under the strain of the unhealthy excitement. Every “haunted”
  8669	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t house in St. Petersburg and the neighboring villages was dissected,
  8670	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tplank by plank, and its foundations dug up and ransacked for hidden
  8671	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttreasure--and not by boys, but men--pretty grave, unromantic men, too,
  8672	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsome of them. Wherever Tom and Huck appeared they were courted, admired,
  8673	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstared at. The boys were not able to remember that their remarks had
  8674	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpossessed weight before; but now their sayings were treasured and
  8675	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\trepeated; everything they did seemed somehow to be regarded as
  8676	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tremarkable; they had evidently lost the power of doing and saying
  8677	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcommonplace things; moreover, their past history was raked up and
  8678	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tdiscovered to bear marks of conspicuous originality. The village paper
  8679	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpublished biographical sketches of the boys.
  8680	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8681	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThe Widow Douglas put Huck’s money out at six per cent., and Judge
  8682	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tThatcher did the same with Tom’s at Aunt Polly’s request. Each lad had
  8683	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tan income, now, that was simply prodigious--a dollar for every weekday in
  8684	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe year and half of the Sundays. It was just what the minister got--no,
  8685	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tit was what he was promised--he generally couldn’t collect it. A dollar
  8686	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand a quarter a week would board, lodge, and school a boy in those old
  8687	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsimple days--and clothe him and wash him, too, for that matter.
  8688	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8689	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tJudge Thatcher had conceived a great opinion of Tom. He said that no
  8690	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcommonplace boy would ever have got his daughter out of the cave. When
  8691	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tBecky told her father, in strict confidence, how Tom had taken her
  8692	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhipping at school, the Judge was visibly moved; and when she pleaded
  8693	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgrace for the mighty lie which Tom had told in order to shift that
  8694	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twhipping from her shoulders to his own, the Judge said with a fine
  8695	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\toutburst that it was a noble, a generous, a magnanimous lie--a lie that
  8696	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twas worthy to hold up its head and march down through history breast to
  8697	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbreast with George Washington’s lauded Truth about the hatchet! Becky
  8698	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthought her father had never looked so tall and so superb as when he
  8699	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twalked the floor and stamped his foot and said that. She went straight
  8700	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\toff and told Tom about it.
  8701	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8702	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tJudge Thatcher hoped to see Tom a great lawyer or a great soldier some
  8703	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tday. He said he meant to look to it that Tom should be admitted to the
  8704	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tNational Military Academy and afterward trained in the best law school
  8705	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin the country, in order that he might be ready for either career or
  8706	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tboth.
  8707	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8708	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHuck Finn’s wealth and the fact that he was now under the Widow Douglas’
  8709	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tprotection introduced him into society--no, dragged him into it, hurled
  8710	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thim into it--and his sufferings were almost more than he could bear. The
  8711	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twidow’s servants kept him clean and neat, combed and brushed, and they
  8712	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbedded him nightly in unsympathetic sheets that had not one little spot
  8713	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tor stain which he could press to his heart and know for a friend. He had
  8714	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto eat with a knife and fork; he had to use napkin, cup, and plate;
  8715	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\the had to learn his book, he had to go to church; he had to talk so
  8716	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tproperly that speech was become insipid in his mouth; whithersoever he
  8717	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tturned, the bars and shackles of civilization shut him in and bound him
  8718	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thand and foot.
  8719	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t

  8721	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmissing. For forty-eight hours the widow hunted for him everywhere in
  8722	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgreat distress. The public were profoundly concerned; they searched high
  8723	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand low, they dragged the river for his body. Early the third morning
  8724	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom Sawyer wisely went poking among some old empty hogsheads down behind
  8725	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe abandoned slaughter-house, and in one of them he found the refugee.
  8726	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHuck had slept there; he had just breakfasted upon some stolen odds and
  8727	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tends of food, and was lying off, now, in comfort, with his pipe. He was
  8728	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tunkempt, uncombed, and clad in the same old ruin of rags that had made
  8729	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thim picturesque in the days when he was free and happy. Tom routed him
  8730	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tout, told him the trouble he had been causing, and urged him to go home.
  8731	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHuck’s face lost its tranquil content, and took a melancholy cast. He
  8732	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid:
  8733	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8734	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Don’t talk about it, Tom. I’ve tried it, and it don’t work; it don’t
  8735	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twork, Tom. It ain’t for me; I ain’t used to it. The widder’s good to me,
  8736	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand friendly; but I can’t stand them ways. She makes me get up just
  8737	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tat the same time every morning; she makes me wash, they comb me all
  8738	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto thunder; she won’t let me sleep in the woodshed; I got to wear them
  8739	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tblamed clothes that just smothers me, Tom; they don’t seem to any air
  8740	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgit through ‘em, somehow; and they’re so rotten nice that I can’t
  8741	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tset down, nor lay down, nor roll around anywher’s; I hain’t slid on a
  8742	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcellar-door for--well, it ‘pears to be years; I got to go to church
  8743	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand sweat and sweat--I hate them ornery sermons! I can’t ketch a fly in
  8744	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthere, I can’t chaw. I got to wear shoes all Sunday. The widder eats by
  8745	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta bell; she goes to bed by a bell; she gits up by a bell--everything’s so
  8746	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tawful reg’lar a body can’t stand it.”
  8747	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8748	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, everybody does that way, Huck.”
  8749	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8750	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Tom, it don’t make no difference. I ain’t everybody, and I can’t
  8751	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t_stand_ it. It’s awful to be tied up so. And grub comes too easy--I don’t
  8752	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttake no interest in vittles, that way. I got to ask to go a-fishing;
  8753	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tI got to ask to go in a-swimming--dern’d if I hain’t got to ask to do
  8754	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\teverything. Well, I’d got to talk so nice it wasn’t no comfort--I’d got
  8755	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tto go up in the attic and rip out awhile, every day, to git a taste
  8756	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin my mouth, or I’d a died, Tom. The widder wouldn’t let me smoke;
  8757	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tshe wouldn’t let me yell, she wouldn’t let me gape, nor stretch, nor
  8758	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tscratch, before folks--” [Then with a spasm of special irritation and
  8759	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tinjury]--“And dad fetch it, she prayed all the time! I never see such a
  8760	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twoman! I _had_ to shove, Tom--I just had to. And besides, that school’s
  8761	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tgoing to open, and I’d a had to go to it--well, I wouldn’t stand _that_,
  8762	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom. Looky-here, Tom, being rich ain’t what it’s cracked up to be. It’s
  8763	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tjust worry and worry, and sweat and sweat, and a-wishing you was dead
  8764	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tall the time. Now these clothes suits me, and this bar’l suits me, and
  8765	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tI ain’t ever going to shake ‘em any more. Tom, I wouldn’t ever got into
  8766	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tall this trouble if it hadn’t ‘a’ ben for that money; now you just take
  8767	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmy sheer of it along with your’n, and gimme a ten-center sometimes--not
  8768	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmany times, becuz I don’t give a dern for a thing ‘thout it’s tollable
  8769	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thard to git--and you go and beg off for me with the widder.”
  8770	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8771	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, Huck, you know I can’t do that. ‘Tain’t fair; and besides if you’ll
  8772	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttry this thing just a while longer you’ll come to like it.”
  8773	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8774	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Like it! Yes--the way I’d like a hot stove if I was to set on it long
  8775	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tenough. No, Tom, I won’t be rich, and I won’t live in them cussed
  8776	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsmothery houses. I like the woods, and the river, and hogsheads, and
  8777	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tI’ll stick to ‘em, too. Blame it all! just as we’d got guns, and a cave,
  8778	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand all just fixed to rob, here this dern foolishness has got to come up
  8779	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tand spile it all!”
  8780	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8781	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tTom saw his opportunity--
  8782	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8783	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Lookyhere, Huck, being rich ain’t going to keep me back from turning

  8785	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8786	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“No! Oh, good-licks; are you in real dead-wood earnest, Tom?”
  8787	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8788	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Just as dead earnest as I’m sitting here. But Huck, we can’t let you
  8789	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tinto the gang if you ain’t respectable, you know.”
  8790	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8791	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHuck’s joy was quenched.
  8792	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8793	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Can’t let me in, Tom? Didn’t you let me go for a pirate?”
  8794	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8795	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, but that’s different. A robber is more high-toned than what a
  8796	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpirate is--as a general thing. In most countries they’re awful high up in
  8797	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe nobility--dukes and such.”
  8798	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8799	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now, Tom, hain’t you always ben friendly to me? You wouldn’t shet me
  8800	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tout, would you, Tom? You wouldn’t do that, now, _would_ you, Tom?”
  8801	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8802	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Huck, I wouldn’t want to, and I _don’t_ want to--but what would people
  8803	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsay? Why, they’d say, ‘Mph! Tom Sawyer’s Gang! pretty low characters in
  8804	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tit!’ They’d mean you, Huck. You wouldn’t like that, and I wouldn’t.”
  8805	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8806	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tHuck was silent for some time, engaged in a mental struggle. Finally he
  8807	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsaid:
  8808	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8809	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I’ll go back to the widder for a month and tackle it and see if I
  8810	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tcan come to stand it, if you’ll let me b’long to the gang, Tom.”
  8811	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8812	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“All right, Huck, it’s a whiz! Come along, old chap, and I’ll ask the
  8813	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\twidow to let up on you a little, Huck.”
  8814	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8815	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Will you, Tom--now will you? That’s good. If she’ll let up on some of
  8816	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthe roughest things, I’ll smoke private and cuss private, and crowd
  8817	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tthrough or bust. When you going to start the gang and turn robbers?”
  8818	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8819	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Oh, right off. We’ll get the boys together and have the initiation
  8820	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ttonight, maybe.”
  8821	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8822	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Have the which?”
  8823	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8824	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Have the initiation.”
  8825	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8826	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“What’s that?”
  8827	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8828	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“It’s to swear to stand by one another, and never tell the gang’s
  8829	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tsecrets, even if you’re chopped all to flinders, and kill anybody and
  8830	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tall his family that hurts one of the gang.”
  8831	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8832	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“That’s gay--that’s mighty gay, Tom, I tell you.”
  8833	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8834	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, I bet it is. And all that swearing’s got to be done at midnight,
  8835	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tin the lonesomest, awfulest place you can find--a ha’nted house is the
  8836	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tbest, but they’re all ripped up now.”
  8837	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8838	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Well, midnight’s good, anyway, Tom.”
  8839	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8840	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Yes, so it is. And you’ve got to swear on a coffin, and sign it with
  8841	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tblood.”
  8842	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8843	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t“Now, that’s something _like_! Why, it’s a million times bullier than
  8844	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpirating. I’ll stick to the widder till I rot, Tom; and if I git to be
  8845	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\ta reg’lar ripper of a robber, and everybody talking ‘bout it, I reckon
  8846	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tshe’ll be proud she snaked me in out of the wet.”

  8849	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8850	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tSO endeth this chronicle. It being strictly a history of a _boy_, it
  8851	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tmust stop here; the story could not go much further without becoming the
  8852	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\thistory of a _man_. When one writes a novel about grown people, he knows
  8853	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\texactly where to stop--that is, with a marriage; but when he writes of
  8854	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tjuveniles, he must stop where he best can.
  8855	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\t
  8856	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tMost of the characters that perform in this book still live, and are
  8857	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tprosperous and happy. Some day it may seem worth while to take up the
  8858	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tstory of the younger ones again and see what sort of men and women they
  8859	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tturned out to be; therefore it will be wisest not to reveal any of that
  8860	TheAdventuresOfTomSawyerByMarkTwain.txt\tpart of their lives at present.
