    46	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
    47	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tOne morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found
    48	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thimself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin.  He lay on
    49	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\this armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could
    50	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsee his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff
    51	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsections.  The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready
    52	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tto slide off any moment.  His many legs, pitifully thin compared
    53	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twith the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he
    54	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tlooked.
    55	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
    56	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t"What's happened to me?" he thought.  It wasn't a dream.  His room,
    57	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ta proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully
    58	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbetween its four familiar walls.  A collection of textile samples
    59	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tlay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and
    60	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tabove it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an
    61	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tillustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame.  It showed
    62	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ta lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright,
    63	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\traising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm
    64	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ttowards the viewer.
    65	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
    66	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tGregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather.
    67	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tDrops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel
    68	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tquite sad.  "How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all
    69	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthis nonsense", he thought, but that was something he was unable to
    70	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdo because he was used to sleeping on his right, and in his present
    71	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tstate couldn't get into that position.  However hard he threw
    72	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thimself onto his right, he always rolled back to where he was.  He
    73	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tmust have tried it a hundred times, shut his eyes so that he
    74	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twouldn't have to look at the floundering legs, and only stopped when
    75	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\the began to feel a mild, dull pain there that he had never felt
    76	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbefore.
    77	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
    78	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t"Oh, God", he thought, "what a strenuous career it is that I've
    79	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tchosen! Travelling day in and day out.  Doing business like this
    80	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ttakes much more effort than doing your own business at home, and on
    81	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ttop of that there's the curse of travelling, worries about making
    82	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ttrain connections, bad and irregular food, contact with different
    83	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tpeople all the time so that you can never get to know anyone or
    84	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbecome friendly with them.  It can all go to Hell!"  He felt a
    85	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tslight itch up on his belly; pushed himself slowly up on his back
    86	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ttowards the headboard so that he could lift his head better; found
    87	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twhere the itch was, and saw that it was covered with lots of little
    88	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twhite spots which he didn't know what to make of; and when he tried
    89	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tto feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly back
    90	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbecause as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold shudder.
    91	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
    92	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tHe slid back into his former position.  "Getting up early all the
    93	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ttime", he thought, "it makes you stupid.  You've got to get enough
    94	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsleep.  Other travelling salesmen live a life of luxury.  For
    95	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tinstance, whenever I go back to the guest house during the morning
    96	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tto copy out the contract, these gentlemen are always still sitting
    97	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthere eating their breakfasts.  I ought to just try that with my
    98	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tboss; I'd get kicked out on the spot.  But who knows, maybe that
    99	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twould be the best thing for me.  If I didn't have my parents to
   100	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthink about I'd have given in my notice a long time ago, I'd have
   101	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tgone up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell him
   102	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\teverything I would, let him know just what I feel.  He'd fall right
   103	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\toff his desk! And it's a funny sort of business to be sitting up
   104	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthere at your desk, talking down at your subordinates from up there,
   105	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tespecially when you have to go right up close because the boss is
   106	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thard of hearing.  Well, there's still some hope; once I've got the
   107	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tmoney together to pay off my parents' debt to him - another five or
   108	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsix years I suppose - that's definitely what I'll do.  That's when
   109	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tI'll make the big change.  First of all though, I've got to get up,
   110	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tmy train leaves at five."
   111	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
   112	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tAnd he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of
   113	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdrawers.  "God in Heaven!" he thought.  It was half past six and the
   114	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thands were quietly moving forwards, it was even later than half
   115	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tpast, more like quarter to seven.  Had the alarm clock not rung? He
   116	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcould see from the bed that it had been set for four o'clock as it
   117	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tshould have been; it certainly must have rung.  Yes, but was it
   118	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tpossible to quietly sleep through that furniture-rattling noise?
   119	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tTrue, he had not slept peacefully, but probably all the more deeply
   120	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbecause of that.  What should he do now? The next train went at
   121	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tseven; if he were to catch that he would have to rush like mad and
   122	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe collection of samples was still not packed, and he did not at
   123	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tall feel particularly fresh and lively.  And even if he did catch
   124	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe train he would not avoid his boss's anger as the office
   125	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tassistant would have been there to see the five o'clock train go, he
   126	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twould have put in his report about Gregor's not being there a long
   127	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ttime ago.  The office assistant was the boss's man, spineless, and
   128	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twith no understanding.  What about if he reported sick? But that
   129	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twould be extremely strained and suspicious as in fifteen years of
   130	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tservice Gregor had never once yet been ill.  His boss would
   131	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcertainly come round with the doctor from the medical insurance
   132	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcompany, accuse his parents of having a lazy son, and accept the
   133	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdoctor's recommendation not to make any claim as the doctor believed
   134	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthat no-one was ever ill but that many were workshy.  And what's
   135	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tmore, would he have been entirely wrong in this case? Gregor did in
   136	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfact, apart from excessive sleepiness after sleeping for so long,
   137	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfeel completely well and even felt much hungrier than usual.
   138	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
   139	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tHe was still hurriedly thinking all this through, unable to decide
   140	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tto get out of the bed, when the clock struck quarter to seven.
   141	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tThere was a cautious knock at the door near his head.  "Gregor",
   142	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsomebody called - it was his mother - "it's quarter to seven.
   143	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tDidn't you want to go somewhere?"  That gentle voice! Gregor was
   144	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tshocked when he heard his own voice answering, it could hardly be
   145	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\trecognised as the voice he had had before.  As if from deep inside
   146	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thim, there was a painful and uncontrollable squeaking mixed in with
   147	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tit, the words could be made out at first but then there was a sort
   148	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tof echo which made them unclear, leaving the hearer unsure whether
   149	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\the had heard properly or not.  Gregor had wanted to give a full
   150	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tanswer and explain everything, but in the circumstances contented
   151	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thimself with saying: "Yes, mother, yes, thank-you, I'm getting up
   152	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tnow."  The change in Gregor's voice probably could not be noticed
   153	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\toutside through the wooden door, as his mother was satisfied with
   154	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthis explanation and shuffled away.  But this short conversation
   155	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tmade the other members of the family aware that Gregor, against
   156	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ttheir expectations was still at home, and soon his father came
   157	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tknocking at one of the side doors, gently, but with his fist.
   158	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t"Gregor, Gregor", he called, "what's wrong?"  And after a short
   159	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twhile he called again with a warning deepness in his voice: "Gregor!
   160	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tGregor!"  At the other side door his sister came plaintively:
   161	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t"Gregor? Aren't you well? Do you need anything?"  Gregor answered to
   162	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tboth sides: "I'm ready, now", making an effort to remove all the
   163	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tstrangeness from his voice by enunciating very carefully and putting
   164	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tlong pauses between each, individual word.  His father went back to
   165	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\this breakfast, but his sister whispered: "Gregor, open the door, I
   166	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbeg of you."  Gregor, however, had no thought of opening the door,
   167	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tand instead congratulated himself for his cautious habit, acquired
   168	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfrom his travelling, of locking all doors at night even when he was
   169	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tat home.
   170	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
   171	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tThe first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without being
   172	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdisturbed, to get dressed, and most of all to have his breakfast.
   173	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tOnly then would he consider what to do next, as he was well aware
   174	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthat he would not bring his thoughts to any sensible conclusions by
   175	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tlying in bed.  He remembered that he had often felt a slight pain in
   176	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbed, perhaps caused by lying awkwardly, but that had always turned
   177	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tout to be pure imagination and he wondered how his imaginings would
   178	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tslowly resolve themselves today.  He did not have the slightest
   179	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdoubt that the change in his voice was nothing more than the first
   180	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsign of a serious cold, which was an occupational hazard for
   181	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ttravelling salesmen.
   182	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
   183	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tIt was a simple matter to throw off the covers; he only had to blow
   184	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thimself up a little and they fell off by themselves.  But it became
   185	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdifficult after that, especially as he was so exceptionally broad.
   186	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tHe would have used his arms and his hands to push himself up; but
   187	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tinstead of them he only had all those little legs continuously
   188	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tmoving in different directions, and which he was moreover unable to
   189	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcontrol.  If he wanted to bend one of them, then that was the first
   190	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tone that would stretch itself out; and if he finally managed to do
   191	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twhat he wanted with that leg, all the others seemed to be set free
   192	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tand would move about painfully.  "This is something that can't be
   193	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdone in bed", Gregor said to himself, "so don't keep trying to do
   194	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tit".
   195	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
   196	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tThe first thing he wanted to do was get the lower part of his body
   197	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tout of the bed, but he had never seen this lower part, and could not
   198	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\timagine what it looked like; it turned out to be too hard to move;
   199	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tit went so slowly; and finally, almost in a frenzy, when he
   200	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcarelessly shoved himself forwards with all the force he could
   201	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tgather, he chose the wrong direction, hit hard against the lower
   202	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbedpost, and learned from the burning pain he felt that the lower
   203	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tpart of his body might well, at present, be the most sensitive.
   204	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
   205	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tSo then he tried to get the top part of his body out of the bed
   206	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfirst, carefully turning his head to the side.  This he managed
   207	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tquite easily, and despite its breadth and its weight, the bulk of
   208	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\this body eventually followed slowly in the direction of the head.
   209	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tBut when he had at last got his head out of the bed and into the
   210	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfresh air it occurred to him that if he let himself fall it would be
   211	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ta miracle if his head were not injured, so he became afraid to carry
   212	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ton pushing himself forward the same way.  And he could not knock
   213	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thimself out now at any price; better to stay in bed than lose
   214	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tconsciousness.
   215	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
   216	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tIt took just as much effort to get back to where he had been
   217	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tearlier, but when he lay there sighing, and was once more watching
   218	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\this legs as they struggled against each other even harder than
   219	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbefore, if that was possible, he could think of no way of bringing
   220	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tpeace and order to this chaos.  He told himself once more that it
   221	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twas not possible for him to stay in bed and that the most sensible
   222	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthing to do would be to get free of it in whatever way he could at
   223	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twhatever sacrifice.  At the same time, though, he did not forget to
   224	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tremind himself that calm consideration was much better than rushing
   225	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tto desperate conclusions.  At times like this he would direct his
   226	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\teyes to the window and look out as clearly as he could, but
   227	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tunfortunately, even the other side of the narrow street was
   228	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tenveloped in morning fog and the view had little confidence or cheer
   229	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tto offer him.  "Seven o'clock, already", he said to himself when the
   230	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tclock struck again, "seven o'clock, and there's still a fog like
   231	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthis."  And he lay there quietly a while longer, breathing lightly
   232	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tas if he perhaps expected the total stillness to bring things back
   233	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tto their real and natural state.
   234	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
   235	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tBut then he said to himself: "Before it strikes quarter past seven
   236	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tI'll definitely have to have got properly out of bed.  And by then
   237	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsomebody will have come round from work to ask what's happened to me
   238	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tas well, as they open up at work before seven o'clock."  And so he
   239	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tset himself to the task of swinging the entire length of his body
   240	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tout of the bed all at the same time.  If he succeeded in falling out
   241	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tof bed in this way and kept his head raised as he did so he could
   242	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tprobably avoid injuring it.  His back seemed to be quite hard, and
   243	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tprobably nothing would happen to it falling onto the carpet.  His
   244	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tmain concern was for the loud noise he was bound to make, and which
   245	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\teven through all the doors would probably raise concern if not
   246	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\talarm.  But it was something that had to be risked.
   247	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
   248	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tWhen Gregor was already sticking half way out of the bed - the new
   249	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tmethod was more of a game than an effort, all he had to do was rock
   250	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tback and forth - it occurred to him how simple everything would be
   251	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tif somebody came to help him.  Two strong people - he had his father
   252	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tand the maid in mind - would have been more than enough; they would
   253	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tonly have to push their arms under the dome of his back, peel him
   254	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\taway from the bed, bend down with the load and then be patient and
   255	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcareful as he swang over onto the floor, where, hopefully, the
   256	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tlittle legs would find a use.  Should he really call for help
   257	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthough, even apart from the fact that all the doors were locked?
   258	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tDespite all the difficulty he was in, he could not suppress a smile
   259	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tat this thought.
   260	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
   261	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tAfter a while he had already moved so far across that it would have
   262	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbeen hard for him to keep his balance if he rocked too hard.  The
   263	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ttime was now ten past seven and he would have to make a final
   264	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdecision very soon.  Then there was a ring at the door of the flat.
   265	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t"That'll be someone from work", he said to himself, and froze very
   266	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tstill, although his little legs only became all the more lively as
   267	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthey danced around.  For a moment everything remained quiet.
   268	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t"They're not opening the door", Gregor said to himself, caught in
   269	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsome nonsensical hope.  But then of course, the maid's firm steps
   270	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twent to the door as ever and opened it.  Gregor only needed to hear
   271	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe visitor's first words of greeting and he knew who it was - the
   272	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tchief clerk himself.  Why did Gregor have to be the only one
   273	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcondemned to work for a company where they immediately became highly
   274	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsuspicious at the slightest shortcoming? Were all employees, every
   275	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tone of them, louts, was there not one of them who was faithful and
   276	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdevoted who would go so mad with pangs of conscience that he
   277	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcouldn't get out of bed if he didn't spend at least a couple of
   278	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thours in the morning on company business? Was it really not enough
   279	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tto let one of the trainees make enquiries - assuming enquiries were
   280	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\teven necessary - did the chief clerk have to come himself, and did
   281	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthey have to show the whole, innocent family that this was so
   282	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsuspicious that only the chief clerk could be trusted to have the
   283	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twisdom to investigate it? And more because these thoughts had made
   284	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thim upset than through any proper decision, he swang himself with
   285	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tall his force out of the bed.  There was a loud thump, but it wasn't
   286	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\treally a loud noise.  His fall was softened a little by the carpet,
   287	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tand Gregor's back was also more elastic than he had thought, which
   288	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tmade the sound muffled and not too noticeable.  He had not held his
   289	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thead carefully enough, though, and hit it as he fell; annoyed and in
   290	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tpain, he turned it and rubbed it against the carpet.
   291	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
   292	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t"Something's fallen down in there", said the chief clerk in the room
   293	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ton the left.  Gregor tried to imagine whether something of the sort
   294	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthat had happened to him today could ever happen to the chief clerk
   295	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ttoo; you had to concede that it was possible.  But as if in gruff
   296	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\treply to this question, the chief clerk's firm footsteps in his
   297	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thighly polished boots could now be heard in the adjoining room.
   298	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tFrom the room on his right, Gregor's sister whispered to him to let
   299	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thim know: "Gregor, the chief clerk is here."  "Yes, I know", said
   300	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tGregor to himself; but without daring to raise his voice loud enough
   301	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfor his sister to hear him.
   302	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
   303	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t"Gregor", said his father now from the room to his left, "the chief
   304	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tclerk has come round and wants to know why you didn't leave on the
   305	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tearly train.  We don't know what to say to him.  And anyway, he
   306	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twants to speak to you personally.  So please open up this door.  I'm
   307	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsure he'll be good enough to forgive the untidiness of your room."
   308	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tThen the chief clerk called "Good morning,  Mr. Samsa". "He isn't
   309	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twell", said his mother to the chief clerk, while his father
   310	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcontinued to speak through the door.  "He isn't well, please believe
   311	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tme.  Why else would Gregor have missed a train! The lad only ever
   312	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthinks about the business.  It nearly makes me cross the way he
   313	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tnever goes out in the evenings; he's been in town for a week now but
   314	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tstayed home every evening.  He sits with us in the kitchen and just
   315	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\treads the paper or studies train timetables.  His idea of relaxation
   316	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tis working with his fretsaw.  He's made a little frame, for
   317	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tinstance, it only took him two or three evenings, you'll be amazed
   318	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thow nice it is; it's hanging up in his room; you'll see it as soon
   319	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tas Gregor opens the door.  Anyway, I'm glad you're here; we wouldn't
   320	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thave been able to get Gregor to open the door by ourselves; he's so
   321	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tstubborn; and I'm sure he isn't well, he said this morning that he
   322	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tis, but he isn't."  "I'll be there in a moment", said Gregor slowly
   323	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tand thoughtfully, but without moving so that he would not miss any
   324	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tword of the conversation.  "Well I can't think of any other way of
   325	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\texplaining it,  Mrs. Samsa", said the chief clerk, "I hope it's
   326	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tnothing serious.  But on the other hand, I must say that if we
   327	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tpeople in commerce ever become slightly unwell then, fortunately or
   328	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tunfortunately as you like, we simply have to overcome it because of
   329	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbusiness considerations."  "Can the chief clerk come in to see you
   330	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tnow then?", asked his father impatiently, knocking at the door
   331	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tagain.  "No", said Gregor.  In the room on his right there followed
   332	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ta painful silence; in the room on his left his sister began to cry.
   333	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
   334	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tSo why did his sister not go and join the others? She had probably
   335	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tonly just got up and had not even begun to get dressed.  And why was
   336	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tshe crying? Was it because he had not got up, and had not let the
   337	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tchief clerk in, because he was in danger of losing his job and if
   338	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthat happened his boss would once more pursue their parents with the
   339	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsame demands as before? There was no need to worry about things like
   340	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthat yet.  Gregor was still there and had not the slightest
   341	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tintention of abandoning his family.  For the time being he just lay
   342	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthere on the carpet, and no-one who knew the condition he was in
   343	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twould seriously have expected him to let the chief clerk in.  It was
   344	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tonly a minor discourtesy, and a suitable excuse could easily be
   345	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfound for it later on, it was not something for which Gregor could
   346	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbe sacked on the spot.  And it seemed to Gregor much more sensible
   347	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tto leave him now in peace instead of disturbing him with talking at
   348	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thim and crying.  But the others didn't know what was happening, they
   349	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twere worried, that would excuse their behaviour.
   350	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
   351	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tThe chief clerk now raised his voice, "Mr. Samsa", he called to him,
   352	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t"what is wrong? You barricade yourself in your room, give us no more
   353	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthan yes or no for an answer, you are causing serious and
   354	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tunnecessary concern to your parents and you fail - and I mention
   355	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthis just by the way - you fail to carry out your business duties in
   356	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ta way that is quite unheard of.  I'm speaking here on behalf of your
   357	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tparents and of your employer, and really must request a clear and
   358	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\timmediate explanation.  I am astonished, quite astonished.  I
   359	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthought I knew you as a calm and sensible person, and now you
   360	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsuddenly seem to be showing off with peculiar whims.  This morning,
   361	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tyour employer did suggest a possible reason for your failure to
   362	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tappear, it's true - it had to do with the money that was recently
   363	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tentrusted to you - but I came near to giving him my word of honour
   364	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthat that could not be the right explanation.  But now that I see
   365	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tyour incomprehensible stubbornness I no longer feel any wish
   366	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twhatsoever to intercede on your behalf.  And nor is your position
   367	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tall that secure.  I had originally intended to say all this to you
   368	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tin private, but since you cause me to waste my time here for no good
   369	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\treason I don't see why your parents should not also learn of it.
   370	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tYour turnover has been very unsatisfactory of late; I grant you that
   371	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tit's not the time of year to do especially good business, we
   372	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\trecognise that; but there simply is no time of year to do no
   373	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbusiness at all,  Mr. Samsa, we cannot allow there to be."
   374	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
   375	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t"But Sir", called Gregor, beside himself and forgetting all else in
   376	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe excitement, "I'll open up immediately, just a moment.  I'm
   377	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tslightly unwell, an attack of dizziness, I haven't been able to get
   378	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tup.  I'm still in bed now.  I'm quite fresh again now, though.  I'm
   379	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tjust getting out of bed.  Just a moment.  Be patient! It's not quite
   380	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tas easy as I'd thought.  I'm quite alright now, though.  It's
   381	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tshocking, what can suddenly happen to a person! I was quite alright
   382	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tlast night, my parents know about it, perhaps better than me, I had
   383	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ta small symptom of it last night already.  They must have noticed
   384	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tit.  I don't know why I didn't let you know at work! But you always
   385	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthink you can get over an illness without staying at home.  Please,
   386	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdon't make my parents suffer! There's no basis for any of the
   387	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\taccusations you're making; nobody's ever said a word to me about any
   388	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tof these things.  Maybe you haven't read the latest contracts I sent
   389	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tin.  I'll set off with the eight o'clock train, as well, these few
   390	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thours of rest have given me strength.  You don't need to wait, sir;
   391	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tI'll be in the office soon after you, and please be so good as to
   392	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ttell that to the boss and recommend me to him!"
   393	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
   394	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tAnd while Gregor gushed out these words, hardly knowing what he was
   395	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsaying, he made his way over to the chest of drawers - this was
   396	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\teasily done, probably because of the practise he had already had in
   397	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbed - where he now tried to get himself upright.  He really did want
   398	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tto open the door, really did want to let them see him and to speak
   399	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twith the chief clerk; the others were being so insistent, and he was
   400	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcurious to learn what they would say when they caught sight of him.
   401	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tIf they were shocked then it would no longer be Gregor's
   402	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tresponsibility and he could rest.  If, however, they took everything
   403	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcalmly he would still have no reason to be upset, and if he hurried
   404	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\the really could be at the station for eight o'clock.  The first few
   405	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ttimes he tried to climb up on the smooth chest of drawers he just
   406	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tslid down again, but he finally gave himself one last swing and
   407	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tstood there upright; the lower part of his body was in serious pain
   408	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbut he no longer gave any attention to it.  Now he let himself fall
   409	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tagainst the back of a nearby chair and held tightly to the edges of
   410	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tit with his little legs.  By now he had also calmed down, and kept
   411	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tquiet so that he could listen to what the chief clerk was saying.
   412	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
   413	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t"Did you understand a word of all that?" the chief clerk asked his
   414	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tparents, "surely he's not trying to make fools of us". "Oh, God!"
   415	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcalled his mother, who was already in tears, "he could be seriously
   416	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\till and we're making him suffer.  Grete! Grete!" she then cried.
   417	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t"Mother?" his sister called from the other side.  They communicated
   418	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tacross Gregor's room.  "You'll have to go for the doctor straight
   419	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\taway.  Gregor is ill.  Quick, get the doctor.  Did you hear the way
   420	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tGregor spoke just now?"  "That was the voice of an animal", said the
   421	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tchief clerk, with a calmness that was in contrast with his mother's
   422	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tscreams.  "Anna! Anna!" his father called into the kitchen through
   423	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe entrance hall, clapping his hands, "get a locksmith here, now!"
   424	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tAnd the two girls, their skirts swishing, immediately ran out
   425	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthrough the hall, wrenching open the front door of the flat as they
   426	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twent.  How had his sister managed to get dressed so quickly? There
   427	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twas no sound of the door banging shut again; they must have left it
   428	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\topen;  people often do in homes where something awful has happened.
   429	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
   430	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tGregor, in contrast, had become much calmer.  So they couldn't
   431	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tunderstand his words any more, although they seemed clear enough to
   432	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thim, clearer than before - perhaps his ears had become used to the
   433	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsound.  They had realised, though, that there was something wrong
   434	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twith him, and were ready to help.  The first response to his
   435	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsituation had been confident and wise, and that made him feel
   436	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbetter.  He felt that he had been drawn back in among people, and
   437	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfrom the doctor and the locksmith he expected great and surprising
   438	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tachievements - although he did not really distinguish one from the
   439	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tother.  Whatever was said next would be crucial, so, in order to
   440	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tmake his voice as clear as possible, he coughed a little, but taking
   441	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcare to do this not too loudly as even this might well sound
   442	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdifferent from the way that a human coughs and he was no longer sure
   443	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\the could judge this for himself.  Meanwhile, it had become very
   444	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tquiet in the next room.  Perhaps his parents were sat at the table
   445	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twhispering with the chief clerk, or perhaps they were all pressed
   446	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tagainst the door and listening.
   447	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
   448	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tGregor slowly pushed his way over to the door with the chair.  Once
   449	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthere he let go of it and threw himself onto the door, holding
   450	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thimself upright against it using the adhesive on the tips of his
   451	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tlegs.  He rested there a little while to recover from the effort
   452	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tinvolved and then set himself to the task of turning the key in the
   453	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tlock with his mouth.  He seemed, unfortunately, to have no proper
   454	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tteeth - how was he, then, to grasp the key? - but the lack of teeth
   455	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twas, of course, made up for with a very strong jaw; using the jaw,
   456	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\the really was able to start the key turning, ignoring the fact that
   457	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\the must have been causing some kind of damage as a brown fluid came
   458	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfrom his mouth, flowed over the key and dripped onto the floor.
   459	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t"Listen", said the chief clerk in the next room, "he's turning the
   460	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tkey."  Gregor was greatly encouraged by this; but they all should
   461	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thave been calling to him, his father and his mother too: "Well done,
   462	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tGregor", they should have cried, "keep at it, keep hold of the
   463	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tlock!"  And with the idea that they were all excitedly following his
   464	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tefforts, he bit on the key with all his strength, paying no
   465	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tattention to the pain he was causing himself.  As the key turned
   466	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tround he turned around the lock with it, only holding himself
   467	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tupright with his mouth, and hung onto the key or pushed it down
   468	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tagain with the whole weight of his body as needed.  The clear sound
   469	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tof the lock as it snapped back was Gregor's sign that he could break
   470	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\this concentration, and as he regained his breath he said to himself:
   471	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t"So, I didn't need the locksmith after all". Then he lay his head on
   472	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe handle of the door to open it completely.
   473	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
   474	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tBecause he had to open the door in this way, it was already wide
   475	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\topen before he could be seen.  He had first to slowly turn himself
   476	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\taround one of the double doors, and he had to do it very carefully
   477	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tif he did not want to fall flat on his back before entering the
   478	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\troom.  He was still occupied with this difficult movement, unable to
   479	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tpay attention to anything else, when he heard the chief clerk
   480	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\texclaim a loud "Oh!", which sounded like the soughing of the wind.
   481	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tNow he also saw him - he was the nearest to the door - his hand
   482	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tpressed against his open mouth and slowly retreating as if driven by
   483	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ta steady and invisible force.  Gregor's mother, her hair still
   484	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdishevelled from bed despite the chief clerk's being there, looked
   485	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tat his father.  Then she unfolded her arms, took two steps forward
   486	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ttowards Gregor and sank down onto the floor into her skirts that
   487	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tspread themselves out around her as her head disappeared down onto
   488	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ther breast.  His father looked hostile, and clenched his fists as if
   489	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twanting to knock Gregor back into his room.  Then he looked
   490	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tuncertainly round the living room, covered his eyes with his hands
   491	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tand wept so that his powerful chest shook.
   492	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
   493	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tSo Gregor did not go into the room, but leant against the inside of
   494	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe other door which was still held bolted in place.  In this way
   495	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tonly half of his body could be seen, along with his head above it
   496	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twhich he leant over to one side as he peered out at the others.
   497	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tMeanwhile the day had become much lighter; part of the endless,
   498	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tgrey-black building on the other side of the street - which was a
   499	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thospital - could be seen quite clearly with the austere and regular
   500	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tline of windows piercing its facade; the rain was still
   501	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfalling, now throwing down large, individual droplets which hit the
   502	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tground one at a time.  The washing up from breakfast lay on the
   503	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ttable; there was so much of it because, for Gregor's father,
   504	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbreakfast was the most important meal of the day and he would
   505	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tstretch it out for several hours as he sat reading a number of
   506	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdifferent newspapers.  On the wall exactly opposite there was
   507	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tphotograph of Gregor when he was a lieutenant in the army, his sword
   508	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tin his hand and a carefree smile on his face as he called forth
   509	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\trespect for his uniform and bearing.  The door to the entrance hall
   510	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twas open and as the front door of the flat was also open he could
   511	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsee onto the landing and the stairs where they began their way down
   512	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbelow.
   513	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
   514	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t"Now, then", said Gregor, well aware that he was the only one to
   515	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thave kept calm, "I'll get dressed straight away now, pack up my
   516	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsamples and set off.  Will you please just let me leave? You can
   517	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsee", he said to the chief clerk, "that I'm not stubborn and I
   518	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tlike to do my job; being a commercial traveller is arduous but
   519	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twithout travelling I couldn't earn my living.  So where are you
   520	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tgoing, in to the office? Yes? Will you report everything accurately,
   521	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthen? It's quite possible for someone to be temporarily unable to
   522	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twork, but that's just the right time to remember what's been
   523	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tachieved in the past and consider that later on, once the difficulty
   524	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thas been removed, he will certainly work with all the more diligence
   525	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tand concentration.  You're well aware that I'm seriously in debt to
   526	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tour employer as well as having to look after my parents and my
   527	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsister, so that I'm trapped in a difficult situation, but I will
   528	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twork my way out of it again.  Please don't make things any harder
   529	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfor me than they are already, and don't take sides against me at the
   530	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\toffice.  I know that nobody likes the travellers.  They think we
   531	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tearn an enormous wage as well as having a soft time of it.  That's
   532	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tjust prejudice but they have no particular reason to think better of
   533	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tit.  But you, sir, you have a better overview than the rest of the
   534	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tstaff, in fact, if I can say this in confidence, a better overview
   535	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthan the boss himself - it's very easy for a businessman like him to
   536	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tmake mistakes about his employees and judge them more harshly than
   537	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\the should.  And you're also well aware that we travellers spend
   538	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\talmost the whole year away from the office, so that we can very
   539	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\teasily fall victim to gossip and chance and groundless complaints,
   540	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tand it's almost impossible to defend yourself from that sort of
   541	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthing, we don't usually even hear about them, or if at all it's when
   542	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twe arrive back home exhausted from a trip, and that's when we feel
   543	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe harmful effects of what's been going on without even knowing
   544	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twhat caused them.  Please, don't go away, at least first say
   545	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsomething to show that you grant that I'm at least partly right!"
   546	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
   547	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tBut the chief clerk had turned away as soon as Gregor had started to
   548	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tspeak, and, with protruding lips, only stared back at him over his
   549	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ttrembling shoulders as he left.  He did not keep still for a moment
   550	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twhile Gregor was speaking, but moved steadily towards the door
   551	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twithout taking his eyes off him.  He moved very gradually, as if
   552	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthere had been some secret prohibition on leaving the room.  It was
   553	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tonly when he had reached the entrance hall that he made a sudden
   554	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tmovement, drew his foot from the living room, and rushed forward in
   555	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ta panic.  In the hall, he stretched his right hand far out towards
   556	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe stairway as if out there, there were some supernatural force
   557	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twaiting to save him.
   558	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
   559	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tGregor realised that it was out of the question to let the chief
   560	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tclerk go away in this mood if his position in the firm was not to be
   561	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tput into extreme danger.  That was something his parents did not
   562	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tunderstand very well; over the years, they had become convinced that
   563	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthis job would provide for Gregor for his entire life, and besides,
   564	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthey had so much to worry about at present that they had lost sight
   565	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tof any thought for the future.  Gregor, though, did think about the
   566	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfuture.  The chief clerk had to be held back, calmed down, convinced
   567	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tand finally won over; the future of Gregor and his family depended
   568	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ton it! If only his sister were here! She was clever; she was already
   569	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tin tears while Gregor was still lying peacefully on his back.  And
   570	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe chief clerk was a lover of women, surely she could persuade him;
   571	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tshe would close the front door in the entrance hall and talk him out
   572	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tof his shocked state.  But his sister was not there, Gregor would
   573	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thave to do the job himself.  And without considering that he still
   574	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twas not familiar with how well he could move about in his present
   575	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tstate, or that his speech still might not - or probably would not -
   576	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbe understood, he let go of the door; pushed himself through the
   577	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\topening; tried to reach the chief clerk on the landing who,
   578	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tridiculously, was holding on to the banister with both hands; but
   579	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tGregor fell immediately over and, with a little scream as he sought
   580	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsomething to hold onto, landed on his numerous little legs.  Hardly
   581	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thad that happened than, for the first time that day, he began to
   582	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfeel alright with his body; the little legs had the solid ground
   583	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tunder them; to his pleasure, they did exactly as he told them; they
   584	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twere even making the effort to carry him where he wanted to go; and
   585	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\the was soon believing that all his sorrows would soon be finally at
   586	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tan end.  He held back the urge to move but swayed from side to side
   587	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tas he crouched there on the floor.  His mother was not far away in
   588	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfront of him and seemed, at first, quite engrossed in herself, but
   589	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthen she suddenly jumped up with her arms outstretched and her
   590	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfingers spread shouting: "Help, for pity's sake, Help!"  The way she
   591	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\theld her head suggested she wanted to see Gregor better, but the
   592	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tunthinking way she was hurrying backwards showed that she did not;
   593	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tshe had forgotten that the table was behind her with all the
   594	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbreakfast things on it; when she reached the table she sat quickly
   595	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdown on it without knowing what she was doing; without even seeming
   596	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tto notice that the coffee pot had been knocked over and a gush of
   597	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcoffee was pouring down onto the carpet.
   598	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
   599	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t"Mother, mother", said Gregor gently, looking up at her.  He had
   600	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcompletely forgotten the chief clerk for the moment, but could not
   601	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thelp himself snapping in the air with his jaws at the sight of the
   602	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tflow of coffee.  That set his mother screaming anew, she fled from
   603	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe table and into the arms of his father as he rushed towards her.
   604	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tGregor, though, had no time to spare for his parents now; the chief
   605	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tclerk had already reached the stairs; with his chin on the banister,
   606	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\the looked back for the last time.  Gregor made a run for him; he
   607	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twanted to be sure of reaching him; the chief clerk must have
   608	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\texpected something, as he leapt down several steps at once and
   609	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdisappeared; his shouts resounding all around the staircase.  The
   610	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tflight of the chief clerk seemed, unfortunately, to put Gregor's
   611	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfather into a panic as well.  Until then he had been relatively self
   612	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcontrolled, but now, instead of running after the chief clerk
   613	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thimself, or at least not impeding Gregor as he ran after him,
   614	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tGregor's father seized the chief clerk's stick in his right hand
   615	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t(the chief clerk had left it behind on a chair, along with his hat
   616	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tand overcoat), picked up a large newspaper from the table with his
   617	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tleft, and used them to drive Gregor back into his room, stamping his
   618	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfoot at him as he went.  Gregor's appeals to his father were of no
   619	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thelp, his appeals were simply not understood, however much he humbly
   620	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tturned his head his father merely stamped his foot all the harder.
   621	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tAcross the room, despite the chilly weather, Gregor's mother had
   622	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tpulled open a window, leant far out of it and pressed her hands to
   623	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ther face.  A strong draught of air flew in from the street towards
   624	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe stairway, the curtains flew up, the newspapers on the table
   625	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfluttered and some of them were blown onto the floor.  Nothing would
   626	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tstop Gregor's father as he drove him back, making hissing noises at
   627	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thim like a wild man.  Gregor had never had any practice in moving
   628	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbackwards and was only able to go very slowly.  If Gregor had only
   629	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbeen allowed to turn round he would have been back in his room
   630	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tstraight away, but he was afraid that if he took the time to do that
   631	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\this father would become impatient, and there was the threat of a
   632	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tlethal blow to his back or head from the stick in his father's hand
   633	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tany moment.  Eventually, though, Gregor realised that he had no
   634	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tchoice as he saw, to his disgust, that he was quite incapable of
   635	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tgoing backwards in a straight line; so he began, as quickly as
   636	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tpossible and with frequent anxious glances at his father, to turn
   637	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thimself round.  It went very slowly, but perhaps his father was able
   638	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tto see his good intentions as he did nothing to hinder him, in fact
   639	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tnow and then he used the tip of his stick to give directions from a
   640	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdistance as to which way to turn.  If only his father would stop
   641	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthat unbearable hissing! It was making Gregor quite confused.  When
   642	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\the had nearly finished turning round, still listening to that
   643	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thissing, he made a mistake and turned himself back a little the way
   644	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\the had just come.  He was pleased when he finally had his head in
   645	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfront of the doorway, but then saw that it was too narrow, and his
   646	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbody was too broad to get through it without further difficulty.  In
   647	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\this present mood, it obviously did not occur to his father to open
   648	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe other of the double doors so that Gregor would have enough space
   649	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tto get through.  He was merely fixed on the idea that Gregor should
   650	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbe got back into his room as quickly as possible.  Nor would he ever
   651	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thave allowed Gregor the time to get himself upright as preparation
   652	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfor getting through the doorway.  What he did, making more noise
   653	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthan ever, was to drive Gregor forwards all the harder as if there
   654	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thad been nothing in the way; it sounded to Gregor as if there was
   655	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tnow more than one father behind him; it was not a pleasant
   656	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\texperience, and Gregor pushed himself into the doorway without
   657	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tregard for what might happen.  One side of his body lifted itself,
   658	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\the lay at an angle in the doorway, one flank scraped on the white
   659	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdoor and was painfully injured, leaving vile brown flecks on it,
   660	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsoon he was stuck fast and would not have been able to move at all
   661	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tby himself, the little legs along one side hung quivering in the air
   662	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twhile those on the other side were pressed painfully against the
   663	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tground.  Then his father gave him a hefty shove from behind which
   664	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\treleased him from where he was held and sent him flying, and heavily
   665	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbleeding, deep into his room.  The door was slammed shut with the
   666	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tstick, then, finally, all was quiet.
   667	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
   668	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
   669	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
   670	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tII
   671	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
   672	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
   673	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tIt was not until it was getting dark that evening that Gregor awoke
   674	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfrom his deep and coma-like sleep.  He would have woken soon
   675	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tafterwards anyway even if he hadn't been disturbed, as he had had
   676	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tenough sleep and felt fully rested.  But he had the impression that
   677	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsome hurried steps and the sound of the door leading into the front
   678	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\troom being carefully shut had woken him.  The light from the
   679	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\telectric street lamps shone palely here and there onto the ceiling
   680	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tand tops of the furniture, but down below, where Gregor was, it was
   681	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdark.  He pushed himself over to the door, feeling his way clumsily
   682	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twith his antennae - of which he was now beginning to learn the value
   683	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t- in order to see what had been happening there.  The whole of his
   684	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tleft side seemed like one, painfully stretched scar,  and he limped
   685	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbadly on his two rows of legs.  One of the legs had been badly
   686	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tinjured in the events of that morning - it was nearly a miracle that
   687	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tonly one of them had been - and dragged along lifelessly.
   688	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
   689	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tIt was only when he had reached the door that he realised what it
   690	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tactually was that had drawn him over to it; it was the smell of
   691	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsomething to eat.  By the door there was a dish filled with
   692	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsweetened milk with little pieces of white bread floating in it.  He
   693	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twas so pleased he almost laughed, as he was even hungrier than he
   694	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thad been that morning, and immediately dipped his head into the
   695	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tmilk, nearly covering his eyes with it.  But he soon drew his head
   696	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tback again in disappointment; not only did the pain in his tender
   697	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tleft side make it difficult to eat the food - he was only able to
   698	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\teat if his whole body worked together as a snuffling whole - but the
   699	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tmilk did not taste at all nice.  Milk like this was normally his
   700	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfavourite drink, and his sister had certainly left it there for him
   701	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbecause of that, but he turned, almost against his own will, away
   702	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfrom the dish and crawled back into the centre of the room.
   703	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
   704	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tThrough the crack in the door, Gregor could see that the gas had
   705	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbeen lit in the living room.  His father at this time would normally
   706	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbe sat with his evening paper, reading it out in a loud voice to
   707	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tGregor's mother, and sometimes to his sister, but there was now not
   708	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ta sound to be heard.  Gregor's sister would often write and tell him
   709	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tabout this reading, but maybe his father had lost the habit in
   710	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\trecent times.  It was so quiet all around too, even though there
   711	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tmust have been somebody in the flat.  "What a quiet life it is the
   712	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfamily lead", said Gregor to himself, and, gazing into the darkness,
   713	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfelt a great pride that he was able to provide a life like that in
   714	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsuch a nice home for his sister and parents.  But what now, if all
   715	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthis peace and wealth and comfort should come to a horrible and
   716	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfrightening end? That was something that Gregor did not want to
   717	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthink about too much, so he started to move about, crawling up and
   718	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdown the room.
   719	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
   720	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tOnce during that long evening, the door on one side of the room was
   721	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\topened very slightly and hurriedly closed again; later on the door
   722	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ton the other side did the same; it seemed that someone needed to
   723	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tenter the room but thought better of it.  Gregor went and waited
   724	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\timmediately by the door, resolved either to bring the timorous
   725	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tvisitor into the room in some way or at least to find out who it
   726	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twas; but the door was opened no more that night and Gregor waited in
   727	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tvain.  The previous morning while the doors were locked everyone had
   728	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twanted to get in there to him, but now, now that he had opened up
   729	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tone of the doors and the other had clearly been unlocked some time
   730	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tduring the day, no-one came, and the keys were in the other sides.
   731	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
   732	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tIt was not until late at night that the gaslight in the living room
   733	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twas put out, and now it was easy to see that his parents and sister had
   734	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tstayed awake all that time, as they all could be distinctly heard as
   735	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthey went away together on tip-toe.  It was clear that no-one would
   736	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcome into Gregor's room any more until morning; that gave him plenty
   737	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tof time to think undisturbed about how he would have to re-arrange
   738	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\this life.  For some reason, the tall, empty room where he was forced
   739	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tto remain made him feel uneasy as he lay there flat on the floor,
   740	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\teven though he had been living in it for five years.  Hardly aware
   741	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tof what he was doing other than a slight feeling of shame, he
   742	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thurried under the couch.  It pressed down on his back a little, and
   743	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\the was no longer able to lift his head, but he nonetheless felt
   744	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\timmediately at ease and his only regret was that his body was too
   745	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbroad to get it all underneath.
   746	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
   747	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tHe spent the whole night there.  Some of the time he passed in a
   748	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tlight sleep, although he frequently woke from it in alarm because of
   749	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\this hunger, and some of the time was spent in worries and vague
   750	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thopes which, however, always led to the same conclusion: for the
   751	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ttime being he must remain calm, he must show patience and the
   752	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tgreatest consideration so that his family could bear the
   753	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tunpleasantness that he, in his present condition, was forced to
   754	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\timpose on them.
   755	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
   756	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tGregor soon had the opportunity to test the strength of his
   757	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdecisions, as early the next morning, almost before the night had
   758	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tended, his sister, nearly fully dressed, opened the door from the
   759	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfront room and looked anxiously in.  She did not see him straight
   760	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\taway, but when she did notice him under the couch - he had to be
   761	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsomewhere, for God's sake, he couldn't have flown away - she was so
   762	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tshocked that she lost control of herself and slammed the door shut
   763	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tagain from outside.  But she seemed to regret her behaviour, as she
   764	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\topened the door again straight away and came in on tip-toe as if
   765	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tentering the room of someone seriously ill or even of a stranger.
   766	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tGregor had pushed his head forward, right to the edge of the couch,
   767	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tand watched her.  Would she notice that he had left the milk as it
   768	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twas, realise that it was not from any lack of hunger and bring him
   769	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tin some other food that was more suitable? If she didn't do it
   770	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\therself he would rather go hungry than draw her attention to it,
   771	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\talthough he did feel a terrible urge to rush forward from under the
   772	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcouch, throw himself at his sister's feet and beg her for something
   773	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tgood to eat.  However, his sister noticed the full dish immediately
   774	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tand looked at it and the few drops of milk splashed around it with
   775	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsome surprise.  She immediately picked it up - using a rag,
   776	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tnot her bare hands - and carried it out.  Gregor was extremely
   777	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcurious as to what she would bring in its place, imagining the
   778	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twildest possibilities, but he never could have guessed what his
   779	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsister, in her goodness, actually did bring.  In order to test his
   780	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ttaste, she brought him a whole selection of things, all spread out
   781	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ton an old newspaper.  There were old, half-rotten vegetables; bones
   782	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfrom the evening meal, covered in white sauce that had gone hard; a
   783	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfew raisins and almonds; some cheese that Gregor had declared
   784	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tinedible two days before; a dry roll and some bread spread with
   785	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbutter and salt.  As well as all that she had poured some water into
   786	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe dish, which had probably been permanently set aside for Gregor's
   787	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tuse, and placed it beside them.  Then, out of consideration for
   788	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tGregor's feelings, as she knew that he would not eat in front of
   789	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ther, she hurried out again and even turned the key in the lock so
   790	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthat Gregor would know he could make things as comfortable for
   791	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thimself as he liked.  Gregor's little legs whirred, at last he could
   792	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\teat.  What's more, his injuries must already have completely healed
   793	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tas he found no difficulty in moving.  This amazed him, as more than
   794	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ta month earlier he had cut his finger slightly with a knife, he
   795	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthought of how his finger had still hurt the day before yesterday.
   796	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t"Am I less sensitive than I used to be, then?", he thought, and was
   797	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\talready sucking greedily at the cheese which had immediately, almost
   798	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcompellingly, attracted him much more than the other foods on the
   799	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tnewspaper.  Quickly one after another, his eyes watering with
   800	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tpleasure, he consumed the cheese, the vegetables and the sauce; the
   801	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfresh foods, on the other hand, he didn't like at all, and even
   802	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdragged the things he did want to eat a little way away from them
   803	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbecause he couldn't stand the smell.  Long after he had finished
   804	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\teating and lay lethargic in the same place, his sister slowly turned
   805	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe key in the lock as a sign to him that he should withdraw.  He
   806	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twas immediately startled, although he had been half asleep, and he
   807	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thurried back under the couch.  But he needed great self-control to
   808	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tstay there even for the short time that his sister was in the room,
   809	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tas eating so much food had rounded out his body a little and he
   810	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcould hardly breathe in that narrow space.  Half suffocating, he
   811	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twatched with bulging eyes as his sister unselfconsciously took a
   812	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbroom and swept up the left-overs, mixing them in with the food he
   813	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thad not even touched at all as if it could not be used any more.
   814	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tShe quickly dropped it all into a bin, closed it with its wooden
   815	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tlid, and carried everything out.  She had hardly turned her back
   816	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbefore Gregor came out again from under the couch and stretched
   817	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thimself.
   818	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
   819	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tThis was how Gregor received his food each day now, once in the
   820	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tmorning while his parents and the maid were still asleep, and the
   821	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsecond time after everyone had eaten their meal at midday as his
   822	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tparents would sleep for a little while then as well, and Gregor's
   823	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsister would send the maid away on some errand.  Gregor's father and
   824	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tmother certainly did not want him to starve either, but perhaps it
   825	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twould have been more than they could stand to have any more
   826	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\texperience of his feeding than being told about it, and perhaps his
   827	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsister wanted to spare them what distress she could as they were
   828	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tindeed suffering enough.
   829	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
   830	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tIt was impossible for Gregor to find out what they had told the
   831	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdoctor and the locksmith that first morning to get them out of the
   832	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tflat.  As nobody could understand him, nobody, not even his sister,
   833	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthought that he could understand them, so he had to be content to
   834	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thear his sister's sighs and appeals to the saints as she moved about
   835	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\this room.  It was only later, when she had become a little more used
   836	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tto everything - there was, of course, no question of her ever
   837	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbecoming fully used to the situation - that Gregor would sometimes
   838	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcatch a friendly comment, or at least a comment that could be
   839	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tconstrued as friendly.  "He's enjoyed his dinner today", she might
   840	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsay when he had diligently cleared away all the food left for him,
   841	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tor if he left most of it, which slowly became more and more
   842	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfrequent, she would often say, sadly, "now everything's just been
   843	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tleft there again".
   844	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
   845	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tAlthough Gregor wasn't able to hear any news directly he did listen
   846	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tto much of what was said in the next rooms, and whenever he heard
   847	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tanyone speaking he would scurry straight to the appropriate door and
   848	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tpress his whole body against it.  There was seldom any conversation,
   849	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tespecially at first, that was not about him in some way, even if
   850	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tonly in secret.  For two whole days, all the talk at every mealtime
   851	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twas about what they should do now; but even between meals they spoke
   852	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tabout the same subject as there were always at least two members of
   853	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe family at home - nobody wanted to be at home by themselves and
   854	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tit was out of the question to leave the flat entirely empty.  And on
   855	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe very first day the maid had fallen to her knees and begged
   856	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tGregor's mother to let her go without delay.  It was not very clear
   857	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thow much she knew of what had happened but she left within a quarter
   858	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tof an hour, tearfully thanking Gregor's mother for her dismissal as
   859	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tif she had done her an enormous service.  She even swore
   860	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\temphatically not to tell anyone the slightest about what had
   861	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thappened, even though no-one had asked that of her.
   862	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
   863	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tNow Gregor's sister also had to help his mother with the cooking;
   864	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\talthough that was not so much bother as no-one ate very much.
   865	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tGregor often heard how one of them would unsuccessfully urge another
   866	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tto eat, and receive no more answer than "no thanks, I've had enough"
   867	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tor something similar.  No-one drank very much either.  His sister
   868	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twould sometimes ask his father whether he would like a beer, hoping
   869	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfor the chance to go and fetch it herself.  When his father then
   870	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsaid nothing she would add, so that he would not feel selfish, that
   871	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tshe could send the housekeeper for it, but then his father would
   872	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tclose the matter with a big, loud "No", and no more would be said.
   873	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
   874	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tEven before the first day had come to an end, his father had
   875	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\texplained to Gregor's mother and sister what their finances and
   876	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tprospects were.  Now and then he stood up from the table and took
   877	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsome receipt or document from the little cash box he had saved from
   878	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\this business when it had collapsed five years earlier.  Gregor heard
   879	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thow he opened the complicated lock and then closed it again after he
   880	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thad taken the item he wanted.  What he heard his father say was some
   881	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tof the first good news that Gregor heard since he had first been
   882	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tincarcerated in his room.  He had thought that nothing at all
   883	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tremained from his father's business, at least he had never told him
   884	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tanything different, and Gregor had never asked him about it anyway.
   885	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tTheir business misfortune had reduced the family to a state of total
   886	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdespair, and Gregor's only concern at that time had been to arrange
   887	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthings so that they could all forget about it as quickly as
   888	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tpossible.  So then he started working especially hard, with a fiery
   889	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tvigour that raised him from a junior salesman to a travelling
   890	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\trepresentative almost overnight, bringing with it the chance to earn
   891	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tmoney in quite different ways.  Gregor converted his success at work
   892	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tstraight into cash that he could lay on the table at home for the
   893	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbenefit of his astonished and delighted family.  They had been good
   894	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ttimes and they had never come again, at least not with the same
   895	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsplendour, even though Gregor had later earned so much that he was
   896	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tin a position to bear the costs of the whole family, and did bear
   897	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthem.  They had even got used to it, both Gregor and the family,
   898	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthey took the money with gratitude and he was glad to provide it,
   899	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\talthough there was no longer much warm affection given in return.
   900	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tGregor only remained close to his sister now.  Unlike him, she was
   901	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tvery fond of music and a gifted and expressive violinist, it was his
   902	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsecret plan to send her to the conservatory next year even though it
   903	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twould cause great expense that would have to be made up for in some
   904	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tother way.  During Gregor's short periods in town, conversation with
   905	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\this sister would often turn to the conservatory but it was only ever
   906	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tmentioned as a lovely dream that could never be realised.  Their
   907	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tparents did not like to hear this innocent talk, but Gregor thought
   908	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tabout it quite hard and decided he would let them know what he
   909	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tplanned with a grand announcement of it on Christmas day.
   910	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
   911	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tThat was the sort of totally pointless thing that went through his
   912	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tmind in his present state, pressed upright against the door and
   913	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tlistening.  There were times when he simply became too tired to
   914	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcontinue listening, when his head would fall wearily against the
   915	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdoor and he would pull it up again with a start, as even the
   916	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tslightest noise he caused would be heard next door and they would
   917	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tall go silent.  "What's that he's doing now", his father would say
   918	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tafter a while, clearly having gone over to the door, and only then
   919	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twould the interrupted conversation slowly be taken up again.
   920	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
   921	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tWhen explaining things, his father repeated himself several times,
   922	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tpartly because it was a long time since he had been occupied with
   923	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthese matters himself and partly because Gregor's mother did not
   924	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tunderstand everything the first time.  From these repeated explanations
   925	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tGregor learned, to his pleasure, that despite all their misfortunes
   926	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthere was still some money available from the old days.  It was not
   927	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ta lot, but it had not been touched in the meantime and some interest
   928	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thad accumulated.  Besides that, they had not been using up all the
   929	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tmoney that Gregor had been bringing home every month, keeping only a
   930	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tlittle for himself, so that that, too, had been accumulating.
   931	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tBehind the door, Gregor nodded with enthusiasm in his pleasure at
   932	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthis unexpected thrift and caution.  He could actually have used
   933	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthis surplus money to reduce his father's debt to his boss, and the
   934	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tday when he could have freed himself from that job would have come
   935	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tmuch closer, but now it was certainly better the way his father had
   936	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdone things.
   937	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
   938	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tThis money, however, was certainly not enough to enable the family
   939	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tto live off the interest; it was enough to maintain them for,
   940	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tperhaps, one or two years, no more.  That's to say, it was money
   941	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthat should not really be touched but set aside for emergencies;
   942	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tmoney to live on had to be earned.  His father was healthy but old,
   943	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tand lacking in self confidence.  During the five years that he had
   944	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tnot been working - the first holiday in a life that had been full of
   945	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tstrain and no success - he had put on a lot of weight and become
   946	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tvery slow and clumsy.  Would Gregor's elderly mother now have to go
   947	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tand earn money? She suffered from asthma and it was a strain for her
   948	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tjust to move about the home, every other day would be spent
   949	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tstruggling for breath on the sofa by the open window.  Would his
   950	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsister have to go and earn money? She was still a child of
   951	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tseventeen, her life up till then had been very enviable, consisting
   952	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tof wearing nice clothes, sleeping late, helping out in the business,
   953	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tjoining in with a few modest pleasures and most of all playing the
   954	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tviolin.  Whenever they began to talk of the need to earn money,
   955	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tGregor would always first let go of the door and then throw himself
   956	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tonto the cool, leather sofa next to it, as he became quite hot with
   957	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tshame and regret.
   958	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
   959	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tHe would often lie there the whole night through, not sleeping a
   960	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twink but scratching at the leather for hours on end.  Or he might go
   961	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tto all the effort of pushing a chair to the window, climbing up onto
   962	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe sill and, propped up in the chair, leaning on the window to
   963	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tstare out of it.  He had used to feel a great sense of freedom from
   964	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdoing this, but doing it now was obviously something more remembered
   965	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthan experienced,  as what he actually saw in this way was becoming
   966	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tless distinct every day, even things that were quite near; he had
   967	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tused to curse the ever-present view of the hospital across the
   968	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tstreet, but now he could not see it at all, and if he had not known
   969	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthat he lived in Charlottenstrasse, which was a quiet street despite
   970	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbeing in the middle of the city, he could have thought that he was
   971	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tlooking out the window at a barren waste where the grey sky and the
   972	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tgrey earth mingled inseparably.  His observant sister only needed to
   973	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tnotice the chair twice before she would always push it back to its
   974	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\texact position by the window after she had tidied up the room, and
   975	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\teven left the inner pane of the window open from then on.
   976	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
   977	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tIf Gregor had only been able to speak to his sister and thank her
   978	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfor all that she had to do for him it would have been easier for him
   979	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tto bear it; but as it was it caused him pain.  His sister,
   980	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tnaturally, tried as far as possible to pretend there was nothing
   981	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tburdensome about it, and the longer it went on, of course, the
   982	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbetter she was able to do so, but as time went by Gregor was also
   983	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\table to see through it all so much better.  It had even become very
   984	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tunpleasant for him, now, whenever she entered the room.  No sooner
   985	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thad she come in than she would quickly close the door as a
   986	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tprecaution so that no-one would have to suffer the view into
   987	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tGregor's room, then she would go straight to the window and pull it
   988	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thurriedly open almost as if she were suffocating.  Even if it was
   989	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcold, she would stay at the window breathing deeply for a little
   990	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twhile.  She would alarm Gregor twice a day with this running about
   991	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tand noise making; he would stay under the couch shivering the whole
   992	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twhile, knowing full well that she would certainly have liked to
   993	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tspare him this ordeal, but it was impossible for her to be in the
   994	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsame room with him with the windows closed.
   995	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
   996	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tOne day, about a month after Gregor's transformation when his sister
   997	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tno longer had any particular reason to be shocked at his appearance,
   998	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tshe came into the room a little earlier than usual and found him
   999	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tstill staring out the window, motionless, and just where he would be
  1000	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tmost horrible.  In itself, his sister's not coming into the room
  1001	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twould have been no surprise for Gregor as it would have been
  1002	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdifficult for her to immediately open the window while he was still
  1003	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthere, but not only did she not come in, she went straight back and
  1004	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tclosed the door behind her, a stranger would have thought he had
  1005	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthreatened her and tried to bite her.  Gregor went straight to hide
  1006	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thimself under the couch, of course, but he had to wait until midday
  1007	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbefore his sister came back and she seemed much more uneasy than
  1008	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tusual.  It made him realise that she still found his appearance
  1009	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tunbearable and would continue to do so, she probably even had to
  1010	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tovercome the urge to flee when she saw the little bit of him that
  1011	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tprotruded from under the couch.  One day, in order to spare her even
  1012	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthis sight, he spent four hours carrying the bedsheet over to the
  1013	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcouch on his back and arranged it so that he was completely covered
  1014	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tand his sister would not be able to see him even if she bent down.
  1015	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tIf she did not think this sheet was necessary then all she had to do
  1016	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twas take it off again, as it was clear enough that it was no
  1017	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tpleasure for Gregor to cut himself off so completely.  She left the
  1018	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsheet where it was.  Gregor even thought he glimpsed a look of
  1019	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tgratitude one time when he carefully looked out from under the sheet
  1020	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tto see how his sister liked the new arrangement.
  1021	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1022	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tFor the first fourteen days, Gregor's parents could not bring
  1023	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthemselves to come into the room to see him.  He would often hear
  1024	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthem say how they appreciated all the new work his sister was doing
  1025	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\teven though, before, they had seen her as a girl who was somewhat
  1026	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tuseless and frequently been annoyed with her.  But now the two of
  1027	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthem, father and mother, would often both wait outside the door of
  1028	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tGregor's room while his sister tidied up in there, and as soon as
  1029	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tshe went out again she would have to tell them exactly how
  1030	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\teverything looked, what Gregor had eaten, how he had behaved this
  1031	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ttime and whether, perhaps, any slight improvement could be seen.
  1032	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tHis mother also wanted to go in and visit Gregor relatively soon but
  1033	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\this father and sister at first persuaded her against it.  Gregor
  1034	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tlistened very closely to all this, and approved fully.  Later,
  1035	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthough, she had to be held back by force, which made her call out:
  1036	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t"Let me go and see Gregor, he is my unfortunate son! Can't you
  1037	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tunderstand I have to see him?", and Gregor would think to himself
  1038	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthat maybe it would be better if his mother came in, not every day
  1039	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tof course, but one day a week, perhaps; she could understand
  1040	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\teverything much better than his sister who, for all her courage, was
  1041	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tstill just a child after all, and really might not have had an
  1042	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tadult's appreciation of the burdensome job she had taken on.
  1043	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1044	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tGregor's wish to see his mother was soon realised.  Out of
  1045	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tconsideration for his parents, Gregor wanted to avoid being seen at
  1046	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe window during the day, the few square meters of the floor did
  1047	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tnot give him much room to crawl about, it was hard to just lie
  1048	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tquietly through the night, his food soon stopped giving him any
  1049	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tpleasure at all, and so, to entertain himself, he got into the habit
  1050	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tof crawling up and down the walls and ceiling.  He was especially
  1051	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfond of hanging from the ceiling; it was quite different from lying
  1052	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ton the floor; he could breathe more freely; his body had a light
  1053	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tswing to it; and up there, relaxed and almost happy, it might happen
  1054	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthat he would surprise even himself by letting go of the ceiling and
  1055	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tlanding on the floor with a crash.  But now, of course, he had far
  1056	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbetter control of his body than before and, even with a fall as
  1057	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tgreat as that, caused himself no damage.  Very soon his sister
  1058	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tnoticed Gregor's new way of entertaining himself - he had, after
  1059	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tall, left traces of the adhesive from his feet as he crawled about -
  1060	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tand got it into her head to make it as easy as possible for him by
  1061	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tremoving the furniture that got in his way, especially the chest of
  1062	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdrawers and the desk.  Now, this was not something that she would be
  1063	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\table to do by herself; she did not dare to ask for help from her
  1064	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfather; the sixteen year old maid had carried on bravely since the
  1065	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcook had left but she certainly would not have helped in this, she
  1066	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thad even asked to be allowed to keep the kitchen locked at all times
  1067	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tand never to have to open the door unless it was especially
  1068	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\timportant; so his sister had no choice but to choose some time when
  1069	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tGregor's father was not there and fetch his mother to help her.  As
  1070	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tshe approached the room, Gregor could hear his mother express her
  1071	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tjoy, but once at the door she went silent.  First, of course, his
  1072	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsister came in and looked round to see that everything in the room
  1073	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twas alright; and only then did she let her mother enter.  Gregor had
  1074	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thurriedly pulled the sheet down lower over the couch and put more
  1075	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfolds into it so that everything really looked as if it had just
  1076	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbeen thrown down by chance.  Gregor also refrained, this time, from
  1077	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tspying out from under the sheet; he gave up the chance to see his
  1078	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tmother until later and was simply glad that she had come.  "You can
  1079	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcome in, he can't be seen", said his sister, obviously leading her
  1080	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tin by the hand.  The old chest of drawers was too heavy for a pair
  1081	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tof feeble women to be heaving about, but Gregor listened as they
  1082	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tpushed it from its place, his sister always taking on the heaviest
  1083	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tpart of the work for herself and ignoring her mother's warnings that
  1084	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tshe would strain herself.  This lasted a very long time.  After
  1085	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tlabouring at it for fifteen minutes or more his mother said it would
  1086	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbe better to leave the chest where it was, for one thing it was too
  1087	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\theavy for them to get the job finished before Gregor's father got
  1088	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thome and leaving it in the middle of the room it would be in his way
  1089	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\teven more, and for another thing it wasn't even sure that taking the
  1090	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfurniture away would really be any help to him.  She thought just
  1091	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe opposite; the sight of the bare walls saddened her right to her
  1092	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\theart; and why wouldn't Gregor feel the same way about it, he'd been
  1093	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tused to this furniture in his room for a long time and it would make
  1094	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thim feel abandoned to be in an empty room like that.  Then, quietly,
  1095	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\talmost whispering as if wanting Gregor (whose whereabouts she did
  1096	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tnot know) to hear not even the tone of her voice, as she was
  1097	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tconvinced that he did not understand her words, she added "and by
  1098	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ttaking the furniture away, won't it seem like we're showing that
  1099	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twe've given up all hope of improvement and we're abandoning him to
  1100	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcope for himself? I think it'd be best to leave the room exactly the
  1101	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tway it was before so that when Gregor comes back to us again he'll
  1102	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfind everything unchanged and he'll be able to forget the time in
  1103	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbetween all the easier".
  1104	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1105	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tHearing these words from his mother made Gregor realise that the
  1106	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tlack of any direct human communication, along with the monotonous
  1107	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tlife led by the family during these two months, must have made him
  1108	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tconfused - he could think of no other way of explaining to himself
  1109	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twhy he had seriously wanted his room emptied out.  Had he really
  1110	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twanted to transform his room into a cave, a warm room fitted out
  1111	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twith the nice furniture he had inherited? That would have let him
  1112	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcrawl around unimpeded in any direction, but it would also have let
  1113	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thim quickly forget his past when he had still been human.  He had
  1114	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcome very close to forgetting, and it had only been the voice of his
  1115	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tmother, unheard for so long, that had shaken him out of it.  Nothing
  1116	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tshould be removed; everything had to stay; he could not do without
  1117	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe good influence the furniture had on his condition; and if the
  1118	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfurniture made it difficult for him to crawl about mindlessly that
  1119	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twas not a loss but a great advantage.
  1120	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1121	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tHis sister, unfortunately, did not agree; she had become used to the
  1122	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tidea, not without reason, that she was Gregor's spokesman to his
  1123	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tparents about the things that concerned him.  This meant that his
  1124	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tmother's advice now was sufficient reason for her to insist on
  1125	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tremoving not only the chest of drawers and the desk, as she had
  1126	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthought at first, but all the furniture apart from the all-important
  1127	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcouch.  It was more than childish perversity, of course, or the
  1128	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tunexpected confidence she had recently acquired, that made her
  1129	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tinsist; she had indeed noticed that Gregor needed a lot of room to
  1130	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcrawl about in, whereas the furniture, as far as anyone could see,
  1131	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twas of no use to him at all.  Girls of that age, though, do become
  1132	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tenthusiastic about things and feel they must get their way whenever
  1133	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthey can.  Perhaps this was what tempted Grete to make Gregor's
  1134	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsituation seem even more shocking than it was so that she could do
  1135	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\teven more for him.  Grete would probably be the only one who would
  1136	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdare enter a room dominated by Gregor crawling about the bare walls
  1137	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tby himself.
  1138	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1139	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tSo she refused to let her mother dissuade her.  Gregor's mother
  1140	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\talready looked uneasy in his room, she soon stopped speaking and
  1141	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thelped Gregor's sister to get the chest of drawers out with what
  1142	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tstrength she had.  The chest of drawers was something that Gregor
  1143	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcould do without if he had to, but the writing desk had to stay.
  1144	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tHardly had the two women pushed the chest of drawers, groaning, out
  1145	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tof the room than Gregor poked his head out from under the couch to
  1146	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsee what he could do about it.  He meant to be as careful and
  1147	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tconsiderate as he could, but, unfortunately, it was his mother who
  1148	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcame back first while Grete in the next room had her arms round the
  1149	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tchest, pushing and pulling at it from side to side by herself
  1150	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twithout, of course, moving it an inch.  His mother was not used to
  1151	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe sight of Gregor, he might have made her ill, so Gregor hurried
  1152	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbackwards to the far end of the couch.  In his startlement, though,
  1153	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\the was not able to prevent the sheet at its front from moving a
  1154	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tlittle.  It was enough to attract his mother's attention.  She stood
  1155	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tvery still, remained there a moment, and then went back out to
  1156	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tGrete.
  1157	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1158	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tGregor kept trying to assure himself that nothing unusual was
  1159	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thappening, it was just a few pieces of furniture being moved after
  1160	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tall, but he soon had to admit that the women going to and fro, their
  1161	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tlittle calls to each other, the scraping of the furniture on the
  1162	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfloor, all these things made him feel as if he were being assailed
  1163	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfrom all sides.  With his head and legs pulled in against him and
  1164	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\this body pressed to the floor, he was forced to admit to himself
  1165	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthat he could not stand all of this much longer.  They were emptying
  1166	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\this room out; taking away everything that was dear to him; they had
  1167	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\talready taken out the chest containing his fretsaw and other tools;
  1168	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tnow they threatened to remove the writing desk with its place
  1169	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tclearly worn into the floor, the desk where he had done his homework
  1170	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tas a business trainee, at high school, even while he had been at
  1171	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tinfant school--he really could not wait any longer to see whether
  1172	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe two women's intentions were good.  He had nearly forgotten they
  1173	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twere there anyway, as they were now too tired to say anything while
  1174	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthey worked and he could only hear their feet as they stepped
  1175	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\theavily on the floor.
  1176	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1177	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tSo, while the women were leant against the desk in the other room
  1178	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcatching their breath, he sallied out, changed direction four times
  1179	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tnot knowing what he should save first before his attention was
  1180	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsuddenly caught by the picture on the wall - which was already
  1181	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdenuded of everything else that had been on it - of the lady dressed
  1182	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tin copious fur.  He hurried up onto the picture and pressed himself
  1183	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tagainst its glass, it held him firmly and felt good on his hot
  1184	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbelly.  This picture at least, now totally covered by Gregor, would
  1185	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcertainly be taken away by no-one.  He turned his head to face the
  1186	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdoor into the living room so that he could watch the women when they
  1187	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcame back.
  1188	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1189	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tThey had not allowed themselves a long rest and came back quite
  1190	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsoon; Grete had put her arm around her mother and was nearly
  1191	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcarrying her.  "What shall we take now, then?", said Grete and
  1192	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tlooked around.  Her eyes met those of Gregor on the wall.  Perhaps
  1193	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tonly because her mother was there, she remained calm, bent her face
  1194	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tto her so that she would not look round and said, albeit hurriedly
  1195	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tand with a tremor in her voice: "Come on, let's go back in the
  1196	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tliving room for a while?"  Gregor could see what Grete had in mind,
  1197	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tshe wanted to take her mother somewhere safe and then chase him down
  1198	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfrom the wall.  Well, she could certainly try it! He sat unyielding
  1199	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ton his picture.  He would rather jump at Grete's face.
  1200	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1201	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tBut Grete's words had made her mother quite worried, she stepped to
  1202	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tone side, saw the enormous brown patch against the flowers of the
  1203	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twallpaper, and before she even realised it was Gregor that she saw
  1204	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tscreamed: "Oh God, oh God!"  Arms outstretched, she fell onto the
  1205	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcouch as if she had given up everything and stayed there immobile.
  1206	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t"Gregor!" shouted his sister, glowering at him and shaking her fist.
  1207	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t That was the first word she had spoken to him directly since his
  1208	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ttransformation.  She ran into the other room to fetch some kind of
  1209	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsmelling salts to bring her mother out of her faint; Gregor wanted
  1210	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tto help too - he could save his picture later, although he stuck
  1211	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfast to the glass and had to pull himself off by force; then he,
  1212	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ttoo, ran into the next room as if he could advise his sister like in
  1213	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe old days; but he had to just stand behind her doing nothing; she
  1214	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twas looking into various bottles, he startled her when she turned
  1215	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tround; a bottle fell to the ground and broke; a splinter cut
  1216	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tGregor's face, some kind of caustic medicine splashed all over him;
  1217	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tnow, without delaying any longer, Grete took hold of all the bottles
  1218	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tshe could and ran with them in to her mother; she slammed the door
  1219	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tshut with her foot.  So now Gregor was shut out from his mother,
  1220	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twho, because of him, might be near to death; he could not open the
  1221	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdoor if he did not want to chase his sister away, and she had to
  1222	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tstay with his mother; there was nothing for him to do but wait; and,
  1223	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\toppressed with anxiety and self-reproach, he began to crawl about,
  1224	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\the crawled over everything, walls, furniture, ceiling, and finally
  1225	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tin his confusion as the whole room began to spin around him he fell
  1226	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdown into the middle of the dinner table.
  1227	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1228	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tHe lay there for a while, numb and immobile, all around him it was
  1229	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tquiet, maybe that was a good sign.  Then there was someone at the
  1230	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdoor.  The maid, of course, had locked herself in her kitchen so
  1231	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthat Grete would have to go and answer it.  His father had arrived
  1232	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thome.  "What's happened?" were his first words; Grete's appearance
  1233	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tmust have made everything clear to him.  She answered him with
  1234	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsubdued voice, and openly pressed her face into his chest: "Mother's
  1235	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfainted, but she's better now.  Gregor got out."  "Just as I
  1236	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\texpected", said his father, "just as I always said, but you women
  1237	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twouldn't listen, would you."  It was clear to Gregor that Grete had
  1238	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tnot said enough and that his father took it to mean that something
  1239	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbad had happened, that he was responsible for some act of violence.
  1240	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tThat meant Gregor would now have to try to calm his father, as he
  1241	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdid not have the time to explain things to him even if that had been
  1242	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tpossible.  So he fled to the door of his room and pressed himself
  1243	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tagainst it so that his father, when he came in from the hall, could
  1244	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsee straight away that Gregor had the best intentions and would go
  1245	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tback into his room without delay, that it would not be necessary to
  1246	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdrive him back but that they had only to open the door and he would
  1247	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdisappear.
  1248	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1249	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tHis father, though, was not in the mood to notice subtleties like
  1250	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthat; "Ah!", he shouted as he came in, sounding as if he were both
  1251	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tangry and glad at the same time.  Gregor drew his head back from the
  1252	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdoor and lifted it towards his father.  He really had not imagined
  1253	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\this father the way he stood there now; of late, with his new habit
  1254	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tof crawling about, he had neglected to pay attention to what was
  1255	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tgoing on the rest of the flat the way he had done before.  He really
  1256	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tought to have expected things to have changed, but still, still, was
  1257	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthat really his father? The same tired man as used to be laying
  1258	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthere entombed in his bed when Gregor came back from his business
  1259	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ttrips, who would receive him sitting in the armchair in his
  1260	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tnightgown when he came back in the evenings; who was hardly even
  1261	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\table to stand up but, as a sign of his pleasure, would just raise
  1262	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\this arms and who, on the couple of times a year when they went for a
  1263	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twalk together on a Sunday or public holiday wrapped up tightly in
  1264	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\this overcoat between Gregor and his mother, would always labour his
  1265	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tway forward a little more slowly than them, who were already walking
  1266	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tslowly for his sake; who would place his stick down carefully and,
  1267	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tif he wanted to say something would invariably stop and gather his
  1268	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcompanions around him.  He was standing up straight enough now;
  1269	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdressed in a smart blue uniform with gold buttons, the sort worn by
  1270	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe employees at the banking institute; above the high, stiff collar
  1271	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tof the coat his strong double-chin emerged; under the bushy
  1272	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\teyebrows, his piercing, dark eyes looked out fresh and alert; his
  1273	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tnormally unkempt white hair was combed down painfully close to his
  1274	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tscalp.  He took his cap, with its gold monogram from, probably, some
  1275	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbank, and threw it in an arc right across the room onto the sofa,
  1276	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tput his hands in his trouser pockets, pushing back the bottom of his
  1277	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tlong uniform coat, and, with look of determination, walked towards
  1278	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tGregor.  He probably did not even know himself what he had in mind,
  1279	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbut nonetheless lifted his feet unusually high.  Gregor was amazed
  1280	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tat the enormous size of the soles of his boots, but wasted no time
  1281	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twith that - he knew full well, right from the first day of his new
  1282	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tlife, that his father thought it necessary to always be extremely
  1283	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tstrict with him.  And so he ran up to his father, stopped when his
  1284	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfather stopped, scurried forwards again when he moved, even
  1285	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tslightly.  In this way they went round the room several times
  1286	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twithout anything decisive happening, without even giving the
  1287	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\timpression of a chase as everything went so slowly.  Gregor remained
  1288	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tall this time on the floor, largely because he feared his father
  1289	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tmight see it as especially provoking if he fled onto the wall or
  1290	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tceiling.  Whatever he did, Gregor had to admit that he certainly
  1291	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twould not be able to keep up this running about for long, as for
  1292	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\teach step his father took he had to carry out countless movements.
  1293	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tHe became noticeably short of breath, even in his earlier life his
  1294	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tlungs had not been very reliable.  Now, as he lurched about in his
  1295	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tefforts to muster all the strength he could for running he could
  1296	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thardly keep his eyes open; his thoughts became too slow for him to
  1297	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthink of any other way of saving himself than running; he almost
  1298	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tforgot that the walls were there for him to use although, here, they
  1299	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twere concealed behind carefully carved furniture full of notches and
  1300	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tprotrusions - then, right beside him, lightly tossed, something flew
  1301	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdown and rolled in front of him.  It was an apple; then another one
  1302	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\timmediately flew at him; Gregor froze in shock; there was no longer
  1303	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tany point in running as his father had decided to bombard him.  He
  1304	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thad filled his pockets with fruit from the bowl on the sideboard and
  1305	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tnow, without even taking the time for careful aim, threw one apple
  1306	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tafter another.  These little, red apples rolled about on the floor,
  1307	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tknocking into each other as if they had electric motors.  An apple
  1308	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthrown without much force glanced against Gregor's back and slid off
  1309	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twithout doing any harm.  Another one however, immediately following
  1310	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tit, hit squarely and lodged in his back; Gregor wanted to drag
  1311	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thimself away, as if he could remove the surprising, the incredible
  1312	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tpain by changing his position; but he felt as if nailed to the spot
  1313	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tand spread himself out, all his senses in confusion.  The last thing
  1314	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\the saw was the door of his room being pulled open, his sister was
  1315	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tscreaming, his mother ran out in front of her in her blouse (as his
  1316	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsister had taken off some of her clothes after she had fainted to
  1317	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tmake it easier for her to breathe), she ran to his father, her
  1318	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tskirts unfastened and sliding one after another to the ground,
  1319	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tstumbling over the skirts she pushed herself to his father, her arms
  1320	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\taround him, uniting herself with him totally - now Gregor lost his
  1321	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tability to see anything - her hands behind his father's head begging
  1322	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thim to spare Gregor's life.
  1323	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1324	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1325	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1326	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tIII
  1327	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1328	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1329	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tNo-one dared to remove the apple lodged in Gregor's flesh, so it
  1330	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tremained there as a visible reminder of his injury.  He had suffered
  1331	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tit there for more than a month, and his condition seemed serious
  1332	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tenough to remind even his father that Gregor, despite his current
  1333	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsad and revolting form, was a family member who could not be treated
  1334	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tas an enemy.  On the contrary, as a family there was a duty to
  1335	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tswallow any revulsion for him and to be patient, just to be patient.
  1336	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1337	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tBecause of his injuries, Gregor had lost much of his mobility -
  1338	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tprobably permanently.  He had been reduced to the condition of an
  1339	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tancient invalid and it took him long, long minutes to crawl across
  1340	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\this room - crawling over the ceiling was out of the question - but
  1341	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthis deterioration in his condition was fully (in his opinion) made
  1342	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tup for by the door to the living room being left open every evening.
  1343	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t He got into the habit of closely watching it for one or two hours
  1344	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbefore it was opened and then, lying in the darkness of his room
  1345	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twhere he could not be seen from the living room, he could watch the
  1346	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfamily in the light of the dinner table and listen to their
  1347	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tconversation - with everyone's permission, in a way, and thus quite
  1348	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdifferently from before.
  1349	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1350	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tThey no longer held the lively conversations of earlier times, of
  1351	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcourse, the ones that Gregor always thought about with longing when
  1352	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\the was tired and getting into the damp bed in some small hotel room.
  1353	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t All of them were usually very quiet nowadays.  Soon after dinner,
  1354	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\this father would go to sleep in his chair; his mother and sister
  1355	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twould urge each other to be quiet; his mother, bent deeply under the
  1356	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tlamp, would sew fancy underwear for a fashion shop; his sister, who
  1357	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thad taken a sales job, learned shorthand and French in the evenings
  1358	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tso that she might be able to get a better position later on.
  1359	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tSometimes his father would wake up and say to Gregor's mother
  1360	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t"you're doing so much sewing again today!", as if he did not know
  1361	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthat he had been dozing - and then he would go back to sleep again
  1362	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twhile mother and sister would exchange a tired grin.
  1363	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1364	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tWith a kind of stubbornness, Gregor's father refused to take his
  1365	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tuniform off even at home; while his nightgown hung unused on its peg
  1366	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tGregor's father would slumber where he was, fully dressed, as if
  1367	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\talways ready to serve and expecting to hear the voice of his
  1368	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsuperior even here.  The uniform had not been new to start with, but
  1369	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tas a result of this it slowly became even shabbier despite the
  1370	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tefforts of Gregor's mother and sister to look after it.  Gregor
  1371	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twould often spend the whole evening looking at all the stains on
  1372	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthis coat, with its gold buttons always kept polished and shiny,
  1373	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twhile the old man in it would sleep, highly uncomfortable but
  1374	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tpeaceful.
  1375	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1376	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tAs soon as it struck ten, Gregor's mother would speak gently to his
  1377	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfather to wake him and try to persuade him to go to bed, as he
  1378	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcouldn't sleep properly where he was and he really had to get his
  1379	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsleep if he was to be up at six to get to work.  But since he had
  1380	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbeen in work he had become more obstinate and would always insist on
  1381	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tstaying longer at the table, even though he regularly fell asleep
  1382	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tand it was then harder than ever to persuade him to exchange the
  1383	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tchair for his bed.  Then, however much mother and sister would
  1384	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\timportune him with little reproaches and warnings he would keep
  1385	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tslowly shaking his head for a quarter of an hour with his eyes
  1386	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tclosed and refusing to get up.  Gregor's mother would tug at his
  1387	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsleeve, whisper endearments into his ear, Gregor's sister would
  1388	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tleave her work to help her mother, but nothing would have any effect
  1389	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ton him.  He would just sink deeper into his chair.  Only when the
  1390	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ttwo women took him under the arms he would abruptly open his eyes,
  1391	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tlook at them one after the other and say: "What a life! This is what
  1392	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tpeace I get in my old age!"  And supported by the two women he would
  1393	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tlift himself up carefully as if he were carrying the greatest load
  1394	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thimself, let the women take him to the door, send them off and carry
  1395	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ton by himself while Gregor's mother would throw down her needle and
  1396	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\this sister her pen so that they could run after his father and
  1397	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcontinue being of help to him.
  1398	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1399	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tWho, in this tired and overworked family, would have had time to
  1400	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tgive more attention to Gregor than was absolutely necessary? The
  1401	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thousehold budget became even smaller; so now the maid was dismissed;
  1402	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tan enormous, thick-boned charwoman with white hair that flapped
  1403	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\taround her head came every morning and evening to do the heaviest
  1404	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twork; everything else was looked after by Gregor's mother on top of
  1405	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe large amount of sewing work she did.  Gregor even learned,
  1406	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tlistening to the evening conversation about what price they had
  1407	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thoped for, that several items of jewellery belonging to the family
  1408	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thad been sold, even though both mother and sister had been very fond
  1409	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tof wearing them at functions and celebrations.  But the loudest
  1410	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcomplaint was that although the flat was much too big for their
  1411	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tpresent circumstances, they could not move out of it, there was no
  1412	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\timaginable way of transferring Gregor to the new address.  He could
  1413	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsee quite well, though, that there were more reasons than
  1414	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tconsideration for him that made it difficult for them to move, it
  1415	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twould have been quite easy to transport him in any suitable crate
  1416	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twith a few air holes in it; the main thing holding the family back
  1417	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfrom their decision to move was much more to do with their total
  1418	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdespair, and the thought that they had been struck with a misfortune
  1419	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tunlike anything experienced by anyone else they knew or were related
  1420	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tto.  They carried out absolutely everything that the world expects
  1421	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfrom poor people, Gregor's father brought bank employees their
  1422	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbreakfast, his mother sacrificed herself by washing clothes for
  1423	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tstrangers, his sister ran back and forth behind her desk at the
  1424	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbehest of the customers, but they just did not have the strength to
  1425	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdo any more.  And the injury in Gregor's back began to hurt as much
  1426	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tas when it was new.  After they had come back from taking his father
  1427	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tto bed Gregor's mother and sister would now leave their work where
  1428	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tit was and sit close together, cheek to cheek; his mother would
  1429	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tpoint to Gregor's room and say "Close that door, Grete", and then,
  1430	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twhen he was in the dark again, they would sit in the next room and
  1431	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ttheir tears would mingle, or they would simply sit there staring
  1432	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdry-eyed at the table.
  1433	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1434	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tGregor hardly slept at all, either night or day.  Sometimes he would
  1435	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthink of taking over the family's affairs, just like before, the
  1436	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tnext time the door was opened; he had long forgotten about his boss
  1437	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tand the chief clerk, but they would appear again in his thoughts,
  1438	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe salesmen and the apprentices, that stupid teaboy, two or three
  1439	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfriends from other businesses, one of the chambermaids from a
  1440	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tprovincial hotel, a tender memory that appeared and disappeared
  1441	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tagain, a cashier from a hat shop for whom his attention had been
  1442	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tserious but too slow, - all of them appeared to him, mixed together
  1443	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twith strangers and others he had forgotten, but instead of helping
  1444	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thim and his family they were all of them inaccessible, and he was
  1445	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tglad when they disappeared.  Other times he was not at all in the
  1446	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tmood to look after his family, he was filled with simple rage about
  1447	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe lack of attention he was shown, and although he could think of
  1448	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tnothing he would have wanted, he made plans of how he could get into
  1449	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe pantry where he could take all the things he was entitled to,
  1450	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\teven if he was not hungry.  Gregor's sister no longer thought about
  1451	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thow she could please him but would hurriedly push some food or other
  1452	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tinto his room with her foot before she rushed out to work in the
  1453	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tmorning and at midday, and in the evening she would sweep it away
  1454	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tagain with the broom, indifferent as to whether it had been eaten or
  1455	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t- more often than not - had been left totally untouched.  She still
  1456	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcleared up the room in the evening, but now she could not have been
  1457	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tany quicker about it.  Smears of dirt were left on the walls, here
  1458	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tand there were little balls of dust and filth.  At first, Gregor
  1459	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twent into one of the worst of these places when his sister arrived
  1460	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tas a reproach to her, but he could have stayed there for weeks
  1461	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twithout his sister doing anything about it; she could see the dirt
  1462	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tas well as he could but she had simply decided to leave him to it.
  1463	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tAt the same time she became touchy in a way that was quite new for
  1464	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ther and which everyone in the family understood - cleaning up
  1465	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tGregor's room was for her and her alone.  Gregor's mother did once
  1466	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthoroughly clean his room, and needed to use several bucketfuls of
  1467	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twater to do it - although that much dampness also made Gregor ill
  1468	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tand he lay flat on the couch, bitter and immobile.  But his mother
  1469	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twas to be punished still more for what she had done, as hardly had
  1470	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\this sister arrived home in the evening than she noticed the change
  1471	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tin Gregor's room and, highly aggrieved, ran back into the living
  1472	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\troom where, despite her mothers raised and imploring hands, she
  1473	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbroke into convulsive tears.  Her father, of course, was startled
  1474	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tout of his chair and the two parents looked on astonished and
  1475	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thelpless; then they, too, became agitated; Gregor's father, standing
  1476	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tto the right of his mother, accused her of not leaving the cleaning
  1477	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tof Gregor's room to his sister; from her left, Gregor's sister
  1478	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tscreamed at her that she was never to clean Gregor's room again;
  1479	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twhile his mother tried to draw his father, who was beside himself
  1480	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twith anger, into the bedroom; his sister, quaking with tears,
  1481	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthumped on the table with her small fists; and Gregor hissed in
  1482	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tanger that no-one had even thought of closing the door to save him
  1483	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe sight of this and all its noise.
  1484	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1485	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tGregor's sister was exhausted from going out to work, and looking
  1486	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tafter Gregor as she had done before was even more work for her, but
  1487	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\teven so his mother ought certainly not to have taken her place.
  1488	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tGregor, on the other hand, ought not to be neglected.  Now, though,
  1489	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe charwoman was here.  This elderly widow, with a robust bone
  1490	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tstructure that made her able to withstand the hardest of things in
  1491	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ther long life, wasn't really repelled by Gregor.  Just by chance one
  1492	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tday, rather than any real curiosity, she opened the door to Gregor's
  1493	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\troom and found herself face to face with him.  He was taken totally
  1494	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tby surprise, no-one was chasing him but he began to rush to and fro
  1495	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twhile she just stood there in amazement with her hands crossed in
  1496	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfront of her.  From then on she never failed to open the door
  1497	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tslightly every evening and morning and look briefly in on him.  At
  1498	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfirst she would call to him as she did so with words that she
  1499	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tprobably considered friendly, such as "come on then, you old
  1500	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdung-beetle!", or "look at the old dung-beetle there!"  Gregor never
  1501	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tresponded to being spoken to in that way, but just remained where he
  1502	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twas without moving as if the door had never even been opened.  If
  1503	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tonly they had told this charwoman to clean up his room every day
  1504	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tinstead of letting her disturb him for no reason whenever she felt
  1505	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tlike it! One day, early in the morning while a heavy rain struck the
  1506	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twindowpanes, perhaps indicating that spring was coming, she began to
  1507	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tspeak to him in that way once again.  Gregor was so resentful of it
  1508	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthat he started to move toward her, he was slow and infirm, but it
  1509	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twas like a kind of attack.  Instead of being afraid, the charwoman
  1510	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tjust lifted up one of the chairs from near the door and stood there
  1511	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twith her mouth open, clearly intending not to close her mouth until
  1512	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe chair in her hand had been slammed down into Gregor's back.
  1513	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t"Aren't you coming any closer, then?", she asked when Gregor turned
  1514	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tround again, and she calmly put the chair back in the corner.
  1515	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1516	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tGregor had almost entirely stopped eating.  Only if he happened to
  1517	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfind himself next to the food that had been prepared for him he
  1518	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tmight take some of it into his mouth to play with it, leave it there
  1519	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ta few hours and then, more often than not, spit it out again.  At
  1520	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfirst he thought it was distress at the state of his room that
  1521	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tstopped him eating, but he had soon got used to the changes made
  1522	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthere.  They had got into the habit of putting things into this room
  1523	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthat they had no room for anywhere else, and there were now many
  1524	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsuch things as one of the rooms in the flat had been rented out to
  1525	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthree gentlemen.  These earnest gentlemen - all three of them had
  1526	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfull beards, as Gregor learned peering through the crack in the door
  1527	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tone day - were painfully insistent on things' being tidy.  This
  1528	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tmeant not only in their own room but, since they had taken a room in
  1529	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthis establishment, in the entire flat and especially in the
  1530	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tkitchen.  Unnecessary clutter was something they could not tolerate,
  1531	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tespecially if it was dirty.  They had moreover brought most of their
  1532	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\town furnishings and equipment with them.  For this reason, many
  1533	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthings had become superfluous which, although they could not be
  1534	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsold, the family did not wish to discard.  All these things found
  1535	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ttheir way into Gregor's room.  The dustbins from the kitchen found
  1536	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ttheir way in there too.  The charwoman was always in a hurry, and
  1537	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tanything she couldn't use for the time being she would just chuck in
  1538	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthere.  He, fortunately, would usually see no more than the object
  1539	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tand the hand that held it.  The woman most likely meant to fetch the
  1540	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthings back out again when she had time and the opportunity, or to
  1541	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthrow everything out in one go, but what actually happened was that
  1542	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthey were left where they landed when they had first been thrown
  1543	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tunless Gregor made his way through the junk and moved it somewhere
  1544	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\telse.  At first he moved it because, with no other room free where
  1545	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\the could crawl about, he was forced to, but later on he came to
  1546	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tenjoy it although moving about in that way left him sad and tired to
  1547	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdeath and he would remain immobile for hours afterwards.
  1548	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1549	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tThe gentlemen who rented the room would sometimes take their evening
  1550	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tmeal at home in the living room that was used by everyone, and so
  1551	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe door to this room was often kept closed in the evening.  But
  1552	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tGregor found it easy to give up having the door open, he had, after
  1553	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tall, often failed to make use of it when it was open and, without
  1554	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe family having noticed it, lain in his room in its darkest
  1555	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcorner.  One time, though, the charwoman left the door to the living
  1556	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\troom slightly open, and it remained open when the gentlemen who
  1557	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\trented the room came in in the evening and the light was put on.
  1558	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tThey sat up at the table where, formerly, Gregor had taken his meals
  1559	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twith his father and mother, they unfolded the serviettes and picked
  1560	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tup their knives and forks.  Gregor's mother immediately appeared in
  1561	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe doorway with a dish of meat and soon behind her came his sister
  1562	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twith a dish piled high with potatoes.  The food was steaming, and
  1563	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfilled the room with its smell.  The gentlemen bent over the dishes
  1564	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tset in front of them as if they wanted to test the food before
  1565	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\teating it, and the gentleman in the middle, who seemed to count as
  1566	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tan authority for the other two, did indeed cut off a piece of meat
  1567	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twhile it was still in its dish, clearly wishing to establish whether
  1568	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tit was sufficiently cooked or whether it should be sent back to the
  1569	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tkitchen.  It was to his satisfaction, and Gregor's mother and
  1570	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsister, who had been looking on anxiously, began to breathe again
  1571	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tand smiled.
  1572	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1573	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tThe family themselves ate in the kitchen.  Nonetheless, Gregor's
  1574	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfather came into the living room before he went into the kitchen,
  1575	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbowed once with his cap in his hand and did his round of the table.
  1576	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tThe gentlemen stood as one, and mumbled something into their beards.
  1577	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t Then, once they were alone, they ate in near perfect silence.  It
  1578	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tseemed remarkable to Gregor that above all the various noises of
  1579	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\teating their chewing teeth could still be heard, as if they had
  1580	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twanted to show Gregor that you need teeth in order to eat and it was
  1581	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tnot possible to perform anything with jaws that are toothless
  1582	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thowever nice they might be.  "I'd like to eat something", said
  1583	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tGregor anxiously, "but not anything like they're eating.  They do
  1584	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfeed themselves.  And here I am, dying!"
  1585	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1586	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tThroughout all this time, Gregor could not remember having heard the
  1587	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tviolin being played, but this evening it began to be heard from the
  1588	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tkitchen.  The three gentlemen had already finished their meal, the
  1589	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tone in the middle had produced a newspaper, given a page to each of
  1590	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe others, and now they leant back in their chairs reading them and
  1591	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsmoking.  When the violin began playing they became attentive, stood
  1592	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tup and went on tip-toe over to the door of the hallway where they
  1593	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tstood pressed against each other.  Someone must have heard them in
  1594	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe kitchen, as Gregor's father called out: "Is the playing perhaps
  1595	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tunpleasant for the gentlemen? We can stop it straight away."  "On
  1596	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe contrary", said the middle gentleman, "would the young lady not
  1597	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tlike to come in and play for us here in the room, where it is, after
  1598	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tall, much more cosy and comfortable?"  "Oh yes, we'd love to",
  1599	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcalled back Gregor's father as if he had been the violin player
  1600	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thimself.  The gentlemen stepped back into the room and waited.
  1601	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tGregor's father soon appeared with the music stand, his mother with
  1602	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe music and his sister with the violin.  She calmly prepared
  1603	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\teverything for her to begin playing; his parents, who had never
  1604	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\trented a room out before and therefore showed an exaggerated
  1605	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcourtesy towards the three gentlemen, did not even dare to sit on
  1606	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ttheir own chairs; his father leant against the door with his right
  1607	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thand pushed in between two buttons on his uniform coat; his mother,
  1608	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthough, was offered a seat by one of the gentlemen and sat - leaving
  1609	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe chair where the gentleman happened to have placed it - out of
  1610	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe way in a corner.
  1611	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1612	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tHis sister began to play; father and mother paid close attention,
  1613	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tone on each side, to the movements of her hands.  Drawn in by the
  1614	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tplaying, Gregor had dared to come forward a little and already had
  1615	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\this head in the living room.  Before, he had taken great pride in
  1616	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thow considerate he was but now it hardly occurred to him that he had
  1617	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbecome so thoughtless about the others.  What's more, there was now
  1618	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tall the more reason to keep himself hidden as he was covered in the
  1619	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdust that lay everywhere in his room and flew up at the slightest
  1620	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tmovement; he carried threads, hairs, and remains of food about on
  1621	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\this back and sides; he was much too indifferent to everything now to
  1622	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tlay on his back and wipe himself on the carpet like he had used to
  1623	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdo several times a day.  And despite this condition, he was not too
  1624	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tshy to move forward a little onto the immaculate floor of the living
  1625	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\troom.
  1626	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1627	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tNo-one noticed him, though.  The family was totally preoccupied with
  1628	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe violin playing; at first, the three gentlemen had put their
  1629	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thands in their pockets and come up far too close behind the music
  1630	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tstand to look at all the notes being played, and they must have
  1631	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdisturbed Gregor's sister, but soon, in contrast with the family,
  1632	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthey  withdrew back to the window with their heads sunk and talking
  1633	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tto each other at half volume, and they stayed by the window while
  1634	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tGregor's father observed them anxiously.  It really now seemed very
  1635	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tobvious that they had expected to hear some beautiful or
  1636	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tentertaining violin playing but had been disappointed, that they had
  1637	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thad enough of the whole performance and it was only now out of
  1638	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tpoliteness that they allowed their peace to be disturbed.  It was
  1639	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tespecially unnerving, the way they all blew the smoke from their
  1640	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcigarettes upwards from their mouth and noses.  Yet Gregor's sister
  1641	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twas playing so beautifully.  Her face was leant to one side,
  1642	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfollowing the lines of music with a careful and melancholy
  1643	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\texpression.  Gregor crawled a little further forward, keeping his
  1644	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thead close to the ground so that he could meet her eyes if the
  1645	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tchance came.  Was he an animal if music could captivate him so? It
  1646	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tseemed to him that he was being shown the way to the unknown
  1647	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tnourishment he had been yearning for.  He was determined to make his
  1648	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tway forward to his sister and tug at her skirt to show her she might
  1649	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcome into his room with her violin, as no-one appreciated her
  1650	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tplaying here as much as he would.  He never wanted to let her out of
  1651	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\this room, not while he lived, anyway; his shocking appearance
  1652	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tshould, for once, be of some use to him; he wanted to be at every
  1653	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdoor of his room at once to hiss and spit at the attackers; his
  1654	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsister should not be forced to stay with him, though, but stay of
  1655	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ther own free will; she would sit beside him on the couch with her
  1656	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tear bent down to him while he told her how he had always intended to
  1657	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsend her to the conservatory, how he would have told everyone about
  1658	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tit last Christmas - had Christmas really come and gone already? - if
  1659	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthis misfortune hadn't got in the way, and refuse to let anyone
  1660	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdissuade him from it.  On hearing all this, his sister would break
  1661	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tout in tears of emotion, and Gregor would climb up to her shoulder
  1662	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tand kiss her neck, which, since she had been going out to work, she
  1663	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thad kept free without any necklace or collar.
  1664	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1665	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t"Mr. Samsa!", shouted the middle gentleman to Gregor's father,
  1666	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tpointing, without wasting any more words, with his forefinger at
  1667	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tGregor as he slowly moved forward.  The violin went silent, the
  1668	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tmiddle of the three gentlemen first smiled at his two friends,
  1669	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tshaking his head, and then looked back at Gregor.  His father seemed
  1670	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tto think it more important to calm the three gentlemen before
  1671	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdriving Gregor out, even though they were not at all upset and
  1672	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tseemed to think Gregor was more entertaining than the violin playing
  1673	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thad been.  He rushed up to them with his arms spread out and
  1674	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tattempted to drive them back into their room at the same time as
  1675	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ttrying to block their view of Gregor with his body.  Now they did
  1676	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbecome a little annoyed, and it was not clear whether it was his
  1677	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfather's behaviour that annoyed them or the dawning realisation that
  1678	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthey had had a neighbour like Gregor in the next room without
  1679	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tknowing it.  They asked Gregor's father for explanations, raised
  1680	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ttheir arms like he had, tugged excitedly at their beards and moved
  1681	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tback towards their room only very slowly.  Meanwhile Gregor's sister
  1682	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thad overcome the despair she had fallen into when her playing was
  1683	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsuddenly interrupted.  She had let her hands drop and let violin and
  1684	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbow hang limply for a while but continued to look at the music as if
  1685	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tstill playing, but then she suddenly pulled herself together, lay
  1686	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe instrument on her mother's lap who still sat laboriously
  1687	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tstruggling for breath where she was, and ran into the next room
  1688	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twhich, under pressure from her father, the three gentlemen were more
  1689	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tquickly moving toward.  Under his sister's experienced hand, the
  1690	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tpillows and covers on the beds flew up and were put into order and
  1691	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tshe had already finished making the beds and slipped out again
  1692	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbefore the three gentlemen had reached the room.  Gregor's father
  1693	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tseemed so obsessed with what he was doing that he forgot all the
  1694	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\trespect he owed to his tenants.  He urged them and pressed them
  1695	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tuntil, when he was already at the door of the room, the middle of
  1696	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe three gentlemen shouted like thunder and stamped his foot and
  1697	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthereby brought Gregor's father to a halt.  "I declare here and
  1698	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tnow", he said, raising his hand and glancing at Gregor's mother and
  1699	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsister to gain their attention too, "that with regard to the
  1700	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\trepugnant conditions that prevail in this flat and with this family"
  1701	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t- here he looked briefly but decisively at the floor - "I give
  1702	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\timmediate notice on my room.  For the days that I have been living
  1703	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\there I will, of course, pay nothing at all, on the contrary I will
  1704	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tconsider whether to proceed with some kind of action for damages
  1705	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfrom you, and believe me it would be very easy to set out the
  1706	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tgrounds for such an action."  He was silent and looked straight
  1707	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tahead as if waiting for something.  And indeed, his two friends
  1708	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tjoined in with the words: "And we also give immediate notice."  With
  1709	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthat, he took hold of the door handle and slammed the door.
  1710	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1711	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tGregor's father staggered back to his seat, feeling his way with his
  1712	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thands, and fell into it; it looked as if he was stretching himself
  1713	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tout for his usual evening nap but from the uncontrolled way his head
  1714	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tkept nodding it could be seen that he was not sleeping at all.
  1715	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tThroughout all this, Gregor had lain still where the three gentlemen
  1716	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thad first seen him.  His disappointment at the failure of his plan,
  1717	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tand perhaps also because he was weak from hunger, made it impossible
  1718	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfor him to move.  He was sure that everyone would turn on him any
  1719	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tmoment, and he waited.  He was not even startled out of this state
  1720	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twhen the violin on his mother's lap fell from her trembling fingers
  1721	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tand landed loudly on the floor.
  1722	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1723	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t"Father, Mother", said his sister, hitting the table with her hand
  1724	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tas introduction, "we can't carry on like this.  Maybe you can't see
  1725	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tit, but I can.  I don't want to call this monster my brother, all I
  1726	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcan say is: we have to try and get rid of it.  We've done all that's
  1727	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thumanly possible to look after it and be patient, I don't think
  1728	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tanyone could accuse us of doing anything wrong."
  1729	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1730	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t"She's absolutely right", said Gregor's father to himself.  His
  1731	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tmother, who still had not had time to catch her breath, began to
  1732	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcough dully, her hand held out in front of her and a deranged
  1733	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\texpression in her eyes.
  1734	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1735	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tGregor's sister rushed to his mother and put her hand on her
  1736	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tforehead.  Her words seemed to give Gregor's father some more
  1737	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdefinite ideas.  He sat upright, played with his uniform cap between
  1738	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe plates left by the three gentlemen after their meal, and
  1739	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\toccasionally looked down at Gregor as he lay there immobile.
  1740	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1741	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t"We have to try and get rid of it", said Gregor's sister, now
  1742	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tspeaking only to her father, as her mother was too occupied with
  1743	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcoughing to listen, "it'll be the death of both of you, I can see it
  1744	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcoming.  We can't all work as hard as we have to and then come home
  1745	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tto be tortured like this, we can't endure it.  I can't endure it any
  1746	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tmore."  And she broke out so heavily in tears that they flowed down
  1747	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe face of her mother, and she wiped them away with mechanical hand
  1748	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tmovements.
  1749	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1750	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t"My child", said her father with sympathy and obvious understanding,
  1751	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t"what are we to do?"
  1752	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1753	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tHis sister just shrugged her shoulders as a sign of the helplessness
  1754	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tand tears that had taken hold of her, displacing her earlier
  1755	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcertainty.
  1756	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1757	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t"If he could just understand us", said his father almost as a
  1758	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tquestion; his sister shook her hand vigorously through her tears as
  1759	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ta sign that of that there was no question.
  1760	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1761	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t"If he could just understand us", repeated Gregor's father, closing
  1762	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\this eyes in acceptance of his sister's certainty that that was quite
  1763	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\timpossible, "then perhaps we could come to some kind of arrangement
  1764	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twith him.  But as it is ..."
  1765	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1766	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t"It's got to go", shouted his sister, "that's the only way, Father.
  1767	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tYou've got to get rid of the idea that that's Gregor.  We've only
  1768	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tharmed ourselves by believing it for so long.  How can that be
  1769	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tGregor? If it were Gregor he would have seen long ago that it's not
  1770	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tpossible for human beings to live with an animal like that and he
  1771	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twould have gone of his own free will.  We wouldn't have a brother
  1772	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tany more, then, but we could carry on with our lives and remember
  1773	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thim with respect.  As it is this animal is persecuting us, it's
  1774	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdriven out our tenants, it obviously wants to take over the whole
  1775	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tflat and force us to sleep on the streets.  Father, look, just
  1776	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tlook", she suddenly screamed, "he's starting again!"   In her alarm,
  1777	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twhich was totally beyond Gregor's comprehension, his sister even
  1778	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tabandoned his mother as she pushed herself vigorously out of her
  1779	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tchair as if more willing to sacrifice her own mother than stay
  1780	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tanywhere near Gregor.  She rushed over to behind her father, who had
  1781	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbecome excited merely because she was and stood up half raising his
  1782	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thands in front of Gregor's sister as if to protect her.
  1783	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1784	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tBut Gregor had had no intention of frightening anyone, least of all
  1785	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\this sister.  All he had done was begin to turn round so that he
  1786	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcould go back into his room, although that was in itself quite
  1787	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tstartling as his pain-wracked condition meant that turning round
  1788	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\trequired a great deal of effort and he was using his head to help
  1789	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thimself do it, repeatedly raising it and striking it against the
  1790	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfloor.  He stopped and looked round.  They seemed to have realised
  1791	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\this good intention and had only been alarmed briefly.  Now they all
  1792	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tlooked at him in unhappy silence.  His mother lay in her chair with
  1793	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ther legs stretched out and pressed against each other, her eyes
  1794	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tnearly closed with exhaustion; his sister sat next to his father
  1795	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twith her arms around his neck.
  1796	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1797	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t"Maybe now they'll let me turn round", thought Gregor and went back
  1798	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tto work.  He could not help panting loudly with the effort and had
  1799	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsometimes to stop and take a rest.  No-one was making him rush any
  1800	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tmore, everything was left up to him.  As soon as he had finally
  1801	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfinished turning round he began to move straight ahead.  He was
  1802	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tamazed at the great distance that separated him from his room, and
  1803	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcould not understand how he had covered that distance in his weak
  1804	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tstate a little while before and almost without noticing it.  He
  1805	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tconcentrated on crawling as fast as he could and hardly noticed that
  1806	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthere was not a word, not any cry, from his family to distract him.
  1807	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tHe did not turn his head until he had reached the doorway.  He did
  1808	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tnot turn it all the way round as he felt his neck becoming stiff,
  1809	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbut it was nonetheless enough to see that nothing behind him had
  1810	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tchanged, only his sister had stood up.  With his last glance he saw
  1811	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthat his mother had now fallen completely asleep.
  1812	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1813	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tHe was hardly inside his room before the door was hurriedly shut,
  1814	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbolted and locked.  The sudden noise behind Gregor so startled him
  1815	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthat his little legs collapsed under him.  It was his sister who had
  1816	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbeen in so much of a rush.  She had been standing there waiting and
  1817	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsprung forward lightly, Gregor had not heard her coming at all, and
  1818	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tas she turned the key in the lock she said loudly to her parents "At
  1819	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tlast!".
  1820	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1821	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t"What now, then?", Gregor asked himself as he looked round in the
  1822	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdarkness.  He soon made the discovery that he could no longer move
  1823	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tat all.  This was no surprise to him, it seemed rather that being
  1824	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\table to actually move around on those spindly little legs until then
  1825	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twas unnatural.  He also felt relatively comfortable.  It is true
  1826	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthat his entire body was aching, but the pain seemed to be slowly
  1827	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tgetting weaker and weaker and would finally disappear altogether.
  1828	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tHe could already hardly feel the decayed apple in his back or the
  1829	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tinflamed area around it, which was entirely covered in white dust.
  1830	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tHe thought back of his family with emotion and love.  If it was
  1831	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tpossible, he felt that he must go away even more strongly than his
  1832	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsister.  He remained in this state of empty and peaceful rumination
  1833	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tuntil he heard the clock tower strike three in the morning.  He
  1834	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twatched as it slowly began to get light everywhere outside the
  1835	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twindow too.  Then, without his willing it, his head sank down
  1836	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcompletely, and his last breath flowed weakly from his nostrils.
  1837	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1838	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tWhen the cleaner came in early in the morning - they'd often asked
  1839	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ther not to keep slamming the doors but with her strength and in her
  1840	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thurry she still did, so that everyone in the flat knew when she'd
  1841	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tarrived and from then on it was impossible to sleep in peace - she
  1842	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tmade her usual brief look in on Gregor and at first found nothing
  1843	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tspecial.  She thought he was laying there so still on purpose,
  1844	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tplaying the martyr; she attributed all possible understanding to
  1845	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thim.  She happened to be holding the long broom in her hand, so she
  1846	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ttried to tickle Gregor with it from the doorway.  When she had no
  1847	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsuccess with that she tried to make a nuisance of herself and poked
  1848	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tat him a little, and only when she found she could shove him across
  1849	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe floor with no resistance at all did she start to pay attention.
  1850	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tShe soon realised what had really happened, opened her eyes wide,
  1851	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twhistled to herself, but did not waste time to yank open the bedroom
  1852	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdoors and shout loudly into the darkness of the bedrooms: "Come and
  1853	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t'ave a look at this, it's dead, just lying there, stone dead!"
  1854	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1855	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tMr. and  Mrs. Samsa sat upright there in their marriage bed and had
  1856	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tto make an effort to get over the shock caused by the cleaner before
  1857	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthey could grasp what she was saying.  But then, each from his own
  1858	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tside, they hurried out of bed.  Mr. Samsa threw the blanket over his
  1859	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tshoulders,  Mrs. Samsa just came out in her nightdress; and that is
  1860	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thow they went into Gregor's room.  On the way they opened the door
  1861	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tto the living room where Grete had been sleeping since the three
  1862	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tgentlemen had moved in; she was fully dressed as if she had never
  1863	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbeen asleep, and the paleness of her face seemed to confirm this.
  1864	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t"Dead?", asked  Mrs. Samsa, looking at the charwoman enquiringly,
  1865	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\teven though she could have checked for herself and could have known
  1866	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tit even without checking.  "That's what I said",  replied the
  1867	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcleaner, and to prove it she gave Gregor's body another shove with
  1868	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe broom, sending it sideways across the floor.  Mrs. Samsa made a
  1869	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tmovement as if she wanted to hold back the broom, but did not
  1870	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcomplete it.  "Now then", said  Mr. Samsa, "let's give thanks to God
  1871	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfor that". He crossed himself, and the three women followed his
  1872	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\texample.  Grete, who had not taken her eyes from the corpse, said:
  1873	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t"Just look how thin he was.  He didn't eat anything for so long.
  1874	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tThe food came out again just the same as when it went in". Gregor's
  1875	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbody was indeed completely dried up and flat, they had not seen it
  1876	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tuntil then, but now he was not lifted up on his little legs, nor did
  1877	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\the do anything to make them look away.
  1878	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1879	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t"Grete, come with us in here for a little while", said  Mrs. Samsa
  1880	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twith a pained smile, and Grete followed her parents into the bedroom
  1881	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbut not without looking back at the body.  The cleaner shut the door
  1882	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tand opened the window wide.  Although it was still early in the
  1883	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tmorning the fresh air had something of warmth mixed in with it.  It
  1884	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twas already the end of March, after all.
  1885	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1886	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tThe three gentlemen stepped out of their room and looked round in
  1887	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tamazement for their breakfasts;  they had been forgotten about.
  1888	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t"Where is our breakfast?", the middle gentleman asked the cleaner
  1889	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tirritably.  She just put her finger on her lips and made a quick and
  1890	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsilent sign to the men that they might like to come into Gregor's
  1891	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\troom.  They did so, and stood around Gregor's corpse with their
  1892	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thands in the pockets of their well-worn coats. It was now quite
  1893	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tlight in the room.
  1894	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1895	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tThen the door of the bedroom opened and  Mr. Samsa appeared in his
  1896	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tuniform with his wife on one arm and his daughter on the other.  All
  1897	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tof them had been crying a little; Grete now and then pressed her
  1898	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tface against her father's arm.
  1899	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1900	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t"Leave my home.  Now!", said  Mr. Samsa, indicating the door and
  1901	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twithout letting the women from him.  "What do you mean?", asked the
  1902	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tmiddle of the three gentlemen somewhat disconcerted, and he smiled
  1903	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsweetly.  The other two held their hands behind their backs and
  1904	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tcontinually rubbed them together in gleeful anticipation of a loud
  1905	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tquarrel which could only end in their favour.  "I mean just what I
  1906	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsaid", answered  Mr. Samsa, and, with his two companions, went in a
  1907	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tstraight line towards the man.  At first, he stood there still,
  1908	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tlooking at the ground as if the contents of his head were
  1909	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\trearranging themselves into new positions.  "Alright, we'll go
  1910	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthen", he said, and looked up at  Mr. Samsa as if he had been
  1911	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsuddenly overcome with humility and wanted permission again from
  1912	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tMr. Samsa for his decision.  Mr. Samsa merely opened his eyes wide
  1913	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tand briefly nodded to him several times.  At that, and without
  1914	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdelay, the man actually did take long strides into the front
  1915	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thallway; his two friends had stopped rubbing their hands some time
  1916	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbefore and had been listening to what was being said.  Now they
  1917	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tjumped off after their friend as if taken with a sudden fear that
  1918	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tMr. Samsa might go into the hallway in front of them and break the
  1919	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tconnection with their leader.  Once there, all three took their hats
  1920	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfrom the stand, took their sticks from the holder, bowed without a
  1921	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tword and left the premises.  Mr. Samsa and the two women followed
  1922	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthem out onto the landing; but they had had no reason to mistrust
  1923	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe men's intentions and as they leaned over the landing they saw how
  1924	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe three gentlemen made slow but steady progress down the many
  1925	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsteps.  As they turned the corner on each floor they disappeared and
  1926	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twould reappear a few moments later; the further down they went, the
  1927	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tmore that the Samsa family lost interest in them; when a butcher's
  1928	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tboy, proud of posture with his tray on his head, passed them on his
  1929	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tway up and came nearer than they were,  Mr. Samsa and the women came
  1930	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\taway from the landing and went, as if relieved, back into the flat.
  1931	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1932	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tThey decided the best way to make use of that day was for relaxation
  1933	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tand to go for a walk; not only had they earned a break from work but
  1934	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthey were in serious need of it.  So they sat at the table and wrote
  1935	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthree letters of excusal,  Mr. Samsa to his employers,  Mrs. Samsa
  1936	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tto her contractor and Grete to her principal.  The cleaner came in
  1937	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twhile they were writing to tell them she was going, she'd finished
  1938	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ther work for that morning.  The three of them at first just nodded
  1939	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twithout looking up from what they were writing, and it was only when
  1940	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe cleaner still did not seem to want to leave that they looked up
  1941	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tin irritation.  "Well?", asked  Mr. Samsa.  The charwoman stood in
  1942	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthe doorway with a smile on her face as if she had some tremendous
  1943	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tgood news to report, but would only do it if she was clearly asked
  1944	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tto.  The almost vertical little ostrich feather on her hat, which
  1945	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thad been a source of irritation to  Mr. Samsa all the time she had
  1946	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbeen working for them, swayed gently in all directions.  "What is it
  1947	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tyou want then?", asked  Mrs. Samsa, whom the cleaner had the most
  1948	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\trespect for.  "Yes", she answered, and broke into a friendly laugh
  1949	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthat made her unable to speak straight away, "well then, that thing
  1950	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tin there, you needn't worry about how you're going to get rid of it.
  1951	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t That's all been sorted out."   Mrs. Samsa and Grete bent down over
  1952	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ttheir letters as if intent on continuing with what they were
  1953	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twriting;  Mr. Samsa saw that the cleaner wanted to start describing
  1954	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\teverything in detail but, with outstretched hand, he made it quite
  1955	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tclear that she was not to.  So, as she was prevented from telling
  1956	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthem all about it, she suddenly remembered what a hurry she was in
  1957	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tand, clearly peeved, called out "Cheerio then, everyone", turned
  1958	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tround sharply and left, slamming the door terribly as she went.
  1959	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1960	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t"Tonight she gets sacked", said  Mr. Samsa, but he received no reply
  1961	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfrom either his wife or his daughter as the charwoman seemed to have
  1962	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tdestroyed the peace they had only just gained.  They got up and went
  1963	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tover to the window where they remained with their arms around each
  1964	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tother.  Mr. Samsa twisted round in his chair to look at them and sat
  1965	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthere watching for a while.  Then he called out: "Come here, then.
  1966	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tLet's forget about all that old stuff, shall we.  Come and give me a
  1967	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tbit of attention". The two women immediately did as he said,
  1968	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\thurrying over to him where they kissed him and hugged him and then
  1969	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthey quickly finished their letters.
  1970	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\t
  1971	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tAfter that, the three of them left the flat together, which was
  1972	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsomething they had not done for months, and took the tram out to the
  1973	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\topen country outside the town.  They had the tram, filled with warm
  1974	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsunshine, all to themselves.  Leant back comfortably on their seats,
  1975	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthey discussed their prospects and found that on closer examination
  1976	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tthey were not at all bad - until then they had never asked each
  1977	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tother about their work but all three had jobs which were very good
  1978	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tand held particularly good promise for the future.  The greatest
  1979	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\timprovement for the time being, of course, would be achieved quite
  1980	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\teasily by moving house; what they needed now was a flat that was
  1981	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsmaller and cheaper than the current one which had been chosen by
  1982	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tGregor, one that was in a better location and, most of all, more
  1983	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tpractical.  All the time, Grete was becoming livelier.  With all the
  1984	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tworry they had been having of late her cheeks had become pale, but,
  1985	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\twhile they were talking,  Mr. and  Mrs. Samsa were struck, almost
  1986	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tsimultaneously, with the thought of how their daughter was
  1987	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tblossoming into a well built and beautiful young lady.  They became
  1988	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tquieter.  Just from each other's glance and almost without knowing
  1989	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tit they agreed that it would soon be time to find a good man for
  1990	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\ther.  And, as if in confirmation of their new dreams and good
  1991	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tintentions, as soon as they reached their destination Grete was the
  1992	MetamorphisisByFranzKafka.txt\tfirst to get up and stretch out her young body.
