    39	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
    40	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
    41	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIt is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession
    42	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
    43	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
    44	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHowever little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
    45	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfirst entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds
    46	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property
    47	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof some one or other of their daughters.
    48	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
    49	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“My dear Mr. Bennet,” said his lady to him one day, “have you heard that
    50	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tNetherfield Park is let at last?”
    51	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
    52	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Bennet replied that he had not.
    53	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
    54	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“But it is,” returned she; “for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she
    55	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttold me all about it.”
    56	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
    57	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Bennet made no answer.
    58	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
    59	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Do you not want to know who has taken it?” cried his wife impatiently.
    60	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
    61	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.”
    62	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
    63	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThis was invitation enough.
    64	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
    65	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken
    66	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tby a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came
    67	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdown on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much
    68	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdelighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he
    69	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tis to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to
    70	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe in the house by the end of next week.”
    71	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
    72	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“What is his name?”
    73	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
    74	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Bingley.”
    75	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
    76	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Is he married or single?”
    77	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
    78	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or
    79	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfive thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!”
    80	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
    81	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“How so? How can it affect them?”
    82	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
    83	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“My dear Mr. Bennet,” replied his wife, “how can you be so tiresome! You
    84	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmust know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.”
    85	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
    86	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Is that his design in settling here?”
    87	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
    88	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he
    89	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as
    90	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsoon as he comes.”
    91	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
    92	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send
    93	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthem by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are
    94	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the
    95	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tparty.”
    96	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
    97	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but
    98	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five
    99	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgrown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.”
   100	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   101	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”
   102	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   103	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into
   104	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe neighbourhood.”
   105	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   106	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“It is more than I engage for, I assure you.”
   107	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   108	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would
   109	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to
   110	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgo, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no
   111	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnewcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to
   112	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvisit him if you do not.”
   113	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   114	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very
   115	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tglad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my
   116	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though
   117	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.”
   118	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   119	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the
   120	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tothers; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so
   121	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgood-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the preference.”
   122	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   123	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“They have none of them much to recommend them,” replied he; “they are
   124	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tall silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of
   125	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tquickness than her sisters.”
   126	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   127	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Mr. Bennet, how _can_ you abuse your own children in such a way? You
   128	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttake delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves.”
   129	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   130	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They
   131	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tare my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration
   132	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthese last twenty years at least.”
   133	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   134	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Ah, you do not know what I suffer.”
   135	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   136	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four
   137	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthousand a year come into the neighbourhood.”
   138	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   139	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not
   140	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvisit them.”
   141	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   142	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them
   143	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tall.”
   144	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   145	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,
   146	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had
   147	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeen insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind
   148	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding,
   149	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlittle information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented,
   150	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her
   151	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdaughters married; its solace was visiting and news.
   152	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   153	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   154	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   155	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tChapter 2
   156	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   157	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   158	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He
   159	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring
   160	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was
   161	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpaid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following
   162	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmanner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he
   163	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuddenly addressed her with:
   164	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   165	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.”
   166	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   167	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,” said her mother
   168	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tresentfully, “since we are not to visit.”
   169	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   170	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“But you forget, mamma,” said Elizabeth, “that we shall meet him at the
   171	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tassemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him.”
   172	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   173	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces
   174	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion
   175	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof her.”
   176	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   177	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“No more have I,” said Mr. Bennet; “and I am glad to find that you do
   178	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot depend on her serving you.”
   179	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   180	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain
   181	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\therself, began scolding one of her daughters.
   182	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   183	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Don’t keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven’s sake! Have a little
   184	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcompassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.”
   185	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   186	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,” said her father; “she times
   187	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthem ill.”
   188	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   189	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I do not cough for my own amusement,” replied Kitty fretfully. “When is
   190	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyour next ball to be, Lizzy?”
   191	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   192	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“To-morrow fortnight.”
   193	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   194	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Aye, so it is,” cried her mother, “and Mrs. Long does not come back
   195	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttill the day before; so it will be impossible for her to introduce him,
   196	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor she will not know him herself.”
   197	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   198	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce
   199	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Bingley to _her_.”
   200	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   201	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him
   202	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmyself; how can you be so teasing?”
   203	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   204	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I honour your circumspection. A fortnight’s acquaintance is certainly
   205	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvery little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a
   206	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfortnight. But if _we_ do not venture somebody else will; and after all,
   207	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Long and her neices must stand their chance; and, therefore, as
   208	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I will
   209	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttake it on myself.”
   210	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   211	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, “Nonsense,
   212	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnonsense!”
   213	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   214	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?” cried he. “Do
   215	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on
   216	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthem, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_. What say you,
   217	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read
   218	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgreat books and make extracts.”
   219	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   220	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.
   221	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   222	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“While Mary is adjusting her ideas,” he continued, “let us return to Mr.
   223	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBingley.”
   224	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   225	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I am sick of Mr. Bingley,” cried his wife.
   226	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   227	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me that before? If
   228	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called
   229	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ton him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we
   230	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcannot escape the acquaintance now.”
   231	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   232	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs.
   233	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first tumult of joy
   234	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the
   235	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhile.
   236	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   237	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should
   238	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpersuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to
   239	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tneglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a
   240	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgood joke, too, that you should have gone this morning and never said a
   241	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tword about it till now.”
   242	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   243	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,” said Mr. Bennet; and,
   244	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.
   245	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   246	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“What an excellent father you have, girls!” said she, when the door was
   247	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshut. “I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness;
   248	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tor me, either, for that matter. At our time of life it is not so
   249	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but
   250	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor your sakes, we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_
   251	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next
   252	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tball.”
   253	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   254	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh!” said Lydia stoutly, “I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the
   255	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyoungest, I’m the tallest.”
   256	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   257	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would
   258	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treturn Mr. Bennet’s visit, and determining when they should ask him to
   259	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdinner.
   260	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t

   263	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tChapter 3
   264	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   265	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   266	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tNot all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five
   267	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdaughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her
   268	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thusband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him
   269	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin various ways--with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and
   270	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdistant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at
   271	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlast obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour,
   272	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLady Lucas. Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been
   273	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdelighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely
   274	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tagreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly
   275	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of
   276	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively
   277	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thopes of Mr. Bingley’s heart were entertained.
   278	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   279	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,”
   280	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, “and all the others equally well
   281	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmarried, I shall have nothing to wish for.”
   282	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   283	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIn a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet’s visit, and sat about
   284	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being
   285	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tadmitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had
   286	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\theard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more
   287	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper
   288	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twindow that he wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse.
   289	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   290	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAn invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already
   291	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her
   292	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thousekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley
   293	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable
   294	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite
   295	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdisconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town
   296	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tso soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that
   297	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\the might be always flying about from one place to another, and never
   298	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsettled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears
   299	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get
   300	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley
   301	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.
   302	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the
   303	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tday before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only
   304	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsix with him from London--his five sisters and a cousin. And when
   305	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five
   306	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taltogether--Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and
   307	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tanother young man.
   308	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   309	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant
   310	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcountenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,
   311	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely
   312	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlooked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention
   313	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and
   314	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe report which was in general circulation within five minutes
   315	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tafter his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen
   316	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he
   317	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great
   318	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tadmiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust
   319	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhich turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be
   320	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tproud; to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all
   321	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most
   322	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tforbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared
   323	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith his friend.
   324	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   325	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal
   326	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpeople in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,
   327	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving
   328	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tone himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for
   329	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthemselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced
   330	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tonly once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being
   331	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tintroduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in
   332	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twalking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.
   333	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHis character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man
   334	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.
   335	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAmongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of
   336	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his
   337	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thaving slighted one of her daughters.
   338	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   339	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit
   340	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdown for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been
   341	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tstanding near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr.
   342	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend
   343	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto join it.
   344	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   345	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Come, Darcy,” said he, “I must have you dance. I hate to see you
   346	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tstanding about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better
   347	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdance.”
   348	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   349	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am
   350	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tparticularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this
   351	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not
   352	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tanother woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to
   353	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tstand up with.”
   354	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   355	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I would not be so fastidious as you are,” cried Mr. Bingley, “for a
   356	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tkingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in
   357	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmy life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see
   358	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tuncommonly pretty.”
   359	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   360	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,” said Mr.
   361	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tDarcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.
   362	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   363	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one
   364	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I
   365	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.”
   366	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   367	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Which do you mean?” and turning round he looked for a moment at
   368	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said:
   369	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“She is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; I am in no
   370	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thumour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted
   371	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tby other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her
   372	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsmiles, for you are wasting your time with me.”
   373	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   374	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth
   375	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tremained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She told the story,
   376	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thowever, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively,
   377	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tplayful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous.
   378	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   379	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.
   380	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield
   381	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tparty. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been
   382	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdistinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as
   383	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane’s
   384	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most
   385	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taccomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been
   386	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all that they
   387	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good
   388	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tspirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they
   389	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twere the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With
   390	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a
   391	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgood deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised
   392	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuch splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that his wife’s views on
   393	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a
   394	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdifferent story to hear.
   395	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   396	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh! my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a most
   397	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdelightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.
   398	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tJane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well
   399	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with
   400	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther twice! Only think of _that_, my dear; he actually danced with her
   401	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttwice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second
   402	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttime. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand
   403	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tup with her! But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody
   404	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcan, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going
   405	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdown the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and
   406	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tasked her for the two next. Then the two third he danced with Miss King,
   407	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again,
   408	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand the two sixth with Lizzy, and the _Boulanger_--”
   409	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   410	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“If he had had any compassion for _me_,” cried her husband impatiently,
   411	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“he would not have danced half so much! For God’s sake, say no more of
   412	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this partners. Oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance!”
   413	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   414	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively
   415	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thandsome! And his sisters are charming women. I never in my life saw
   416	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tanything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs.
   417	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHurst’s gown--”
   418	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   419	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHere she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any
   420	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdescription of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch
   421	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some
   422	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.
   423	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   424	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“But I can assure you,” she added, “that Lizzy does not lose much by not
   425	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at
   426	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tall worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring
   427	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very
   428	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgreat! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my
   429	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.”
   430	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t

   434	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   435	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   436	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWhen Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in
   437	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister just how very
   438	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmuch she admired him.
   439	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   440	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“He is just what a young man ought to be,” said she, “sensible,
   441	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgood-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much
   442	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tease, with such perfect good breeding!”
   443	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   444	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“He is also handsome,” replied Elizabeth, “which a young man ought
   445	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlikewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.”
   446	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   447	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I
   448	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdid not expect such a compliment.”
   449	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   450	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Did not you? I did for you. But that is one great difference between
   451	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tus. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never. What
   452	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcould be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help
   453	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tseeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman
   454	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is
   455	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvery agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a
   456	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tstupider person.”
   457	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   458	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Dear Lizzy!”
   459	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   460	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.
   461	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tYou never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable
   462	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in your
   463	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlife.”
   464	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   465	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak
   466	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhat I think.”
   467	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   468	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With _your_
   469	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgood sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of
   470	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tothers! Affectation of candour is common enough--one meets with it
   471	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teverywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design--to take the
   472	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgood of everybody’s character and make it still better, and say nothing
   473	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof the bad--belongs to you alone. And so you like this man’s sisters,
   474	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttoo, do you? Their manners are not equal to his.”
   475	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   476	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Certainly not--at first. But they are very pleasing women when you
   477	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconverse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep
   478	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming
   479	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tneighbour in her.”
   480	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   481	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at
   482	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more
   483	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tquickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister,
   484	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand with a judgement too unassailed by any attention to herself, she
   485	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas very little disposed to approve them. They were in fact very fine
   486	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tladies; not deficient in good humour when they were pleased, nor in the
   487	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpower of making themselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and
   488	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconceited. They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the
   489	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfirst private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand
   490	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and of
   491	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tassociating with people of rank, and were therefore in every respect
   492	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tentitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of others. They were of
   493	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply
   494	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timpressed on their memories than that their brother’s fortune and their
   495	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\town had been acquired by trade.
   496	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   497	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred
   498	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an
   499	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\testate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and
   500	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a
   501	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgood house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those
   502	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twho best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the
   503	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tremainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to
   504	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpurchase.
   505	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   506	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHis sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but,
   507	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthough he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no
   508	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmeans unwilling to preside at his table--nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had
   509	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmarried a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider
   510	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of
   511	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tage two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation
   512	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it for
   513	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thalf-an-hour--was pleased with the situation and the principal
   514	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it
   515	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timmediately.
   516	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   517	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBetween him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of
   518	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgreat opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the
   519	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teasiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition
   520	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcould offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he
   521	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnever appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy’s regard, Bingley
   522	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion.
   523	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIn understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means
   524	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdeficient, but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty,
   525	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not
   526	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley
   527	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually
   528	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgiving offense.
   529	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   530	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently
   531	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcharacteristic. Bingley had never met with more pleasant people or
   532	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tprettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive
   533	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt
   534	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tacquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could not
   535	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a
   536	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcollection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for
   537	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnone of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received
   538	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teither attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty,
   539	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbut she smiled too much.
   540	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   541	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so--but still they admired
   542	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one
   543	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhom they would not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore
   544	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\testablished as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorized by such
   545	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcommendation to think of her as he chose.
   546	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t

   550	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   551	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   552	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWithin a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets
   553	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twere particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade
   554	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the
   555	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thonour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty.
   556	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly. It had given him a
   557	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdisgust to his business, and to his residence in a small market town;
   558	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand, in quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house
   559	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tabout a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge,
   560	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhere he could think with pleasure of his own importance, and,
   561	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunshackled by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all
   562	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe world. For, though elated by his rank, it did not render him
   563	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsupercilious; on the contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By
   564	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St.
   565	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tJames’s had made him courteous.
   566	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   567	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a
   568	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvaluable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest
   569	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was
   570	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth’s intimate friend.
   571	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   572	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThat the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over
   573	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly
   574	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbrought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.
   575	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   576	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,” said Mrs. Bennet with civil
   577	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tself-command to Miss Lucas. “_You_ were Mr. Bingley’s first choice.”
   578	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   579	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.”
   580	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   581	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To be
   582	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed I rather believe he
   583	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something
   584	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tabout Mr. Robinson.”
   585	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   586	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson; did not
   587	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI mention it to you? Mr. Robinson’s asking him how he liked our Meryton
   588	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tassemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many
   589	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpretty women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his
   590	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tanswering immediately to the last question: ‘Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet,
   591	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeyond a doubt; there cannot be two opinions on that point.’”
   592	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   593	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Upon my word! Well, that is very decided indeed--that does seem as
   594	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tif--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.”
   595	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   596	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,” said
   597	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCharlotte. “Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,
   598	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tis he?--poor Eliza!--to be only just _tolerable_.”
   599	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   600	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I beg you would not put it into Lizzy’s head to be vexed by his
   601	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\till-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man, that it would be quite
   602	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he
   603	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsat close to her for half-an-hour without once opening his lips.”
   604	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   605	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Are you quite sure, ma’am?--is not there a little mistake?” said Jane.
   606	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.”
   607	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   608	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Aye--because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he
   609	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcould not help answering her; but she said he seemed quite angry at
   610	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeing spoke to.”
   611	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   612	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Miss Bingley told me,” said Jane, “that he never speaks much,
   613	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunless among his intimate acquaintances. With _them_ he is remarkably
   614	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tagreeable.”
   615	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   616	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very
   617	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tagreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it
   618	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had
   619	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\theard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had come to
   620	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe ball in a hack chaise.”
   621	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   622	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,” said Miss Lucas, “but I
   623	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twish he had danced with Eliza.”
   624	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   625	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Another time, Lizzy,” said her mother, “I would not dance with _him_,
   626	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tif I were you.”
   627	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   628	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I believe, ma’am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him.”
   629	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   630	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“His pride,” said Miss Lucas, “does not offend _me_ so much as pride
   631	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\toften does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so
   632	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvery fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,
   633	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshould think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a _right_
   634	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto be proud.”
   635	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   636	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“That is very true,” replied Elizabeth, “and I could easily forgive
   637	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.”
   638	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   639	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her
   640	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treflections, “is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have
   641	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human
   642	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us
   643	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twho do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some
   644	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tquality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different
   645	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthings, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may
   646	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of
   647	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.”
   648	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   649	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,” cried a young Lucas, who came with
   650	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this sisters, “I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of
   651	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfoxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day.”
   652	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   653	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,” said Mrs.
   654	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBennet; “and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle
   655	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdirectly.”
   656	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   657	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she
   658	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twould, and the argument ended only with the visit.
   659	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   660	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   661	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   662	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tChapter 6
   663	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   664	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   665	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The visit
   666	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas soon returned in due form. Miss Bennet’s pleasing manners grew on
   667	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and though the mother was
   668	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfound to be intolerable, and the younger sisters not worth speaking to,
   669	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta wish of being better acquainted with _them_ was expressed towards
   670	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe two eldest. By Jane, this attention was received with the greatest
   671	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpleasure, but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment
   672	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof everybody, hardly excepting even her sister, and could not like them;
   673	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthough their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in
   674	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tall probability from the influence of their brother’s admiration. It
   675	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas generally evident whenever they met, that he _did_ admire her and
   676	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto _her_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference
   677	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhich she had begun to entertain for him from the first, and was in a
   678	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tway to be very much in love; but she considered with pleasure that it
   679	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas not likely to be discovered by the world in general, since Jane
   680	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunited, with great strength of feeling, a composure of temper and a
   681	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tuniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions
   682	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof the impertinent. She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.
   683	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   684	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“It may perhaps be pleasant,” replied Charlotte, “to be able to impose
   685	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ton the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be
   686	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tso very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill
   687	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfrom the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and
   688	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in
   689	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every
   690	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tattachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all
   691	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are
   692	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvery few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without
   693	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tencouragement. In nine cases out of ten a women had better show _more_
   694	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taffection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he
   695	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmay never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”
   696	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   697	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If I can
   698	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tperceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed, not to
   699	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdiscover it too.”
   700	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   701	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane’s disposition as you do.”
   702	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   703	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal
   704	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit, he must find it out.”
   705	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   706	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley and Jane
   707	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmeet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as they
   708	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\talways see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that
   709	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tevery moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should
   710	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttherefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can command his
   711	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tattention. When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure for
   712	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfalling in love as much as she chooses.”
   713	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   714	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Your plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is in
   715	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tquestion but the desire of being well married, and if I were determined
   716	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But
   717	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthese are not Jane’s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet,
   718	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its
   719	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four
   720	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,
   721	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand has since dined with him in company four times. This is not quite
   722	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tenough to make her understand his character.”
   723	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   724	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might
   725	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tonly have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must
   726	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tremember that four evenings have also been spent together--and four
   727	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tevenings may do a great deal.”
   728	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   729	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they
   730	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tboth like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other
   731	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tleading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.”
   732	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   733	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart; and
   734	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tif she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a
   735	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tchance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a
   736	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttwelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If
   737	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or
   738	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the
   739	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tleast. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to
   740	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thave their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as
   741	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpossible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your
   742	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlife.”
   743	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   744	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not
   745	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”
   746	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   747	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tOccupied in observing Mr. Bingley’s attentions to her sister, Elizabeth
   748	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some
   749	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinterest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely
   750	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tallowed her to be pretty; he had looked at her without admiration at the
   751	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no
   752	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she hardly
   753	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered
   754	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tuncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To
   755	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthis discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had
   756	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdetected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry
   757	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and
   758	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those
   759	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of
   760	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthis she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made
   761	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thimself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough
   762	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto dance with.
   763	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   764	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHe began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing
   765	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so
   766	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdrew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas’s, where a large party were
   767	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tassembled.
   768	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   769	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“What does Mr. Darcy mean,” said she to Charlotte, “by listening to my
   770	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconversation with Colonel Forster?”
   771	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   772	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.”
   773	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   774	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see
   775	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhat he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by
   776	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeing impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.”
   777	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   778	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tOn his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have
   779	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tany intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such
   780	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta subject to him; which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she
   781	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tturned to him and said:
   782	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   783	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly
   784	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twell just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at
   785	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMeryton?”
   786	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   787	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady
   788	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tenergetic.”
   789	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   790	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You are severe on us.”
   791	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   792	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“It will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,” said Miss Lucas. “I am going
   793	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.”
   794	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   795	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!--always wanting me
   796	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my vanity had taken
   797	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would
   798	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treally rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of
   799	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thearing the very best performers.” On Miss Lucas’s persevering, however,
   800	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe added, “Very well, if it must be so, it must.” And gravely glancing
   801	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tat Mr. Darcy, “There is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of
   802	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcourse familiar with: ‘Keep your breath to cool your porridge’; and I
   803	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshall keep mine to swell my song.”
   804	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   805	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHer performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song
   806	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tor two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that
   807	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her
   808	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in
   809	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always
   810	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timpatient for display.
   811	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   812	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her
   813	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tapplication, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited
   814	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmanner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she
   815	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with
   816	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmuch more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the
   817	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tend of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by
   818	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tScotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who,
   819	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in
   820	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdancing at one end of the room.
   821	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   822	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of
   823	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpassing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too
   824	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmuch engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was
   825	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this neighbour, till Sir William thus began:
   826	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   827	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There
   828	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tis nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of the first
   829	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trefinements of polished society.”
   830	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   831	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst
   832	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe less polished societies of the world. Every savage can dance.”
   833	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   834	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tSir William only smiled. “Your friend performs delightfully,” he
   835	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcontinued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; “and I doubt
   836	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.”
   837	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   838	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.”
   839	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   840	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do
   841	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou often dance at St. James’s?”
   842	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   843	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Never, sir.”
   844	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   845	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?”
   846	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   847	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.”
   848	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   849	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You have a house in town, I conclude?”
   850	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   851	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Darcy bowed.
   852	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   853	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself--for I am fond
   854	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of
   855	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLondon would agree with Lady Lucas.”
   856	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   857	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHe paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed
   858	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was
   859	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tstruck with the action of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to
   860	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther:
   861	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   862	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“My dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow
   863	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tme to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You
   864	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcannot refuse to dance, I am sure when so much beauty is before you.”
   865	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy who, though
   866	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\textremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly
   867	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdrew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William:
   868	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   869	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you
   870	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.”
   871	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   872	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of
   873	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at
   874	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tall shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.
   875	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   876	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny
   877	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tme the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the
   878	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tamusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us
   879	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor one half-hour.”
   880	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   881	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Mr. Darcy is all politeness,” said Elizabeth, smiling.
   882	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   883	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“He is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza,
   884	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twe cannot wonder at his complaisance--for who would object to such a
   885	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpartner?”
   886	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   887	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not
   888	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinjured her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some
   889	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcomplacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley:
   890	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   891	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I can guess the subject of your reverie.”
   892	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   893	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I should imagine not.”
   894	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   895	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings
   896	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin this manner--in such society; and indeed I am quite of your opinion.
   897	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the noise--the
   898	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnothingness, and yet the self-importance of all those people! What would
   899	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI give to hear your strictures on them!”
   900	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   901	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more
   902	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tagreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure
   903	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhich a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.”
   904	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   905	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMiss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he
   906	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twould tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.
   907	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity:
   908	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   909	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Miss Elizabeth Bennet.”
   910	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   911	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Miss Elizabeth Bennet!” repeated Miss Bingley. “I am all astonishment.
   912	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHow long has she been such a favourite?--and pray, when am I to wish you
   913	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tjoy?”
   914	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   915	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady’s
   916	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love
   917	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.”
   918	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   919	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Nay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter is
   920	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tabsolutely settled. You will be having a charming mother-in-law, indeed;
   921	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand, of course, she will always be at Pemberley with you.”
   922	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   923	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHe listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to
   924	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tentertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her
   925	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat all was safe, her wit flowed long.
   926	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   927	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   928	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   929	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tChapter 7
   930	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   931	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   932	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Bennet’s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two
   933	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,
   934	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother’s
   935	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply
   936	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and
   937	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad left her four thousand pounds.
   938	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   939	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk to
   940	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttheir father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in
   941	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLondon in a respectable line of trade.
   942	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   943	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most
   944	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconvenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted
   945	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and
   946	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto a milliner’s shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family,
   947	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCatherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions;
   948	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttheir minds were more vacant than their sisters’, and when nothing
   949	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbetter offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning
   950	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news
   951	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some
   952	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfrom their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with
   953	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnews and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the
   954	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tneighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the
   955	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\theadquarters.
   956	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   957	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tTheir visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most
   958	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinteresting intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge
   959	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof the officers’ names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a
   960	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsecret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr.
   961	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tPhillips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a store of
   962	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfelicity unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and
   963	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Bingley’s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation
   964	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the
   965	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tregimentals of an ensign.
   966	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   967	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAfter listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.
   968	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBennet coolly observed:
   969	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   970	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two
   971	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but
   972	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI am now convinced.”
   973	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   974	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCatherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect
   975	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tindifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter,
   976	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the
   977	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnext morning to London.
   978	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   979	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I am astonished, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that you should be so
   980	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly
   981	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof anybody’s children, it should not be of my own, however.”
   982	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   983	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.”
   984	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   985	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes--but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.”
   986	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   987	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I
   988	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must
   989	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tso far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly
   990	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfoolish.”
   991	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
   992	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of
   993	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttheir father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they will
   994	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when
   995	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI liked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at my
   996	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\theart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,
   997	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshould want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him; and I thought
   998	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tColonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William’s in
   999	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this regimentals.”
  1000	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1001	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Mamma,” cried Lydia, “my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain
  1002	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCarter do not go so often to Miss Watson’s as they did when they first
  1003	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcame; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke’s library.”
  1004	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1005	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with
  1006	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited
  1007	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor an answer. Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was
  1008	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teagerly calling out, while her daughter read,
  1009	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1010	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well,
  1011	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tJane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.”
  1012	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1013	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“It is from Miss Bingley,” said Jane, and then read it aloud.
  1014	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1015	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“MY DEAR FRIEND,--
  1016	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1017	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me,
  1018	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twe shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives,
  1019	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor a whole day’s tete-a-tete between two women can never end without a
  1020	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tquarrel. Come as soon as you can on receipt of this. My brother and the
  1021	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgentlemen are to dine with the officers.--Yours ever,
  1022	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1023	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“CAROLINE BINGLEY”
  1024	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1025	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“With the officers!” cried Lydia. “I wonder my aunt did not tell us of
  1026	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t_that_.”
  1027	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1028	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Dining out,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that is very unlucky.”
  1029	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1030	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Can I have the carriage?” said Jane.
  1031	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1032	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to
  1033	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\train; and then you must stay all night.”
  1034	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1035	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“That would be a good scheme,” said Elizabeth, “if you were sure that
  1036	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthey would not offer to send her home.”
  1037	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1038	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley’s chaise to go to Meryton,
  1039	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand the Hursts have no horses to theirs.”
  1040	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1041	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I had much rather go in the coach.”
  1042	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1043	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure. They are
  1044	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?”
  1045	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1046	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.”
  1047	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1048	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“But if you have got them to-day,” said Elizabeth, “my mother’s purpose
  1049	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twill be answered.”
  1050	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1051	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses
  1052	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twere engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her
  1053	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a
  1054	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbad day. Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before
  1055	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was
  1056	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdelighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;
  1057	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tJane certainly could not come back.
  1058	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1059	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!” said Mrs. Bennet more than
  1060	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tonce, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the
  1061	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnext morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her
  1062	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcontrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield
  1063	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbrought the following note for Elizabeth:
  1064	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1065	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“MY DEAREST LIZZY,--
  1066	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1067	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be
  1068	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will not
  1069	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thear of my returning till I am better. They insist also on my seeing Mr.
  1070	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tJones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been
  1071	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto me--and, excepting a sore throat and headache, there is not much the
  1072	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmatter with me.--Yours, etc.”
  1073	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1074	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Well, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note
  1075	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taloud, “if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if she
  1076	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshould die, it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of
  1077	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Bingley, and under your orders.”
  1078	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1079	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh! I am not afraid of her dying. People do not die of little trifling
  1080	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcolds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays there, it is
  1081	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tall very well. I would go and see her if I could have the carriage.”
  1082	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1083	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her, though
  1084	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe carriage was not to be had; and as she was no horsewoman, walking
  1085	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas her only alternative. She declared her resolution.
  1086	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1087	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“How can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as to think of such a
  1088	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get
  1089	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthere.”
  1090	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1091	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want.”
  1092	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1093	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,” said her father, “to send for the
  1094	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thorses?”
  1095	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1096	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing
  1097	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhen one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.”
  1098	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1099	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I admire the activity of your benevolence,” observed Mary, “but every
  1100	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timpulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,
  1101	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texertion should always be in proportion to what is required.”
  1102	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1103	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“We will go as far as Meryton with you,” said Catherine and Lydia.
  1104	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off
  1105	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttogether.
  1106	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1107	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“If we make haste,” said Lydia, as they walked along, “perhaps we may
  1108	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsee something of Captain Carter before he goes.”
  1109	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1110	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIn Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one
  1111	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof the officers’ wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing
  1112	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfield after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing
  1113	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tover puddles with impatient activity, and finding herself at last
  1114	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twithin view of the house, with weary ankles, dirty stockings, and a face
  1115	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tglowing with the warmth of exercise.
  1116	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1117	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were
  1118	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tassembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.
  1119	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThat she should have walked three miles so early in the day, in such
  1120	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and
  1121	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMiss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt
  1122	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their
  1123	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbrother’s manners there was something better than politeness; there
  1124	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas good humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr.
  1125	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHurst nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the
  1126	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbrilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion, and doubt as
  1127	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto the occasion’s justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was
  1128	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthinking only of his breakfast.
  1129	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1130	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHer inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss
  1131	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not
  1132	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twell enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her
  1133	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timmediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving
  1134	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\talarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed
  1135	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,
  1136	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thowever, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them
  1137	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttogether, could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the
  1138	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\textraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended
  1139	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther.
  1140	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1141	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWhen breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth
  1142	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbegan to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and
  1143	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsolicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having
  1144	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texamined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught
  1145	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;
  1146	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tadvised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice
  1147	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head
  1148	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment; nor were
  1149	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had, in
  1150	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfact, nothing to do elsewhere.
  1151	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1152	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWhen the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very
  1153	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only
  1154	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern
  1155	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer
  1156	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present.
  1157	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to
  1158	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLongbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply
  1159	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof clothes.
  1160	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1161	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1162	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1163	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tChapter 8
  1164	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1165	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1166	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAt five o’clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six
  1167	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then
  1168	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpoured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the
  1169	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmuch superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley’s, she could not make a very
  1170	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfavourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing
  1171	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthis, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how
  1172	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked
  1173	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeing ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their
  1174	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tindifference towards Jane when not immediately before them restored
  1175	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike.
  1176	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1177	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tTheir brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could
  1178	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tregard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his
  1179	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tattentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling
  1180	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\therself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the
  1181	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tothers. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was
  1182	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tengrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.
  1183	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to
  1184	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teat, drink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to prefer a plain
  1185	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.
  1186	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1187	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWhen dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley
  1188	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbegan abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were
  1189	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride and impertinence;
  1190	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe had no conversation, no style, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst thought the
  1191	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsame, and added:
  1192	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1193	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent
  1194	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twalker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really
  1195	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlooked almost wild.”
  1196	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1197	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“She did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very
  1198	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the
  1199	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcountry, because her sister had a cold? Her hair, so untidy, so blowsy!”
  1200	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1201	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep
  1202	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been let down to
  1203	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thide it not doing its office.”
  1204	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1205	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said Bingley; “but this was
  1206	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tall lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably
  1207	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twell when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite
  1208	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tescaped my notice.”
  1209	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1210	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley; “and I am
  1211	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinclined to think that you would not wish to see _your_ sister make such
  1212	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tan exhibition.”
  1213	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1214	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Certainly not.”
  1215	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1216	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,
  1217	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tabove her ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! What could she mean by
  1218	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,
  1219	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta most country-town indifference to decorum.”
  1220	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1221	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,” said
  1222	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBingley.
  1223	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1224	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,” observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper, “that
  1225	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthis adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes.”
  1226	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1227	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Not at all,” he replied; “they were brightened by the exercise.” A
  1228	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshort pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again:
  1229	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1230	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a very
  1231	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with
  1232	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuch a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is
  1233	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tno chance of it.”
  1234	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1235	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in
  1236	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMeryton.”
  1237	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1238	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.”
  1239	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1240	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“That is capital,” added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.
  1241	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1242	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,” cried Bingley, “it
  1243	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twould not make them one jot less agreeable.”
  1244	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1245	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any
  1246	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconsideration in the world,” replied Darcy.
  1247	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1248	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tTo this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their
  1249	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of
  1250	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttheir dear friend’s vulgar relations.
  1251	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1252	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWith a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her room on
  1253	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tleaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.
  1254	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till
  1255	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlate in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep, and
  1256	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhen it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go
  1257	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdownstairs herself. On entering the drawing-room she found the whole
  1258	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tparty at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting
  1259	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthem to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the
  1260	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texcuse, said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay
  1261	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbelow, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.
  1262	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1263	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “that is rather singular.”
  1264	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1265	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Miss Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, “despises cards. She is a great
  1266	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treader, and has no pleasure in anything else.”
  1267	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1268	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried Elizabeth; “I am
  1269	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t_not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.”
  1270	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1271	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,” said Bingley; “and
  1272	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well.”
  1273	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1274	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards the
  1275	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttable where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her
  1276	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tothers--all that his library afforded.
  1277	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1278	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own
  1279	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcredit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I have more
  1280	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthan I ever looked into.”
  1281	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1282	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those
  1283	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin the room.
  1284	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1285	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I am astonished,” said Miss Bingley, “that my father should have left
  1286	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tso small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at
  1287	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tPemberley, Mr. Darcy!”
  1288	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1289	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“It ought to be good,” he replied, “it has been the work of many
  1290	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgenerations.”
  1291	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1292	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always buying
  1293	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbooks.”
  1294	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1295	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as
  1296	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthese.”
  1297	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1298	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of
  1299	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat noble place. Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be
  1300	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thalf as delightful as Pemberley.”
  1301	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1302	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I wish it may.”
  1303	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1304	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that
  1305	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tneighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a
  1306	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfiner county in England than Derbyshire.”
  1307	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1308	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it.”
  1309	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1310	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I am talking of possibilities, Charles.”
  1311	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1312	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get
  1313	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tPemberley by purchase than by imitation.”
  1314	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1315	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her very
  1316	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlittle attention for her book; and soon laying it wholly aside, she drew
  1317	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnear the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his
  1318	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teldest sister, to observe the game.
  1319	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1320	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?” said Miss Bingley; “will
  1321	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe be as tall as I am?”
  1322	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1323	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet’s height, or
  1324	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trather taller.”
  1325	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1326	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me
  1327	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tso much. Such a countenance, such manners! And so extremely accomplished
  1328	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.”
  1329	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1330	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“It is amazing to me,” said Bingley, “how young ladies can have patience
  1331	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto be so very accomplished as they all are.”
  1332	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1333	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?”
  1334	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1335	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and
  1336	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnet purses. I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this, and I am sure
  1337	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without being
  1338	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinformed that she was very accomplished.”
  1339	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1340	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,” said Darcy, “has
  1341	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttoo much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no
  1342	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\totherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen. But I am very
  1343	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfar from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I
  1344	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my
  1345	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tacquaintance, that are really accomplished.”
  1346	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1347	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Nor I, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley.
  1348	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1349	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Then,” observed Elizabeth, “you must comprehend a great deal in your
  1350	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tidea of an accomplished woman.”
  1351	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1352	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it.”
  1353	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1354	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh! certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be really
  1355	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\testeemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met
  1356	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,
  1357	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and besides
  1358	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tall this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of
  1359	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twalking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word
  1360	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twill be but half-deserved.”
  1361	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1362	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“All this she must possess,” added Darcy, “and to all this she must
  1363	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyet add something more substantial, in the improvement of her mind by
  1364	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\textensive reading.”
  1365	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1366	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.
  1367	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.”
  1368	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1369	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all
  1370	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthis?”
  1371	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1372	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I never saw such a woman. I never saw such capacity, and taste, and
  1373	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tapplication, and elegance, as you describe united.”
  1374	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1375	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her
  1376	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timplied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who
  1377	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tanswered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with
  1378	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all
  1379	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the
  1380	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\troom.
  1381	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1382	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Elizabeth Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her,
  1383	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the
  1384	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tother sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it
  1385	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsucceeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.”
  1386	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1387	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Undoubtedly,” replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,
  1388	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“there is a meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend
  1389	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is
  1390	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdespicable.”
  1391	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1392	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMiss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to
  1393	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcontinue the subject.
  1394	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1395	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and
  1396	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones being sent for
  1397	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timmediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could
  1398	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most
  1399	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so
  1400	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunwilling to comply with their brother’s proposal; and it was settled
  1401	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet
  1402	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twere not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters
  1403	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdeclared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,
  1404	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thowever, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief
  1405	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every
  1406	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tattention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.
  1407	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1408	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1409	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1410	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tChapter 9
  1411	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1412	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1413	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister’s room, and in the
  1414	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmorning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the
  1415	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,
  1416	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his
  1417	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a
  1418	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnote sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her
  1419	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\town judgement of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and
  1420	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tits contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her
  1421	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttwo youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.
  1422	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1423	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHad she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been
  1424	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvery miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was
  1425	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her
  1426	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trestoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She
  1427	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twould not listen, therefore, to her daughter’s proposal of being carried
  1428	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thome; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think
  1429	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss
  1430	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBingley’s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all
  1431	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tattended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes
  1432	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.
  1433	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1434	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Indeed I have, sir,” was her answer. “She is a great deal too ill to be
  1435	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmoved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass
  1436	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta little longer on your kindness.”
  1437	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1438	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Removed!” cried Bingley. “It must not be thought of. My sister, I am
  1439	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsure, will not hear of her removal.”
  1440	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1441	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You may depend upon it, Madam,” said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,
  1442	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while she
  1443	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tremains with us.”
  1444	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1445	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.
  1446	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1447	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I am sure,” she added, “if it was not for such good friends I do not
  1448	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tknow what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers
  1449	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is
  1450	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\talways the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest
  1451	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttemper I have ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are
  1452	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnothing to _her_. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a
  1453	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcharming prospect over the gravel walk. I do not know a place in the
  1454	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcountry that is equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it
  1455	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin a hurry, I hope, though you have but a short lease.”
  1456	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1457	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Whatever I do is done in a hurry,” replied he; “and therefore if I
  1458	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshould resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five
  1459	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tminutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.”
  1460	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1461	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,” said Elizabeth.
  1462	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1463	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You begin to comprehend me, do you?” cried he, turning towards her.
  1464	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1465	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh! yes--I understand you perfectly.”
  1466	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1467	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen
  1468	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthrough I am afraid is pitiful.”
  1469	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1470	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“That is as it happens. It does not follow that a deep, intricate
  1471	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcharacter is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.”
  1472	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1473	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Lizzy,” cried her mother, “remember where you are, and do not run on in
  1474	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.”
  1475	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1476	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I did not know before,” continued Bingley immediately, “that you were a
  1477	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tstudier of character. It must be an amusing study.”
  1478	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1479	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes, but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have at
  1480	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tleast that advantage.”
  1481	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1482	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“The country,” said Darcy, “can in general supply but a few subjects for
  1483	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuch a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and
  1484	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunvarying society.”
  1485	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1486	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be
  1487	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tobserved in them for ever.”
  1488	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1489	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes, indeed,” cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning
  1490	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta country neighbourhood. “I assure you there is quite as much of _that_
  1491	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgoing on in the country as in town.”
  1492	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1493	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tEverybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,
  1494	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tturned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete
  1495	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvictory over him, continued her triumph.
  1496	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1497	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for
  1498	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmy part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal
  1499	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?”
  1500	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1501	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“When I am in the country,” he replied, “I never wish to leave it;
  1502	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have each their
  1503	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tadvantages, and I can be equally happy in either.”
  1504	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1505	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Aye--that is because you have the right disposition. But that
  1506	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgentleman,” looking at Darcy, “seemed to think the country was nothing
  1507	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tat all.”
  1508	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1509	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken,” said Elizabeth, blushing for her
  1510	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmother. “You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not
  1511	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuch a variety of people to be met with in the country as in the town,
  1512	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhich you must acknowledge to be true.”
  1513	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1514	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting
  1515	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few
  1516	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tneighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.”
  1517	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1518	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tNothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his
  1519	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcountenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eyes towards
  1520	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of
  1521	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsaying something that might turn her mother’s thoughts, now asked her if
  1522	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCharlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.
  1523	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1524	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir
  1525	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWilliam is, Mr. Bingley, is not he? So much the man of fashion! So
  1526	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgenteel and easy! He has always something to say to everybody. _That_
  1527	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tis my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very
  1528	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timportant, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter.”
  1529	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1530	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Did Charlotte dine with you?”
  1531	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1532	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For
  1533	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmy part, Mr. Bingley, I always keep servants that can do their own work;
  1534	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t_my_ daughters are brought up very differently. But everybody is to
  1535	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tjudge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls,
  1536	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that I think
  1537	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCharlotte so _very_ plain--but then she is our particular friend.”
  1538	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1539	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“She seems a very pleasant young woman.”
  1540	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1541	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself
  1542	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thas often said so, and envied me Jane’s beauty. I do not like to boast
  1543	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof my own child, but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see anybody
  1544	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbetter looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own
  1545	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpartiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother
  1546	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tGardiner’s in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was
  1547	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsure he would make her an offer before we came away. But, however, he
  1548	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdid not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he wrote some verses
  1549	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ton her, and very pretty they were.”
  1550	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1551	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And so ended his affection,” said Elizabeth impatiently. “There has
  1552	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeen many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first
  1553	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdiscovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!”
  1554	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1555	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,” said Darcy.
  1556	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1557	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is
  1558	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tstrong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I
  1559	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tam convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.”
  1560	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1561	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tDarcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth
  1562	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to
  1563	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tspeak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.
  1564	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to
  1565	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tJane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was
  1566	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be
  1567	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcivil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part
  1568	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tindeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and
  1569	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsoon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of
  1570	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to
  1571	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teach other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the
  1572	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyoungest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming
  1573	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinto the country to give a ball at Netherfield.
  1574	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1575	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion
  1576	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose
  1577	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taffection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high
  1578	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tanimal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the
  1579	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tattention of the officers, to whom her uncle’s good dinners, and her own
  1580	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teasy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very
  1581	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tequal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and
  1582	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tabruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most
  1583	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to this
  1584	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsudden attack was delightful to their mother’s ear:
  1585	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1586	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when
  1587	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyour sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of
  1588	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe ball. But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill.”
  1589	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1590	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLydia declared herself satisfied. “Oh! yes--it would be much better to
  1591	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter
  1592	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twould be at Meryton again. And when you have given _your_ ball,” she
  1593	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tadded, “I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel
  1594	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tForster it will be quite a shame if he does not.”
  1595	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1596	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned
  1597	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinstantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations’ behaviour to the
  1598	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tremarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however,
  1599	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcould not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of
  1600	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tall Miss Bingley’s witticisms on _fine eyes_.
  1601	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1602	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1603	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1604	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tChapter 10
  1605	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1606	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1607	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss
  1608	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who
  1609	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcontinued, though slowly, to mend; and in the evening Elizabeth joined
  1610	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttheir party in the drawing-room. The loo-table, however, did not appear.
  1611	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching
  1612	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by
  1613	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmessages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and
  1614	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Hurst was observing their game.
  1615	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1616	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in
  1617	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tattending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual
  1618	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcommendations of the lady, either on his handwriting, or on the evenness
  1619	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern
  1620	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was
  1621	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texactly in union with her opinion of each.
  1622	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1623	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!”
  1624	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1625	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHe made no answer.
  1626	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1627	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You write uncommonly fast.”
  1628	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1629	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.”
  1630	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1631	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a
  1632	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyear! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!”
  1633	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1634	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours.”
  1635	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1636	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.”
  1637	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1638	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I have already told her so once, by your desire.”
  1639	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1640	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend
  1641	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpens remarkably well.”
  1642	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1643	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Thank you--but I always mend my own.”
  1644	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1645	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“How can you contrive to write so even?”
  1646	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1647	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHe was silent.
  1648	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1649	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp;
  1650	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful
  1651	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlittle design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss
  1652	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tGrantley’s.”
  1653	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1654	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At
  1655	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpresent I have not room to do them justice.”
  1656	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1657	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you
  1658	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\talways write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?”
  1659	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1660	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for me
  1661	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto determine.”
  1662	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1663	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with
  1664	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tease, cannot write ill.”
  1665	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1666	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,” cried her
  1667	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbrother, “because he does _not_ write with ease. He studies too much for
  1668	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twords of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?”
  1669	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1670	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“My style of writing is very different from yours.”
  1671	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1672	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh!” cried Miss Bingley, “Charles writes in the most careless way
  1673	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.”
  1674	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1675	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them--by which
  1676	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmeans my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.”
  1677	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1678	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Your humility, Mr. Bingley,” said Elizabeth, “must disarm reproof.”
  1679	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1680	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Nothing is more deceitful,” said Darcy, “than the appearance of
  1681	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thumility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an
  1682	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tindirect boast.”
  1683	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1684	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?”
  1685	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1686	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in
  1687	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twriting, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of
  1688	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you
  1689	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthink at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with
  1690	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tquickness is always prized much by the possessor, and often without any
  1691	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tattention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.
  1692	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBennet this morning that if you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield
  1693	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of
  1694	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpanegyric, of compliment to yourself--and yet what is there so very
  1695	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlaudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business
  1696	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tundone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?”
  1697	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1698	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Nay,” cried Bingley, “this is too much, to remember at night all the
  1699	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfoolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour,
  1700	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI believe what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this
  1701	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmoment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless
  1702	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tprecipitance merely to show off before the ladies.”
  1703	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1704	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that
  1705	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as
  1706	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were
  1707	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmounting your horse, a friend were to say, ‘Bingley, you had better
  1708	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tstay till next week,’ you would probably do it, you would probably not
  1709	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgo--and at another word, might stay a month.”
  1710	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1711	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You have only proved by this,” cried Elizabeth, “that Mr. Bingley did
  1712	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now much
  1713	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmore than he did himself.”
  1714	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1715	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I am exceedingly gratified,” said Bingley, “by your converting what my
  1716	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfriend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am
  1717	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tafraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means
  1718	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tintend; for he would certainly think better of me, if under such a
  1719	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcircumstance I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I
  1720	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcould.”
  1721	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1722	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intentions
  1723	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?”
  1724	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1725	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must speak for
  1726	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thimself.”
  1727	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1728	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine,
  1729	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbut which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to
  1730	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tstand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet,
  1731	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and
  1732	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering
  1733	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tone argument in favour of its propriety.”
  1734	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1735	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit
  1736	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith you.”
  1737	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1738	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of
  1739	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teither.”
  1740	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1741	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of
  1742	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfriendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make
  1743	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tone readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason
  1744	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tone into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have
  1745	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsupposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the
  1746	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcircumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour
  1747	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthereupon. But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend,
  1748	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhere one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no
  1749	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvery great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying
  1750	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?”
  1751	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1752	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to
  1753	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tarrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to
  1754	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tappertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting
  1755	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbetween the parties?”
  1756	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1757	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“By all means,” cried Bingley; “let us hear all the particulars, not
  1758	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tforgetting their comparative height and size; for that will have more
  1759	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tweight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure
  1760	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou, that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with
  1761	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmyself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not
  1762	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tknow a more awful object than Darcy, on particular occasions, and in
  1763	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tparticular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening,
  1764	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhen he has nothing to do.”
  1765	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1766	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was
  1767	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly
  1768	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tresented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her
  1769	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbrother for talking such nonsense.
  1770	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1771	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I see your design, Bingley,” said his friend. “You dislike an argument,
  1772	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand want to silence this.”
  1773	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1774	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss
  1775	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very
  1776	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.”
  1777	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1778	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“What you ask,” said Elizabeth, “is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.
  1779	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tDarcy had much better finish his letter.”
  1780	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1781	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.
  1782	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1783	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWhen that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth
  1784	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor an indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with some alacrity
  1785	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto the pianoforte; and, after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead
  1786	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she
  1787	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tseated herself.
  1788	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1789	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed,
  1790	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books
  1791	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy’s eyes were fixed
  1792	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ton her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of
  1793	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tadmiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her
  1794	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbecause he disliked her, was still more strange. She could only imagine,
  1795	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thowever, at last that she drew his notice because there was something
  1796	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmore wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in
  1797	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tany other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked
  1798	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim too little to care for his approbation.
  1799	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1800	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAfter playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by
  1801	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near
  1802	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth, said to her:
  1803	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1804	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an
  1805	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\topportunity of dancing a reel?”
  1806	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1807	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some
  1808	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsurprise at her silence.
  1809	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1810	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh!” said she, “I heard you before, but I could not immediately
  1811	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdetermine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say ‘Yes,’
  1812	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always
  1813	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdelight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of
  1814	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttheir premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell
  1815	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou, that I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if
  1816	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou dare.”
  1817	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1818	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Indeed I do not dare.”
  1819	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1820	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his
  1821	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her
  1822	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmanner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody; and Darcy
  1823	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really
  1824	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbelieved, that were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he
  1825	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshould be in some danger.
  1826	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1827	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMiss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her great
  1828	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tanxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some
  1829	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tassistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.
  1830	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1831	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of
  1832	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttheir supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.
  1833	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1834	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I hope,” said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery
  1835	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe next day, “you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this
  1836	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdesirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;
  1837	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand if you can compass it, do cure the younger girls of running after
  1838	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tofficers. And, if I may mention so delicate a subject, endeavour to
  1839	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcheck that little something, bordering on conceit and impertinence,
  1840	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhich your lady possesses.”
  1841	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1842	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?”
  1843	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1844	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh! yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be placed
  1845	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your great-uncle the
  1846	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tjudge. They are in the same profession, you know, only in different
  1847	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlines. As for your Elizabeth’s picture, you must not have it taken, for
  1848	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhat painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes?”
  1849	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1850	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but their
  1851	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcolour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine, might be
  1852	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcopied.”
  1853	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1854	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAt that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and
  1855	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth herself.
  1856	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1857	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I did not know that you intended to walk,” said Miss Bingley, in some
  1858	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconfusion, lest they had been overheard.
  1859	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1860	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You used us abominably ill,” answered Mrs. Hurst, “running away without
  1861	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttelling us that you were coming out.”
  1862	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1863	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThen taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she left Elizabeth to walk
  1864	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tby herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt their rudeness,
  1865	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand immediately said:
  1866	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1867	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go into the
  1868	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tavenue.”
  1869	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1870	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBut Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with them,
  1871	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlaughingly answered:
  1872	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1873	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and appear
  1874	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a
  1875	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfourth. Good-bye.”
  1876	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1877	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of
  1878	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeing at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered
  1879	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening.
  1880	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1881	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1882	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1883	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tChapter 11
  1884	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1885	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1886	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWhen the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her
  1887	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the
  1888	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdrawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends with many
  1889	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tprofessions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable
  1890	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared.
  1891	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tTheir powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe an
  1892	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tentertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh
  1893	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tat their acquaintance with spirit.
  1894	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1895	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBut when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object;
  1896	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMiss Bingley’s eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy, and she had
  1897	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsomething to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed
  1898	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thimself to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also
  1899	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmade her a slight bow, and said he was “very glad;” but diffuseness
  1900	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand warmth remained for Bingley’s salutation. He was full of joy and
  1901	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tattention. The first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she
  1902	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshould suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire
  1903	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto the other side of the fireplace, that she might be further from
  1904	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone
  1905	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\telse. Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great
  1906	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdelight.
  1907	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1908	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWhen tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the
  1909	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcard-table--but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.
  1910	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tDarcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open
  1911	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpetition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and
  1912	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr.
  1913	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHurst had therefore nothing to do, but to stretch himself on one of the
  1914	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same;
  1915	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets
  1916	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand rings, joined now and then in her brother’s conversation with Miss
  1917	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBennet.
  1918	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1919	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMiss Bingley’s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.
  1920	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tDarcy’s progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she
  1921	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She
  1922	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcould not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her
  1923	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tquestion, and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be
  1924	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tamused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the
  1925	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsecond volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, “How pleasant
  1926	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit is to spend an evening in this way! I declare after all there is no
  1927	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tenjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a
  1928	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbook! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not
  1929	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tan excellent library.”
  1930	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1931	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tNo one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and
  1932	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement; when hearing
  1933	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly
  1934	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttowards him and said:
  1935	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1936	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at
  1937	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tNetherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult
  1938	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are
  1939	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a
  1940	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpleasure.”
  1941	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1942	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“If you mean Darcy,” cried her brother, “he may go to bed, if he
  1943	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tchooses, before it begins--but as for the ball, it is quite a settled
  1944	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I shall send
  1945	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tround my cards.”
  1946	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1947	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I should like balls infinitely better,” she replied, “if they were
  1948	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcarried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably
  1949	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much
  1950	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmore rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of
  1951	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe day.”
  1952	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1953	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be
  1954	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnear so much like a ball.”
  1955	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1956	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMiss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and walked
  1957	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tabout the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but
  1958	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tDarcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In
  1959	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more, and,
  1960	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tturning to Elizabeth, said:
  1961	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1962	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a
  1963	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tturn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so
  1964	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlong in one attitude.”
  1965	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1966	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley
  1967	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsucceeded no less in the real object of her civility; Mr. Darcy looked
  1968	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tup. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as
  1969	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was
  1970	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdirectly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that
  1971	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\the could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down
  1972	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe room together, with either of which motives his joining them would
  1973	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinterfere. “What could he mean? She was dying to know what could be his
  1974	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmeaning?”--and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him?
  1975	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1976	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Not at all,” was her answer; “but depend upon it, he means to be severe
  1977	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ton us, and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing
  1978	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tabout it.”
  1979	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1980	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMiss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in
  1981	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tanything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his
  1982	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttwo motives.
  1983	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1984	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,” said he, as soon
  1985	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas she allowed him to speak. “You either choose this method of passing
  1986	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe evening because you are in each other’s confidence, and have secret
  1987	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taffairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures
  1988	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tappear to the greatest advantage in walking; if the first, I would be
  1989	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcompletely in your way, and if the second, I can admire you much better
  1990	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas I sit by the fire.”
  1991	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1992	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh! shocking!” cried Miss Bingley. “I never heard anything so
  1993	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tabominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?”
  1994	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1995	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,” said Elizabeth. “We
  1996	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcan all plague and punish one another. Tease him--laugh at him. Intimate
  1997	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas you are, you must know how it is to be done.”
  1998	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  1999	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“But upon my honour, I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy has
  2000	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot yet taught me _that_. Tease calmness of manner and presence of
  2001	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmind! No, no; I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will
  2002	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a
  2003	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsubject. Mr. Darcy may hug himself.”
  2004	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2005	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!” cried Elizabeth. “That is an
  2006	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tuncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would
  2007	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintances. I dearly love a
  2008	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlaugh.”
  2009	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2010	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Miss Bingley,” said he, “has given me more credit than can be.
  2011	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe wisest and the best of men--nay, the wisest and best of their
  2012	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tactions--may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in
  2013	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlife is a joke.”
  2014	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2015	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Certainly,” replied Elizabeth--“there are such people, but I hope I
  2016	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tam not one of _them_. I hope I never ridicule what is wise and good.
  2017	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tFollies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_ divert me, I own,
  2018	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand I laugh at them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely
  2019	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhat you are without.”
  2020	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2021	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study
  2022	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong
  2023	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunderstanding to ridicule.”
  2024	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2025	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Such as vanity and pride.”
  2026	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2027	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride--where there is a real
  2028	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuperiority of mind, pride will be always under good regulation.”
  2029	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2030	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth turned away to hide a smile.
  2031	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2032	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,” said Miss Bingley;
  2033	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“and pray what is the result?”
  2034	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2035	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it
  2036	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thimself without disguise.”
  2037	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2038	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“No,” said Darcy, “I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough,
  2039	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbut they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch
  2040	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor. It is, I believe, too little yielding--certainly too little for the
  2041	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconvenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of others
  2042	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tso soon as I ought, nor their offenses against myself. My feelings
  2043	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tare not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper
  2044	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twould perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lost
  2045	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tforever.”
  2046	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2047	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“_That_ is a failing indeed!” cried Elizabeth. “Implacable resentment
  2048	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t_is_ a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. I
  2049	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treally cannot _laugh_ at it. You are safe from me.”
  2050	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2051	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular
  2052	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tevil--a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.”
  2053	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2054	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And _your_ defect is to hate everybody.”
  2055	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2056	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And yours,” he replied with a smile, “is willfully to misunderstand
  2057	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthem.”
  2058	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2059	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Do let us have a little music,” cried Miss Bingley, tired of a
  2060	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconversation in which she had no share. “Louisa, you will not mind my
  2061	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twaking Mr. Hurst?”
  2062	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2063	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHer sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was
  2064	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\topened; and Darcy, after a few moments’ recollection, was not sorry for
  2065	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention.

  2071	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2072	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIn consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the
  2073	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnext morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for
  2074	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthem in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on
  2075	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which
  2076	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twould exactly finish Jane’s week, could not bring herself to receive
  2077	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthem with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at
  2078	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tleast not to Elizabeth’s wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs.
  2079	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage
  2080	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbefore Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley
  2081	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them
  2082	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvery well. Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively
  2083	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tresolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the
  2084	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcontrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,
  2085	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley’s carriage immediately, and at
  2086	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlength it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield
  2087	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat morning should be mentioned, and the request made.
  2088	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2089	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was
  2090	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsaid of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work
  2091	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ton Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was
  2092	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthen sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike
  2093	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.
  2094	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2095	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so
  2096	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsoon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be
  2097	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsafe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where
  2098	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe felt herself to be right.
  2099	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2100	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tTo Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence--Elizabeth had been at
  2101	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tNetherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked--and Miss
  2102	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBingley was uncivil to _her_, and more teasing than usual to himself.
  2103	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHe wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration
  2104	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshould _now_ escape him, nothing that could elevate her with the hope
  2105	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof influencing his felicity; sensible that if such an idea had been
  2106	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight
  2107	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke
  2108	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tten words to her through the whole of Saturday, and though they were
  2109	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tat one time left by themselves for half-an-hour, he adhered most
  2110	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.
  2111	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2112	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tOn Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost
  2113	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tall, took place. Miss Bingley’s civility to Elizabeth increased at last
  2114	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvery rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,
  2115	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tafter assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her
  2116	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most
  2117	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttenderly, she even shook hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave of
  2118	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe whole party in the liveliest of spirits.
  2119	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2120	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThey were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet
  2121	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much
  2122	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttrouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again. But their
  2123	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfather, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really
  2124	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tglad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The
  2125	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tevening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of
  2126	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tits animation, and almost all its sense by the absence of Jane and
  2127	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth.
  2128	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2129	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThey found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass and human
  2130	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnature; and had some extracts to admire, and some new observations of
  2131	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthreadbare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had information
  2132	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor them of a different sort. Much had been done and much had been said
  2133	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers
  2134	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad dined lately with their uncle, a private had been flogged, and it
  2135	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.

  2141	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2142	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I hope, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at
  2143	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbreakfast the next morning, “that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,
  2144	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbecause I have reason to expect an addition to our family party.”
  2145	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2146	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am sure,
  2147	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in--and I hope _my_ dinners
  2148	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tare good enough for her. I do not believe she often sees such at home.”
  2149	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2150	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger.”
  2151	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2152	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled. “A gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr.
  2153	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBingley, I am sure! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr.
  2154	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBingley. But--good Lord! how unlucky! There is not a bit of fish to be
  2155	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgot to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell--I must speak to Hill this
  2156	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmoment.”
  2157	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2158	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“It is _not_ Mr. Bingley,” said her husband; “it is a person whom I
  2159	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnever saw in the whole course of my life.”
  2160	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2161	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThis roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being
  2162	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once.
  2163	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2164	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAfter amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained:
  2165	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2166	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“About a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight ago
  2167	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring
  2168	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tearly attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead,
  2169	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmay turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.”
  2170	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2171	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh! my dear,” cried his wife, “I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.
  2172	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tPray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing
  2173	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own
  2174	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tchildren; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago
  2175	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto do something or other about it.”
  2176	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2177	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tJane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail. They
  2178	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on which
  2179	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and she continued to rail
  2180	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of
  2181	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfive daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.
  2182	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2183	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,” said Mr. Bennet, “and
  2184	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.
  2185	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBut if you will listen to his letter, you may perhaps be a little
  2186	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsoftened by his manner of expressing himself.”
  2187	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2188	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very impertinent of
  2189	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim to write to you at all, and very hypocritical. I hate such false
  2190	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfriends. Why could he not keep on quarreling with you, as his father did
  2191	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbefore him?”
  2192	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2193	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Why, indeed; he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that
  2194	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thead, as you will hear.”
  2195	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2196	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15th October.

  2200	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured
  2201	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfather always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have had the
  2202	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmisfortune to lose him, I have frequently wished to heal the breach; but
  2203	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor some time I was kept back by my own doubts, fearing lest it might
  2204	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tseem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone
  2205	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith whom it had always pleased him to be at variance.--‘There, Mrs.
  2206	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBennet.’--My mind, however, is now made up on the subject, for having
  2207	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treceived ordination at Easter, I have been so fortunate as to be
  2208	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdistinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de
  2209	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBourgh, widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has
  2210	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpreferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be
  2211	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmy earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her
  2212	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which
  2213	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tare instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman, moreover, I
  2214	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfeel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in
  2215	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tall families within the reach of my influence; and on these grounds I
  2216	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tflatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable, and
  2217	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate
  2218	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twill be kindly overlooked on your side, and not lead you to reject the
  2219	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\toffered olive-branch. I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the
  2220	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmeans of injuring your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for
  2221	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit, as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible
  2222	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tamends--but of this hereafter. If you should have no objection to
  2223	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treceive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting

  2225	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday se’ennight

  2235	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. “He seems to be a most
  2236	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconscientious and polite young man, upon my word, and I doubt not will
  2237	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tprove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so
  2238	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tindulgent as to let him come to us again.”
  2239	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2240	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however, and if
  2241	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\the is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the person to
  2242	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdiscourage him.”
  2243	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2244	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Though it is difficult,” said Jane, “to guess in what way he can mean
  2245	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his
  2246	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcredit.”
  2247	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2248	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth was chiefly struck by his extraordinary deference for Lady

  2256	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2257	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“No, my dear, I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite the

  2259	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tletter, which promises well. I am impatient to see him.”

  2261	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“In point of composition,” said Mary, “the letter does not seem
  2262	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdefective. The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly new, yet I
  2263	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthink it is well expressed.”
  2264	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2265	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tTo Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in any
  2266	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdegree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should
  2267	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcome in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had
  2268	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treceived pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for
  2269	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttheir mother, Mr. Collins’s letter had done away much of her ill-will,
  2270	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which
  2271	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tastonished her husband and daughters.
  2272	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2273	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great
  2274	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpoliteness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the
  2275	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in
  2276	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tneed of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a
  2277	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttall, heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. His air was grave and
  2278	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tstately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated
  2279	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbefore he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of
  2280	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdaughters; said he had heard much of their beauty, but that in this
  2281	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinstance fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did
  2282	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage. This
  2283	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs.
  2284	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBennet, who quarreled with no compliments, answered most readily.
  2285	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2286	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may
  2287	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tprove so, for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so
  2288	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\toddly.”
  2289	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2290	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.”
  2291	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2292	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you
  2293	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmust confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things
  2294	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI know are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates
  2295	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twill go when once they come to be entailed.”
  2296	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2297	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and
  2298	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcould say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing
  2299	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tforward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come
  2300	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tprepared to admire them. At present I will not say more; but, perhaps,
  2301	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhen we are better acquainted--”
  2302	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2303	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHe was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each
  2304	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tother. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins’s admiration. The
  2305	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised;
  2306	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet’s
  2307	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\theart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his
  2308	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\town future property. The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and
  2309	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\the begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its
  2310	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcooking was owing. But he was set right there by Mrs. Bennet, who
  2311	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tassured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a
  2312	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgood cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He
  2313	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbegged pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared
  2314	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\therself not at all offended; but he continued to apologise for about a
  2315	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tquarter of an hour.

  2320	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2321	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2322	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tDuring dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants
  2323	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twere withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his
  2324	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tguest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to
  2325	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady
  2326	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCatherine de Bourgh’s attention to his wishes, and consideration for
  2327	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen
  2328	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbetter. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him
  2329	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto more than usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect
  2330	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\the protested that “he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in
  2331	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself
  2332	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texperienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to
  2333	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tapprove of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of
  2334	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpreaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,
  2335	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of
  2336	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tquadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many
  2337	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpeople he knew, but _he_ had never seen anything but affability in her.
  2338	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she
  2339	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmade not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the
  2340	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tneighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or
  2341	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttwo, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to
  2342	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmarry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had
  2343	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tonce paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly
  2344	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tapproved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed
  2345	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto suggest some herself--some shelves in the closet up stairs.”
  2346	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2347	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,” said Mrs. Bennet, “and
  2348	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies
  2349	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?”
  2350	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2351	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane
  2352	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfrom Rosings Park, her ladyship’s residence.”
  2353	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2354	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I think you said she was a widow, sir? Has she any family?”
  2355	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2356	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“She has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very
  2357	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\textensive property.”
  2358	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2359	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Ah!” said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, “then she is better off than
  2360	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmany girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she handsome?”
  2361	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2362	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“She is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself says
  2363	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the
  2364	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thandsomest of her sex, because there is that in her features which marks
  2365	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe young lady of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly
  2366	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconstitution, which has prevented her from making that progress in many
  2367	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taccomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of, as I am
  2368	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinformed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still
  2369	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tresides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends
  2370	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.”
  2371	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2372	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at
  2373	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcourt.”
  2374	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2375	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;
  2376	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has deprived the
  2377	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBritish court of its brightest ornament. Her ladyship seemed pleased
  2378	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to
  2379	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\toffer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable
  2380	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto ladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that
  2381	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most
  2382	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\televated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by
  2383	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther. These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship, and
  2384	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to
  2385	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpay.”
  2386	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2387	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You judge very properly,” said Mr. Bennet, “and it is happy for you
  2388	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask
  2389	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the
  2390	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmoment, or are the result of previous study?”
  2391	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2392	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though I
  2393	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant
  2394	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcompliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to
  2395	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgive them as unstudied an air as possible.”
  2396	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2397	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Bennet’s expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd
  2398	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas he had hoped, and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,
  2399	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmaintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,
  2400	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner
  2401	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin his pleasure.
  2402	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2403	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBy tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet was glad
  2404	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto take his guest into the drawing-room again, and, when tea was over,
  2405	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tglad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies. Mr. Collins readily
  2406	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tassented, and a book was produced; but, on beholding it (for everything
  2407	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tannounced it to be from a circulating library), he started back, and
  2408	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbegging pardon, protested that he never read novels. Kitty stared at
  2409	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim, and Lydia exclaimed. Other books were produced, and after some
  2410	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdeliberation he chose Fordyce’s Sermons. Lydia gaped as he opened the
  2411	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvolume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three
  2412	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpages, she interrupted him with:
  2413	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2414	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning away
  2415	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tRichard; and if he does, Colonel Forster will hire him. My aunt told me
  2416	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tso herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more
  2417	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tabout it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town.”
  2418	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2419	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.
  2420	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCollins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said:
  2421	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2422	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books
  2423	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes
  2424	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tme, I confess; for, certainly, there can be nothing so advantageous to
  2425	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthem as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin.”
  2426	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2427	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThen turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at
  2428	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbackgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted
  2429	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvery wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements.
  2430	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia’s
  2431	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinterruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would
  2432	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tresume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his
  2433	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyoung cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any
  2434	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taffront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared
  2435	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor backgammon.

  2439	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tChapter 15
  2440	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2441	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2442	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had
  2443	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeen but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part
  2444	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and
  2445	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmiserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he
  2446	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful
  2447	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tacquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up had
  2448	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgiven him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a
  2449	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgood deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in
  2450	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tretirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected
  2451	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tprosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de
  2452	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which
  2453	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\the felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,
  2454	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a
  2455	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tclergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of
  2456	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.
  2457	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2458	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHaving now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to
  2459	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmarry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had
  2460	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found
  2461	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthem as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.
  2462	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThis was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father’s
  2463	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\testate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and
  2464	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own
  2465	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpart.
  2466	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2467	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHis plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet’s lovely face
  2468	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconfirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what
  2469	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled
  2470	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tchoice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a
  2471	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tquarter of an hour’s tete-a-tete with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a
  2472	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally
  2473	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress might be found for it at
  2474	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLongbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general
  2475	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tencouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. “As to
  2476	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther _younger_ daughters, she could not take upon her to say--she could
  2477	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession; her
  2478	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t_eldest_ daughter, she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her
  2479	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.”
  2480	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2481	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon
  2482	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdone--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally
  2483	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnext to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.
  2484	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2485	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have
  2486	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttwo daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of
  2487	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe day before was now high in her good graces.
  2488	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2489	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLydia’s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister
  2490	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texcept Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them,
  2491	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tat the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,
  2492	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed
  2493	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim after breakfast; and there he would continue, nominally engaged with
  2494	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tone of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.
  2495	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such
  2496	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdoings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been
  2497	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\talways sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told
  2498	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the
  2499	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thouse, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore,
  2500	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their
  2501	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twalk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker
  2502	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthan a reader, was extremely pleased to close his large book, and go.
  2503	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2504	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIn pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his
  2505	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of
  2506	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him. Their eyes were
  2507	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timmediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers, and
  2508	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed, or a really new muslin in
  2509	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta shop window, could recall them.
  2510	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2511	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBut the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom
  2512	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthey had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking
  2513	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith another officer on the other side of the way. The officer was
  2514	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe very Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came
  2515	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto inquire, and he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the
  2516	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tstranger’s air, all wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia,
  2517	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdetermined if possible to find out, led the way across the street, under
  2518	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpretense of wanting something in an opposite shop, and fortunately
  2519	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had
  2520	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treached the same spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated
  2521	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpermission to introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with
  2522	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim the day before from town, and he was happy to say had accepted a
  2523	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcommission in their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the
  2524	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyoung man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming.
  2525	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHis appearance was greatly in his favour; he had all the best part of
  2526	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeauty, a fine countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address.
  2527	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness
  2528	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof conversation--a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and
  2529	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunassuming; and the whole party were still standing and talking together
  2530	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvery agreeably, when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy
  2531	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand Bingley were seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the
  2532	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and
  2533	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbegan the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and
  2534	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMiss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on his way to
  2535	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLongbourn on purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated
  2536	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes
  2537	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ton Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the
  2538	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tstranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they
  2539	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlooked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting.
  2540	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBoth changed colour, one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham,
  2541	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tafter a few moments, touched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just
  2542	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdeigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to
  2543	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timagine; it was impossible not to long to know.
  2544	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2545	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIn another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what
  2546	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpassed, took leave and rode on with his friend.
  2547	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2548	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of
  2549	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Phillip’s house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia’s
  2550	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpressing entreaties that they should come in, and even in spite of
  2551	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Phillips’s throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the
  2552	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinvitation.
  2553	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2554	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest,
  2555	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfrom their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was
  2556	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as
  2557	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttheir own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing
  2558	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tabout, if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones’s shop-boy in the
  2559	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tstreet, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to
  2560	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tNetherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility
  2561	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane’s introduction of him. She
  2562	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treceived him with her very best politeness, which he returned with
  2563	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas much more, apologising for his intrusion, without any previous
  2564	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tacquaintance with her, which he could not help flattering himself,
  2565	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thowever, might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who
  2566	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tintroduced him to her notice. Mrs. Phillips was quite awed by such an
  2567	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texcess of good breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon
  2568	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tput to an end by exclamations and inquiries about the other; of whom,
  2569	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thowever, she could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that
  2570	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Denny had brought him from London, and that he was to have a
  2571	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlieutenant’s commission in the ----shire. She had been watching him the
  2572	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlast hour, she said, as he walked up and down the street, and had Mr.
  2573	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the
  2574	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\toccupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of the
  2575	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tofficers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become “stupid,
  2576	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdisagreeable fellows.” Some of them were to dine with the Phillipses
  2577	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.
  2578	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn
  2579	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twould come in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Phillips
  2580	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tprotested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery
  2581	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such
  2582	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdelights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.
  2583	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCollins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured
  2584	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless.
  2585	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2586	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAs they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass
  2587	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbetween the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either
  2588	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tor both, had they appeared to be in the wrong, she could no more explain
  2589	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuch behaviour than her sister.
  2590	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2591	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring
  2592	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Phillips’s manners and politeness. He protested that, except Lady
  2593	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCatherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman;
  2594	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but even
  2595	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although
  2596	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tutterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be
  2597	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tattributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so
  2598	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmuch attention in the whole course of his life.
  2599	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t

  2602	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tChapter 16
  2603	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2604	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2605	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAs no objection was made to the young people’s engagement with their
  2606	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taunt, and all Mr. Collins’s scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for
  2607	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach
  2608	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and
  2609	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room,
  2610	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle’s invitation, and was then in
  2611	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe house.
  2612	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2613	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWhen this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr.
  2614	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCollins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much
  2615	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tstruck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he
  2616	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmight almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast
  2617	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tparlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much
  2618	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgratification; but when Mrs. Phillips understood from him what
  2619	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tRosings was, and who was its proprietor--when she had listened to the
  2620	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdescription of only one of Lady Catherine’s drawing-rooms, and found
  2621	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all
  2622	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison
  2623	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith the housekeeper’s room.
  2624	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2625	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIn describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion,
  2626	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and
  2627	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the
  2628	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Phillips a very attentive
  2629	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlistener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she
  2630	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\theard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as
  2631	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsoon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin,
  2632	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine
  2633	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttheir own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the
  2634	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinterval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last, however.
  2635	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe gentlemen did approach, and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room,
  2636	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking
  2637	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration.
  2638	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe officers of the ----shire were in general a very creditable,
  2639	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgentlemanlike set, and the best of them were of the present party; but
  2640	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and
  2641	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twalk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips,
  2642	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbreathing port wine, who followed them into the room.
  2643	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2644	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was
  2645	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tturned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated
  2646	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thimself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into
  2647	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, made her feel
  2648	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered
  2649	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinteresting by the skill of the speaker.
  2650	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2651	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWith such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the
  2652	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tofficers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young
  2653	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind
  2654	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlistener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her watchfulness, most abundantly
  2655	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsupplied with coffee and muffin. When the card-tables were placed, he
  2656	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad the opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist.
  2657	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2658	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I know little of the game at present,” said he, “but I shall be glad
  2659	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto improve myself, for in my situation in life--” Mrs. Phillips was very
  2660	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tglad for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.
  2661	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2662	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he
  2663	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treceived at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there
  2664	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tseemed danger of Lydia’s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most
  2665	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdetermined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,
  2666	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets
  2667	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular.
  2668	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAllowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore
  2669	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tat leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear
  2670	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be
  2671	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttold--the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not
  2672	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teven mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly
  2673	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trelieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far
  2674	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tNetherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in
  2675	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.
  2676	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2677	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“About a month,” said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject
  2678	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdrop, added, “He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I
  2679	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunderstand.”
  2680	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2681	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes,” replied Mr. Wickham; “his estate there is a noble one. A clear
  2682	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tten thousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more
  2683	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcapable of giving you certain information on that head than myself, for
  2684	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my
  2685	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinfancy.”
  2686	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2687	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth could not but look surprised.
  2688	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2689	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after
  2690	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tseeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting
  2691	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?”
  2692	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2693	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“As much as I ever wish to be,” cried Elizabeth very warmly. “I have
  2694	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tspent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very
  2695	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdisagreeable.”
  2696	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2697	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I have no right to give _my_ opinion,” said Wickham, “as to his being
  2698	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tagreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him
  2699	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttoo long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_
  2700	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general
  2701	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tastonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly
  2702	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tanywhere else. Here you are in your own family.”
  2703	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2704	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Upon my word, I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in
  2705	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in
  2706	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find
  2707	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim more favourably spoken of by anyone.”
  2708	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2709	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I cannot pretend to be sorry,” said Wickham, after a short
  2710	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinterruption, “that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond
  2711	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttheir deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen. The
  2712	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tworld is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his
  2713	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thigh and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.”
  2714	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2715	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an
  2716	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\till-tempered man.” Wickham only shook his head.
  2717	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2718	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I wonder,” said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, “whether he is
  2719	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlikely to be in this country much longer.”
  2720	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2721	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I
  2722	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will
  2723	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.”
  2724	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2725	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh! no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If _he_
  2726	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twishes to avoid seeing _me_, he must go. We are not on friendly terms,
  2727	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for
  2728	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tavoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim before all the world, a sense
  2729	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof very great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he
  2730	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tis. His father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men
  2731	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never
  2732	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe in company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by
  2733	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta thousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been
  2734	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tscandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and
  2735	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teverything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the
  2736	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmemory of his father.”
  2737	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2738	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with
  2739	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tall her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.
  2740	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2741	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the
  2742	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tneighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that
  2743	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\the had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but very
  2744	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tintelligible gallantry.
  2745	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2746	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,” he added,
  2747	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. I knew it to be
  2748	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me
  2749	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfurther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great
  2750	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tattentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had procured them.
  2751	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tSociety, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and
  2752	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmy spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society.
  2753	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tA military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have
  2754	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnow made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I
  2755	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in
  2756	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpossession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we
  2757	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twere speaking of just now.”
  2758	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2759	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Indeed!”
  2760	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2761	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best
  2762	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tliving in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.
  2763	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply,
  2764	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given
  2765	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\telsewhere.”
  2766	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2767	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Good heavens!” cried Elizabeth; “but how could _that_ be? How could his
  2768	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twill be disregarded? Why did you not seek legal redress?”
  2769	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2770	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to
  2771	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgive me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the
  2772	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tintention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely
  2773	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim
  2774	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto it by extravagance, imprudence--in short anything or nothing. Certain
  2775	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit is, that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was
  2776	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no
  2777	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tless certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done
  2778	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tanything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper, and
  2779	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI may have spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too freely. I can
  2780	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trecall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very different sort
  2781	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof men, and that he hates me.”
  2782	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2783	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced.”
  2784	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2785	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_. Till I
  2786	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcan forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.”
  2787	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2788	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than
  2789	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tever as he expressed them.
  2790	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2791	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“But what,” said she, after a pause, “can have been his motive? What can
  2792	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thave induced him to behave so cruelly?”
  2793	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2794	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but
  2795	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tattribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me
  2796	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tless, his son might have borne with me better; but his father’s uncommon
  2797	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tattachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had
  2798	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort
  2799	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof preference which was often given me.”
  2800	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2801	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked
  2802	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim. I had not thought so very ill of him. I had supposed him to be
  2803	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdespising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of
  2804	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdescending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as
  2805	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthis.”
  2806	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2807	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAfter a few minutes’ reflection, however, she continued, “I _do_
  2808	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tremember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of
  2809	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition
  2810	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmust be dreadful.”
  2811	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2812	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I will not trust myself on the subject,” replied Wickham; “I can hardly
  2813	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe just to him.”
  2814	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2815	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, “To
  2816	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttreat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his
  2817	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfather!” She could have added, “A young man, too, like _you_, whose very
  2818	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcountenance may vouch for your being amiable”--but she contented herself
  2819	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith, “and one, too, who had probably been his companion from childhood,
  2820	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconnected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!”
  2821	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2822	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest
  2823	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpart of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house,
  2824	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _My_
  2825	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfather began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Phillips,
  2826	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tappears to do so much credit to--but he gave up everything to be of
  2827	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tuse to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the
  2828	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tPemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most
  2829	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tintimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to
  2830	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe under the greatest obligations to my father’s active superintendence,
  2831	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand when, immediately before my father’s death, Mr. Darcy gave him a
  2832	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvoluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to
  2833	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of his affection to myself.”
  2834	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2835	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“How strange!” cried Elizabeth. “How abominable! I wonder that the very
  2836	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you! If from no better
  2837	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmotive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest--for
  2838	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdishonesty I must call it.”
  2839	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2840	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“It _is_ wonderful,” replied Wickham, “for almost all his actions may
  2841	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend. It has
  2842	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconnected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling. But we are
  2843	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnone of us consistent, and in his behaviour to me there were stronger
  2844	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timpulses even than pride.”
  2845	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2846	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?”
  2847	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2848	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes. It has often led him to be liberal and generous, to give his money
  2849	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfreely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the
  2850	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpoor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride--for he is very proud of what
  2851	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this father was--have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family,
  2852	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the
  2853	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tPemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride,
  2854	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhich, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and
  2855	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcareful guardian of his sister, and you will hear him generally cried up
  2856	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas the most attentive and best of brothers.”
  2857	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2858	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?”
  2859	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2860	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHe shook his head. “I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to
  2861	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tspeak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her brother--very, very
  2862	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tproud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond
  2863	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is
  2864	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,
  2865	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father’s death, her
  2866	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thome has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her
  2867	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teducation.”
  2868	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2869	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAfter many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not
  2870	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thelp reverting once more to the first, and saying:
  2871	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2872	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley,
  2873	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twho seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,
  2874	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you
  2875	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tknow Mr. Bingley?”
  2876	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2877	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Not at all.”
  2878	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2879	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr.
  2880	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tDarcy is.”
  2881	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2882	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not
  2883	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twant abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth
  2884	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is
  2885	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His
  2886	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpride never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just,
  2887	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable--allowing something
  2888	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor fortune and figure.”
  2889	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2890	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round
  2891	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe other table and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin
  2892	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth and Mrs. Phillips. The usual inquiries as to his success were
  2893	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmade by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every
  2894	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpoint; but when Mrs. Phillips began to express her concern thereupon,
  2895	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\the assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least
  2896	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timportance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged
  2897	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat she would not make herself uneasy.
  2898	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2899	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I know very well, madam,” said he, “that when persons sit down to a
  2900	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcard-table, they must take their chances of these things, and happily I
  2901	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tam not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There
  2902	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tare undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady
  2903	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCatherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding
  2904	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlittle matters.”
  2905	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2906	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Wickham’s attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for
  2907	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation
  2908	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh.
  2909	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2910	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Lady Catherine de Bourgh,” she replied, “has very lately given him
  2911	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her
  2912	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnotice, but he certainly has not known her long.”
  2913	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2914	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy
  2915	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twere sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.”
  2916	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2917	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine’s
  2918	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconnections. I never heard of her existence till the day before
  2919	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyesterday.”
  2920	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2921	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is
  2922	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbelieved that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.”
  2923	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2924	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThis information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss
  2925	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her
  2926	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taffection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already
  2927	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tself-destined for another.
  2928	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2929	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Mr. Collins,” said she, “speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her
  2930	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdaughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship,
  2931	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his
  2932	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpatroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.”
  2933	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2934	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I believe her to be both in a great degree,” replied Wickham; “I have
  2935	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked
  2936	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the
  2937	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe
  2938	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from
  2939	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for her
  2940	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an
  2941	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunderstanding of the first class.”
  2942	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2943	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and
  2944	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthey continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till supper
  2945	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tput an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.
  2946	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWickham’s attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise
  2947	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof Mrs. Phillips’s supper party, but his manners recommended him to
  2948	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teverybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done
  2949	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could
  2950	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthink of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all
  2951	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name
  2952	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia
  2953	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttalked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the
  2954	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfish she had won; and Mr. Collins in describing the civility of Mr. and
  2955	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Phillips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses
  2956	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tat whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing
  2957	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage
  2958	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbefore the carriage stopped at Longbourn House.
  2959	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t

  2963	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2964	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2965	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between Mr.
  2966	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and concern; she
  2967	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tknew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.
  2968	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBingley’s regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the
  2969	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tveracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. The
  2970	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpossibility of his having endured such unkindness, was enough to
  2971	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinterest all her tender feelings; and nothing remained therefore to be
  2972	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdone, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each,
  2973	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be
  2974	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\totherwise explained.
  2975	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2976	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“They have both,” said she, “been deceived, I dare say, in some way
  2977	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tor other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps
  2978	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmisrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to
  2979	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them,
  2980	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twithout actual blame on either side.”
  2981	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2982	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say on
  2983	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbehalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the
  2984	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbusiness? Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of
  2985	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsomebody.”
  2986	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2987	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my
  2988	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\topinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light
  2989	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father’s favourite in such
  2990	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta manner, one whom his father had promised to provide for. It is
  2991	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timpossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his
  2992	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcharacter, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so
  2993	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texcessively deceived in him? Oh! no.”
  2994	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  2995	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley’s being imposed on, than
  2996	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me
  2997	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlast night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If it
  2998	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his
  2999	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlooks.”
  3000	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3001	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“It is difficult indeed--it is distressing. One does not know what to
  3002	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthink.”
  3003	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3004	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think.”
  3005	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3006	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBut Jane could think with certainty on only one point--that Mr. Bingley,
  3007	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tif he _had_ been imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair
  3008	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbecame public.
  3009	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3010	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this
  3011	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had
  3012	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeen speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal
  3013	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinvitation for the long-expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed
  3014	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see their
  3015	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly
  3016	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tasked what she had been doing with herself since their separation. To
  3017	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet
  3018	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to
  3019	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe others. They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an
  3020	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tactivity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if
  3021	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teager to escape from Mrs. Bennet’s civilities.
  3022	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3023	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every
  3024	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfemale of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in
  3025	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcompliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered
  3026	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tby receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a
  3027	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the
  3028	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsociety of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and
  3029	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.
  3030	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy’s look
  3031	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended
  3032	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tless on any single event, or any particular person, for though they
  3033	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teach, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham,
  3034	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\the was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball
  3035	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family that she
  3036	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad no disinclination for it.
  3037	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3038	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“While I can have my mornings to myself,” said she, “it is enough--I
  3039	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthink it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.
  3040	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tSociety has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those
  3041	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twho consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for
  3042	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teverybody.”
  3043	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3044	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth’s spirits were so high on this occasion, that though she did
  3045	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking
  3046	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley’s invitation, and if
  3047	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\the did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening’s
  3048	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tamusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no
  3049	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tscruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke
  3050	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teither from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to
  3051	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdance.
  3052	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3053	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you,” said he, “that a ball
  3054	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people,
  3055	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcan have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing
  3056	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmyself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair
  3057	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of
  3058	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsoliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially,
  3059	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right
  3060	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcause, and not to any disrespect for her.”
  3061	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3062	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being
  3063	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tengaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins
  3064	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinstead! her liveliness had never been worse timed. There was no help
  3065	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor it, however. Mr. Wickham’s happiness and her own were perforce
  3066	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdelayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins’s proposal accepted with as
  3067	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgood a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his
  3068	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgallantry from the idea it suggested of something more. It now first
  3069	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tstruck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy
  3070	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a
  3071	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tquadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.
  3072	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing
  3073	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcivilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a
  3074	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcompliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than
  3075	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before
  3076	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage
  3077	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas extremely agreeable to _her_. Elizabeth, however, did not choose
  3078	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the
  3079	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconsequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and
  3080	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttill he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.
  3081	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3082	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIf there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the
  3083	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyounger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this
  3084	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttime, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there
  3085	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton
  3086	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tonce. No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after--the very
  3087	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have
  3088	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfound some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the
  3089	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timprovement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than
  3090	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and
  3091	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMonday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.
  3092	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3093	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3094	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3095	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tChapter 18
  3096	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3097	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3098	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tTill Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in
  3099	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a
  3100	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdoubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty
  3101	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that
  3102	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmight not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than
  3103	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tusual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all
  3104	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than
  3105	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmight be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose
  3106	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy’s
  3107	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpleasure in the Bingleys’ invitation to the officers; and though
  3108	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthis was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was
  3109	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpronounced by his friend Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who
  3110	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttold them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the
  3111	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tday before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile,
  3112	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if
  3113	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\the had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here.”
  3114	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3115	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThis part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by
  3116	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for
  3117	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWickham’s absence than if her first surmise had been just, every
  3118	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfeeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate
  3119	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdisappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to
  3120	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.
  3121	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAttendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She
  3122	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away
  3123	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in
  3124	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tspeaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.
  3125	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3126	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBut Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect
  3127	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her
  3128	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tspirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had
  3129	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition
  3130	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular
  3131	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnotice. The first two dances, however, brought a return of distress;
  3132	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthey were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,
  3133	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tapologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being
  3134	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable
  3135	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpartner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from
  3136	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim was ecstasy.
  3137	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3138	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of
  3139	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances
  3140	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twere over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with
  3141	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took
  3142	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that,
  3143	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twithout knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again
  3144	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timmediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of
  3145	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmind; Charlotte tried to console her:
  3146	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3147	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I dare say you will find him very agreeable.”
  3148	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3149	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Heaven forbid! _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find
  3150	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such an
  3151	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tevil.”
  3152	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3153	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWhen the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her
  3154	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper, not to be a
  3155	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsimpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant
  3156	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin the eyes of a man ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no
  3157	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tanswer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which
  3158	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and
  3159	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treading in her neighbours’ looks, their equal amazement in beholding
  3160	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit. They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to
  3161	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at
  3162	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfirst was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would
  3163	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made
  3164	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsome slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again
  3165	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsilent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time
  3166	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith:--“It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. I talked
  3167	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tabout the dance, and _you_ ought to make some sort of remark on the size
  3168	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof the room, or the number of couples.”
  3169	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3170	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHe smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be
  3171	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsaid.
  3172	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3173	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Very well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by I may
  3174	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tobserve that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. But
  3175	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t_now_ we may be silent.”
  3176	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3177	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?”
  3178	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3179	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be
  3180	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tentirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the advantage of
  3181	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged, as that they may have the
  3182	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttrouble of saying as little as possible.”
  3183	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3184	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you
  3185	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timagine that you are gratifying mine?”
  3186	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3187	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Both,” replied Elizabeth archly; “for I have always seen a great
  3188	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsimilarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,
  3189	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttaciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say
  3190	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsomething that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to
  3191	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tposterity with all the eclat of a proverb.”
  3192	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3193	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,”
  3194	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t said he. “How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say. _You_
  3195	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthink it a faithful portrait undoubtedly.”
  3196	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3197	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I must not decide on my own performance.”
  3198	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3199	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHe made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down
  3200	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often
  3201	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twalk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist
  3202	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe temptation, added, “When you met us there the other day, we had just
  3203	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeen forming a new acquaintance.”
  3204	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3205	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his
  3206	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfeatures, but he said not a word, and Elizabeth, though blaming herself
  3207	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a
  3208	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconstrained manner said, “Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners
  3209	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas may ensure his _making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of
  3210	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t_retaining_ them, is less certain.”
  3211	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3212	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship,” replied Elizabeth
  3213	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith emphasis, “and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all
  3214	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this life.”
  3215	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3216	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tDarcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At
  3217	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass
  3218	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthrough the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr.
  3219	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tDarcy, he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on
  3220	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this dancing and his partner.
  3221	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3222	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. Such very
  3223	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuperior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the
  3224	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfirst circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not
  3225	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdisgrace you, and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,
  3226	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tespecially when a certain desirable event, my dear Eliza (glancing at
  3227	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther sister and Bingley) shall take place. What congratulations will then
  3228	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tflow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy:--but let me not interrupt you, sir. You
  3229	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twill not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that
  3230	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyoung lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.”
  3231	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3232	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir
  3233	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWilliam’s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his
  3234	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and
  3235	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tJane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,
  3236	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\the turned to his partner, and said, “Sir William’s interruption has made
  3237	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tme forget what we were talking of.”
  3238	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3239	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have
  3240	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinterrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.
  3241	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWe have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we
  3242	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tare to talk of next I cannot imagine.”
  3243	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3244	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“What think you of books?” said he, smiling.
  3245	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3246	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Books--oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same
  3247	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfeelings.”
  3248	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3249	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be
  3250	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tno want of subject. We may compare our different opinions.”
  3251	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3252	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of
  3253	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsomething else.”
  3254	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3255	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?” said he,
  3256	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith a look of doubt.
  3257	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3258	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes, always,” she replied, without knowing what she said, for her
  3259	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared
  3260	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tby her suddenly exclaiming, “I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,
  3261	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat you hardly ever forgave, that your resentment once created was
  3262	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being
  3263	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcreated_.”
  3264	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3265	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I am,” said he, with a firm voice.
  3266	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3267	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?”
  3268	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3269	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I hope not.”
  3270	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3271	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,
  3272	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto be secure of judging properly at first.”
  3273	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3274	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“May I ask to what these questions tend?”
  3275	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3276	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Merely to the illustration of _your_ character,” said she, endeavouring
  3277	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto shake off her gravity. “I am trying to make it out.”
  3278	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3279	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And what is your success?”
  3280	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3281	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe shook her head. “I do not get on at all. I hear such different
  3282	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taccounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.”
  3283	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3284	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I can readily believe,” answered he gravely, “that reports may vary
  3285	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgreatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were
  3286	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to
  3287	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.”
  3288	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3289	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another
  3290	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\topportunity.”
  3291	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3292	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,” he coldly replied.
  3293	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in
  3294	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsilence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree,
  3295	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor in Darcy’s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards
  3296	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against
  3297	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tanother.
  3298	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3299	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThey had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her, and
  3300	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith an expression of civil disdain accosted her:
  3301	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3302	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham!
  3303	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tYour sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand
  3304	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tquestions; and I find that the young man quite forgot to tell you, among
  3305	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this other communication, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late
  3306	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Darcy’s steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to
  3307	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgive implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy’s
  3308	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tusing him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has
  3309	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\talways been remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated
  3310	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but
  3311	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he
  3312	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother
  3313	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to
  3314	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself
  3315	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tout of the way. His coming into the country at all is a most insolent
  3316	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthing, indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you,
  3317	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMiss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite’s guilt; but really,
  3318	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconsidering his descent, one could not expect much better.”
  3319	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3320	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same,” said
  3321	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth angrily; “for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse
  3322	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthan of being the son of Mr. Darcy’s steward, and of _that_, I can
  3323	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tassure you, he informed me himself.”
  3324	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3325	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I beg your pardon,” replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.
  3326	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Excuse my interference--it was kindly meant.”
  3327	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3328	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Insolent girl!” said Elizabeth to herself. “You are much mistaken
  3329	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tif you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see
  3330	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.
  3331	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tDarcy.” She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make
  3332	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of
  3333	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuch sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently
  3334	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmarked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.
  3335	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for
  3336	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave way
  3337	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbefore the hope of Jane’s being in the fairest way for happiness.
  3338	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3339	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I want to know,” said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her
  3340	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsister’s, “what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have
  3341	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeen too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case
  3342	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou may be sure of my pardon.”
  3343	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3344	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“No,” replied Jane, “I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing
  3345	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsatisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of
  3346	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have
  3347	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tprincipally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,
  3348	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that
  3349	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has
  3350	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treceived; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister’s,
  3351	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has
  3352	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeen very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy’s regard.”
  3353	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3354	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?”
  3355	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3356	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.”
  3357	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3358	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am
  3359	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsatisfied. But what does he say of the living?”
  3360	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3361	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard
  3362	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthem from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to
  3363	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim _conditionally_ only.”
  3364	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3365	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley’s sincerity,” said Elizabeth warmly;
  3366	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.
  3367	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBingley’s defense of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but
  3368	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsince he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt
  3369	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think of
  3370	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tboth gentlemen as I did before.”
  3371	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3372	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on
  3373	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhich there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with
  3374	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdelight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr.
  3375	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBingley’s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence
  3376	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew
  3377	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last
  3378	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpartner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,
  3379	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as
  3380	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto make a most important discovery.
  3381	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3382	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I have found out,” said he, “by a singular accident, that there is now
  3383	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the
  3384	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of
  3385	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady
  3386	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCatherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have
  3387	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de
  3388	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made
  3389	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to
  3390	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdo, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total
  3391	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tignorance of the connection must plead my apology.”
  3392	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3393	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!”
  3394	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3395	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.
  3396	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI believe him to be Lady Catherine’s _nephew_. It will be in my power to
  3397	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tassure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se’nnight.”
  3398	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3399	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring him
  3400	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction
  3401	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that
  3402	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either
  3403	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tside; and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in
  3404	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconsequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her
  3405	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith the determined air of following his own inclination, and, when she
  3406	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tceased speaking, replied thus:
  3407	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3408	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world in
  3409	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyour excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your
  3410	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunderstanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a wide
  3411	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdifference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity,
  3412	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand those which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that
  3413	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with
  3414	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe highest rank in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of
  3415	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbehaviour is at the same time maintained. You must therefore allow me to
  3416	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfollow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to
  3417	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tperform what I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to
  3418	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tprofit by your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant
  3419	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tguide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by
  3420	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teducation and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young
  3421	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlady like yourself.” And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr.
  3422	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tDarcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose
  3423	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tastonishment at being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced
  3424	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of
  3425	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit, she felt as if hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the
  3426	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twords “apology,” “Hunsford,” and “Lady Catherine de Bourgh.” It vexed
  3427	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther to see him expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him
  3428	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him time
  3429	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however,
  3430	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas not discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy’s contempt seemed
  3431	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tabundantly increasing with the length of his second speech, and at the
  3432	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tend of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way. Mr.
  3433	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCollins then returned to Elizabeth.
  3434	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3435	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I have no reason, I assure you,” said he, “to be dissatisfied with my
  3436	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered
  3437	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tme with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying
  3438	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine’s discernment as to be
  3439	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcertain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very
  3440	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thandsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.”
  3441	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3442	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAs Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned
  3443	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the
  3444	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttrain of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to,
  3445	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmade her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in
  3446	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection
  3447	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcould bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of
  3448	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tendeavouring even to like Bingley’s two sisters. Her mother’s thoughts
  3449	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to
  3450	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tventure near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to
  3451	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsupper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which
  3452	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tplaced them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find
  3453	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely,
  3454	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\topenly, and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane would soon
  3455	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe married to Mr. Bingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet
  3456	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tseemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the
  3457	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmatch. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but
  3458	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthree miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and
  3459	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthen it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of
  3460	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tJane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as
  3461	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger
  3462	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdaughters, as Jane’s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of
  3463	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tother rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be
  3464	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\table to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that
  3465	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was
  3466	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnecessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on
  3467	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuch occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.
  3468	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life. She
  3469	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconcluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally
  3470	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no
  3471	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tchance of it.
  3472	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3473	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIn vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother’s
  3474	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twords, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible
  3475	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the
  3476	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tchief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her
  3477	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmother only scolded her for being nonsensical.
  3478	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3479	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am
  3480	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say
  3481	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnothing _he_ may not like to hear.”
  3482	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3483	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“For heaven’s sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be for you
  3484	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by
  3485	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tso doing!”
  3486	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3487	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tNothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would
  3488	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttalk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and
  3489	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tblushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently
  3490	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tglancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what
  3491	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was
  3492	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconvinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression
  3493	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and
  3494	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsteady gravity.
  3495	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3496	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAt length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who
  3497	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no
  3498	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlikelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and
  3499	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tchicken. Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of
  3500	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttranquillity; for, when supper was over, singing was talked of, and
  3501	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,
  3502	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpreparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent
  3503	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tentreaties, did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance,
  3504	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbut in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of
  3505	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song. Elizabeth’s
  3506	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations, and she watched her
  3507	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tprogress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very
  3508	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\till rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving, amongst the thanks
  3509	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof the table, the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to
  3510	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfavour them again, after the pause of half a minute began another.
  3511	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMary’s powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was
  3512	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tweak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at
  3513	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tJane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to
  3514	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs
  3515	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,
  3516	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timperturbably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his
  3517	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinterference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,
  3518	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud, “That will do
  3519	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\textremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough. Let the other
  3520	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyoung ladies have time to exhibit.”
  3521	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3522	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and
  3523	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father’s speech, was afraid
  3524	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.
  3525	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3526	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“If I,” said Mr. Collins, “were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I
  3527	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshould have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an
  3528	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tair; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly
  3529	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcompatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however,
  3530	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time
  3531	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The
  3532	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make
  3533	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuch an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not
  3534	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\toffensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time
  3535	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care
  3536	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making
  3537	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance
  3538	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody,
  3539	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tespecially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit
  3540	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an
  3541	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\toccasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the
  3542	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfamily.” And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had
  3543	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeen spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room. Many stared--many
  3544	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsmiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his
  3545	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly,
  3546	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably
  3547	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tclever, good kind of young man.
  3548	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3549	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tTo Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement to
  3550	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texpose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would
  3551	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thave been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or
  3552	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfiner success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister
  3553	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his
  3554	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfeelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he
  3555	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmust have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should
  3556	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thave such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad enough,
  3557	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the
  3558	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.
  3559	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3560	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by
  3561	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side, and though
  3562	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\the could not prevail on her to dance with him again, put it out of her
  3563	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpower to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with
  3564	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsomebody else, and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room.
  3565	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHe assured her, that as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent to it;
  3566	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to
  3567	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her
  3568	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She owed
  3569	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who often joined them, and
  3570	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgood-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins’s conversation to herself.
  3571	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3572	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy’s further notice;
  3573	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthough often standing within a very short distance of her, quite
  3574	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdisengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the
  3575	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tprobable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in
  3576	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit.
  3577	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3578	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart, and, by
  3579	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their carriage a quarter of
  3580	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tan hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how
  3581	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\theartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her
  3582	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsister scarcely opened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and
  3583	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twere evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed
  3584	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tevery attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a
  3585	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlanguor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the
  3586	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlong speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his
  3587	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and
  3588	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpoliteness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said
  3589	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.
  3590	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the
  3591	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a
  3592	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsilence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too
  3593	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmuch fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “Lord,
  3594	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thow tired I am!” accompanied by a violent yawn.
  3595	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3596	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWhen at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly
  3597	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcivil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn, and
  3598	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taddressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he
  3599	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twould make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without
  3600	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure,
  3601	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on
  3602	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next
  3603	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tday for a short time.
  3604	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3605	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under the
  3606	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdelightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of
  3607	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsettlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly
  3608	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsee her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four
  3609	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmonths. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought
  3610	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.
  3611	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the
  3612	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tman and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each
  3613	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.
  3614	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t

  3617	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tChapter 19
  3618	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3619	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3620	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his
  3621	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdeclaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as
  3622	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having
  3623	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tno feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at
  3624	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the
  3625	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tobservances, which he supposed a regular part of the business. On
  3626	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfinding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together,
  3627	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsoon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words:
  3628	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3629	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,
  3630	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhen I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the
  3631	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcourse of this morning?”
  3632	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3633	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBefore Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs.
  3634	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBennet answered instantly, “Oh dear!--yes--certainly. I am sure Lizzy
  3635	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twill be very happy--I am sure she can have no objection. Come, Kitty, I
  3636	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twant you up stairs.” And, gathering her work together, she was hastening
  3637	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taway, when Elizabeth called out:
  3638	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3639	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Dear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuse
  3640	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tme. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am
  3641	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgoing away myself.”
  3642	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3643	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you to stay where you are.” And upon
  3644	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth’s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to
  3645	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tescape, she added: “Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing Mr.
  3646	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCollins.”
  3647	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3648	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment’s
  3649	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconsideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it
  3650	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tover as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again and tried to
  3651	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconceal, by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between
  3652	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdistress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as
  3653	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthey were gone, Mr. Collins began.
  3654	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3655	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from
  3656	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdoing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You
  3657	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twould have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little
  3658	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunwillingness; but allow me to assure you, that I have your respected
  3659	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmother’s permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the
  3660	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpurport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to
  3661	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as
  3662	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsoon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of
  3663	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmy future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this
  3664	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsubject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for
  3665	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmarrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design
  3666	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof selecting a wife, as I certainly did.”
  3667	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3668	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away
  3669	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing, that she could
  3670	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further,
  3671	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand he continued:
  3672	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3673	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for
  3674	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tevery clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example
  3675	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it will
  3676	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tadd very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly--which perhaps I ought
  3677	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and
  3678	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trecommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling
  3679	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpatroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked
  3680	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttoo!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I
  3681	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tleft Hunsford--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was
  3682	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tarranging Miss de Bourgh’s footstool, that she said, ‘Mr. Collins, you
  3683	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmust marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose
  3684	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active,
  3685	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tuseful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small
  3686	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tincome go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as
  3687	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.’ Allow me, by the
  3688	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tway, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice
  3689	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the
  3690	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tadvantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond
  3691	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tanything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be
  3692	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tacceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and
  3693	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trespect which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general
  3694	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tintention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views
  3695	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twere directed towards Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I
  3696	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcan assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that
  3697	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeing, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured
  3698	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfather (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy
  3699	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmyself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that
  3700	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy
  3701	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tevent takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not
  3702	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and
  3703	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing
  3704	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tremains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the
  3705	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tviolence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and
  3706	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well
  3707	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds
  3708	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin the four per cents, which will not be yours till after your mother’s
  3709	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdecease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,
  3710	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttherefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that
  3711	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tno ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.”
  3712	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3713	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIt was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.
  3714	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3715	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You are too hasty, sir,” she cried. “You forget that I have made no
  3716	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tanswer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for
  3717	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of
  3718	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyour proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to
  3719	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdecline them.”
  3720	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3721	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I am not now to learn,” replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the
  3722	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thand, “that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the
  3723	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tman whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their
  3724	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfavour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second, or even a
  3725	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthird time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just
  3726	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsaid, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.”
  3727	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3728	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Upon my word, sir,” cried Elizabeth, “your hope is a rather
  3729	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\textraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not
  3730	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tone of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so
  3731	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdaring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second
  3732	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttime. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make _me_
  3733	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thappy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who
  3734	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcould make you so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I
  3735	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tam persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the
  3736	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsituation.”
  3737	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3738	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,” said Mr. Collins
  3739	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvery gravely--“but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all
  3740	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdisapprove of you. And you may be certain when I have the honour of
  3741	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tseeing her again, I shall speak in the very highest terms of your
  3742	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmodesty, economy, and other amiable qualification.”
  3743	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3744	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You
  3745	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmust give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment
  3746	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by
  3747	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trefusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.
  3748	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIn making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your
  3749	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfeelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn
  3750	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\testate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may
  3751	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe considered, therefore, as finally settled.” And rising as she
  3752	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had Mr. Collins not thus
  3753	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taddressed her:
  3754	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3755	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I
  3756	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given
  3757	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tme; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I
  3758	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tknow it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on
  3759	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to
  3760	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tencourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the
  3761	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfemale character.”
  3762	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3763	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Really, Mr. Collins,” cried Elizabeth with some warmth, “you puzzle me
  3764	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form
  3765	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as
  3766	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto convince you of its being one.”
  3767	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3768	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your
  3769	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trefusal of my addresses is merely words of course. My reasons for
  3770	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbelieving it are briefly these: It does not appear to me that my hand is
  3771	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would
  3772	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections
  3773	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith the family of de Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are
  3774	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcircumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further
  3775	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconsideration, that in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no
  3776	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmeans certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your
  3777	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tportion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo
  3778	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must
  3779	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttherefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me,
  3780	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by
  3781	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.”
  3782	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3783	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind
  3784	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would
  3785	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you
  3786	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tagain and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but
  3787	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect
  3788	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tforbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant
  3789	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfemale, intending to plague you, but as a rational creature, speaking
  3790	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe truth from her heart.”
  3791	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3792	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You are uniformly charming!” cried he, with an air of awkward
  3793	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgallantry; “and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express
  3794	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tauthority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of
  3795	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeing acceptable.”
  3796	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3797	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tTo such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make
  3798	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tno reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if
  3799	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\the persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering
  3800	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tencouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered
  3801	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin such a manner as to be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could
  3802	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.

  3807	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3808	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3809	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his
  3810	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuccessful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule
  3811	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open
  3812	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she
  3813	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tentered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in
  3814	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twarm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collins
  3815	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treceived and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then
  3816	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tproceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result
  3817	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the
  3818	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trefusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow
  3819	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfrom her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.
  3820	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3821	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThis information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she would have been
  3822	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tglad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage
  3823	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it,
  3824	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand could not help saying so.
  3825	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3826	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins,” she added, “that Lizzy shall be
  3827	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbrought to reason. I will speak to her about it directly. She is a very
  3828	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\theadstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest but I will
  3829	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t_make_ her know it.”
  3830	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3831	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,” cried Mr. Collins; “but if
  3832	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would
  3833	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taltogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who
  3834	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnaturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If therefore she
  3835	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tactually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not
  3836	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto force her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of
  3837	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttemper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.”
  3838	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3839	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Sir, you quite misunderstand me,” said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. “Lizzy is
  3840	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tonly headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else she is as
  3841	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgood-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and
  3842	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twe shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.”
  3843	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3844	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her
  3845	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thusband, called out as she entered the library, “Oh! Mr. Bennet, you
  3846	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tare wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. You must come and make
  3847	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you
  3848	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdo not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_.”
  3849	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3850	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them
  3851	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ton her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by
  3852	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther communication.
  3853	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3854	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I have not the pleasure of understanding you,” said he, when she had
  3855	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfinished her speech. “Of what are you talking?”
  3856	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3857	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins,
  3858	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.”
  3859	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3860	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless business.”
  3861	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3862	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her
  3863	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmarrying him.”
  3864	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3865	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.”
  3866	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3867	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the
  3868	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlibrary.
  3869	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3870	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Come here, child,” cried her father as she appeared. “I have sent for
  3871	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made
  3872	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou an offer of marriage. Is it true?” Elizabeth replied that it was.
  3873	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?”
  3874	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3875	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I have, sir.”
  3876	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3877	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your
  3878	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taccepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?”
  3879	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3880	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes, or I will never see her again.”
  3881	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3882	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must
  3883	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you
  3884	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tagain if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again
  3885	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tif you _do_.”
  3886	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3887	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning,
  3888	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbut Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the
  3889	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taffair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.
  3890	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3891	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way? You promised me to
  3892	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t_insist_ upon her marrying him.”
  3893	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3894	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“My dear,” replied her husband, “I have two small favours to request.
  3895	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tFirst, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the
  3896	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpresent occasion; and secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the
  3897	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlibrary to myself as soon as may be.”
  3898	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3899	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tNot yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did
  3900	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again;
  3901	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcoaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane
  3902	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin her interest; but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined
  3903	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinterfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and
  3904	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks. Though her manner
  3905	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvaried, however, her determination never did.
  3906	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3907	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.
  3908	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHe thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin
  3909	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcould refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other
  3910	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tway. His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her
  3911	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdeserving her mother’s reproach prevented his feeling any regret.
  3912	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3913	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWhile the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend
  3914	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to
  3915	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther, cried in a half whisper, “I am glad you are come, for there is such
  3916	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfun here! What do you think has happened this morning? Mr. Collins has
  3917	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmade an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.”
  3918	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3919	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCharlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty,
  3920	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twho came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the
  3921	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbreakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on
  3922	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating
  3923	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her
  3924	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfamily. “Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,” she added in a melancholy tone,
  3925	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me. I am cruelly used,
  3926	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnobody feels for my poor nerves.”
  3927	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3928	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCharlotte’s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.
  3929	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3930	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Aye, there she comes,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “looking as unconcerned
  3931	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided
  3932	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe can have her own way. But I tell you, Miss Lizzy--if you take it
  3933	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinto your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,
  3934	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is
  3935	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto maintain you when your father is dead. I shall not be able to keep
  3936	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou--and so I warn you. I have done with you from this very day. I told
  3937	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again,
  3938	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking
  3939	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking
  3940	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have
  3941	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tno great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer! But it
  3942	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tis always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied.”
  3943	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3944	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHer daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that
  3945	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tany attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase the
  3946	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tirritation. She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of
  3947	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthem, till they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered the room with
  3948	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tan air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to
  3949	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe girls, “Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold
  3950	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyour tongues, and let me and Mr. Collins have a little conversation
  3951	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttogether.”
  3952	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3953	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but
  3954	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte,
  3955	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdetained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after
  3956	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\therself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little
  3957	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcuriosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending
  3958	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet began the projected
  3959	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconversation: “Oh! Mr. Collins!”
  3960	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3961	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“My dear madam,” replied he, “let us be for ever silent on this point.
  3962	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tFar be it from me,” he presently continued, in a voice that marked his
  3963	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdispleasure, “to resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation
  3964	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto inevitable evils is the duty of us all; the peculiar duty of a
  3965	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyoung man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment;
  3966	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand I trust I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt
  3967	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand;
  3968	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as
  3969	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhen the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our
  3970	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\testimation. You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect
  3971	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to
  3972	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyour daughter’s favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the
  3973	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcompliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my
  3974	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbehalf. My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my
  3975	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdismission from your daughter’s lips instead of your own. But we are all
  3976	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tliable to error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.
  3977	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMy object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due
  3978	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconsideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my _manner_
  3979	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thas been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologise.”
  3980	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t

  3983	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tChapter 21
  3984	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3985	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3986	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe discussion of Mr. Collins’s offer was now nearly at an end, and
  3987	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily
  3988	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tattending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her
  3989	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmother. As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly
  3990	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texpressed, not by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her,
  3991	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbut by stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke
  3992	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto her, and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of
  3993	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thimself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose
  3994	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcivility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and
  3995	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tespecially to her friend.
  3996	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  3997	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet’s ill-humour or ill
  3998	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thealth. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth
  3999	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did
  4000	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on
  4001	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tSaturday, and to Saturday he meant to stay.
  4002	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4003	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAfter breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr. Wickham
  4004	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twere returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.
  4005	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHe joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their
  4006	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taunt’s where his regret and vexation, and the concern of everybody, was
  4007	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twell talked over. To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged
  4008	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat the necessity of his absence _had_ been self-imposed.
  4009	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4010	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I found,” said he, “as the time drew near that I had better not meet
  4011	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so
  4012	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmany hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes
  4013	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmight arise unpleasant to more than myself.”
  4014	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4015	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full
  4016	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdiscussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly
  4017	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with
  4018	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthem to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to
  4019	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther. His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the
  4020	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcompliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an
  4021	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\toccasion of introducing him to her father and mother.
  4022	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4023	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tSoon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came
  4024	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfrom Netherfield. The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little,
  4025	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady’s fair, flowing hand; and
  4026	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth saw her sister’s countenance change as she read it, and saw
  4027	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther dwelling intently on some particular passages. Jane recollected
  4028	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\therself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual
  4029	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety
  4030	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ton the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no
  4031	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane
  4032	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinvited her to follow her up stairs. When they had gained their own room,
  4033	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tJane, taking out the letter, said:
  4034	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4035	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good
  4036	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdeal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on
  4037	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttheir way to town--and without any intention of coming back again. You
  4038	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshall hear what she says.”
  4039	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4040	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information
  4041	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,
  4042	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor Street, where Mr. Hurst had a
  4043	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thouse. The next was in these words: “I do not pretend to regret anything
  4044	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend;
  4045	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbut we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that
  4046	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdelightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may
  4047	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved
  4048	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcorrespondence. I depend on you for that.” To these highflown
  4049	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texpressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust;
  4050	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw
  4051	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their
  4052	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tabsence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley’s being there; and as
  4053	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must cease to
  4054	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tregard it, in the enjoyment of his.
  4055	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4056	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“It is unlucky,” said she, after a short pause, “that you should not be
  4057	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\table to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not
  4058	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks
  4059	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tforward may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful
  4060	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tintercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater
  4061	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsatisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by
  4062	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthem.”
  4063	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4064	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into
  4065	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you:”
  4066	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4067	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which
  4068	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttook him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we
  4069	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tare certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when
  4070	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCharles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have
  4071	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdetermined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend
  4072	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintances are
  4073	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\talready there for the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my
  4074	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdearest friend, had any intention of making one of the crowd--but of
  4075	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat I despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may
  4076	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tabound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your
  4077	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the
  4078	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthree of whom we shall deprive you.”
  4079	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4080	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“It is evident by this,” added Jane, “that he comes back no more this
  4081	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twinter.”
  4082	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4083	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he _should_.”
  4084	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4085	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Why will you think so? It must be his own doing. He is his own
  4086	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmaster. But you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage which
  4087	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tparticularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_.”
  4088	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4089	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the truth,
  4090	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t_we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think
  4091	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tGeorgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments;
  4092	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into
  4093	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsomething still more interesting, from the hope we dare entertain of
  4094	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before
  4095	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmentioned to you my feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the
  4096	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcountry without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them
  4097	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will have
  4098	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfrequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing;
  4099	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister’s
  4100	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpartiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most
  4101	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcapable of engaging any woman’s heart. With all these circumstances to
  4102	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfavour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest
  4103	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tJane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness
  4104	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof so many?”
  4105	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4106	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“What do you think of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?” said Jane as she
  4107	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfinished it. “Is it not clear enough? Does it not expressly declare that
  4108	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCaroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is
  4109	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tperfectly convinced of her brother’s indifference; and that if she
  4110	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to
  4111	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tput me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?”
  4112	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4113	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?”
  4114	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4115	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Most willingly.”
  4116	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4117	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is
  4118	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him
  4119	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto town in hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he
  4120	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdoes not care about you.”
  4121	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4122	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tJane shook her head.
  4123	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4124	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you
  4125	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttogether can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot. She
  4126	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tis not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr.
  4127	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tDarcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the
  4128	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcase is this: We are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she
  4129	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tis the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion
  4130	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble
  4131	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and
  4132	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But,
  4133	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmy dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley
  4134	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest
  4135	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdegree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on
  4136	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tTuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead
  4137	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.”
  4138	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4139	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,” replied Jane, “your
  4140	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trepresentation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the
  4141	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfoundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving
  4142	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tanyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that she is deceiving
  4143	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\therself.”
  4144	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4145	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you
  4146	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twill not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be deceived, by all means.
  4147	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tYou have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.”
  4148	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4149	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in
  4150	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taccepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry
  4151	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\telsewhere?”
  4152	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4153	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You must decide for yourself,” said Elizabeth; “and if, upon mature
  4154	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdeliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is
  4155	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmore than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by
  4156	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tall means to refuse him.”
  4157	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4158	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“How can you talk so?” said Jane, faintly smiling. “You must know that
  4159	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthough I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could
  4160	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot hesitate.”
  4161	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4162	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider
  4163	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyour situation with much compassion.”
  4164	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4165	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be
  4166	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trequired. A thousand things may arise in six months!”
  4167	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4168	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost
  4169	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcontempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline’s
  4170	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinterested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those
  4171	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man
  4172	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tso totally independent of everyone.
  4173	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4174	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt
  4175	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ton the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.
  4176	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tJane’s temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope,
  4177	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthough the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that
  4178	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.
  4179	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4180	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThey agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the
  4181	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfamily, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman’s conduct;
  4182	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbut even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,
  4183	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen
  4184	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. After
  4185	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation that Mr.
  4186	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the
  4187	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconclusion of all was the comfortable declaration, that though he had
  4188	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeen invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have two

  4195	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4196	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again during the
  4197	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tchief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.
  4198	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. “It keeps him in good
  4199	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thumour,” said she, “and I am more obliged to you than I can express.”
  4200	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and
  4201	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was
  4202	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvery amiable, but Charlotte’s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth
  4203	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad any conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her
  4204	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfrom any return of Mr. Collins’s addresses, by engaging them towards
  4205	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\therself. Such was Miss Lucas’s scheme; and appearances were so
  4206	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfavourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost
  4207	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsecure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very
  4208	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsoon. But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his
  4209	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcharacter, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next
  4210	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmorning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw
  4211	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thimself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,
  4212	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfrom a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to
  4213	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known
  4214	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttill its success might be known likewise; for though feeling almost
  4215	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsecure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,
  4216	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\the was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday.
  4217	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHis reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas
  4218	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tperceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and
  4219	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinstantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had
  4220	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.
  4221	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4222	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIn as short a time as Mr. Collins’s long speeches would allow,
  4223	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teverything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as
  4224	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthey entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that
  4225	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must
  4226	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with
  4227	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must
  4228	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tguard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its
  4229	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcontinuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure
  4230	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that
  4231	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\testablishment were gained.
  4232	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4233	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tSir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;
  4234	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins’s present
  4235	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcircumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom
  4236	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthey could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were
  4237	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more
  4238	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinterest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer
  4239	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided
  4240	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\topinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the
  4241	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLongbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife
  4242	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshould make their appearance at St. James’s. The whole family, in short,
  4243	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twere properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes
  4244	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have
  4245	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdone; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte’s
  4246	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdying an old maid. Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had
  4247	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgained her point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were
  4248	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible
  4249	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must
  4250	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe imaginary. But still he would be her husband. Without thinking highly
  4251	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teither of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was
  4252	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune,
  4253	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest
  4254	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpreservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at
  4255	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all
  4256	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe good luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business
  4257	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship
  4258	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe valued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder,
  4259	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be
  4260	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved
  4261	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto give her the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins,
  4262	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhen he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had
  4263	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpassed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very
  4264	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the
  4265	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcuriosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct
  4266	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tquestions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was
  4267	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tat the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to
  4268	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpublish his prosperous love.
  4269	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4270	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAs he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the
  4271	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfamily, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved
  4272	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and cordiality,
  4273	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsaid how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever
  4274	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this engagements might allow him to visit them.
  4275	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4276	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“My dear madam,” he replied, “this invitation is particularly
  4277	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and
  4278	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as
  4279	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpossible.”
  4280	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4281	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThey were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for
  4282	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tso speedy a return, immediately said:
  4283	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4284	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“But is there not danger of Lady Catherine’s disapprobation here, my
  4285	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgood sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of
  4286	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\toffending your patroness.”
  4287	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4288	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“My dear sir,” replied Mr. Collins, “I am particularly obliged to you
  4289	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so
  4290	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmaterial a step without her ladyship’s concurrence.”
  4291	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4292	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything rather than her
  4293	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdispleasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us
  4294	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tagain, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,
  4295	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence.”
  4296	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4297	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such
  4298	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taffectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive
  4299	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfrom me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other mark of your
  4300	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tregard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins, though
  4301	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmy absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall now
  4302	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttake the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting my
  4303	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcousin Elizabeth.”
  4304	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4305	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWith proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally
  4306	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsurprised that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished to
  4307	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunderstand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her
  4308	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyounger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.
  4309	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was
  4310	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no
  4311	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmeans so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read
  4312	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very
  4313	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tagreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of this
  4314	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tkind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a
  4315	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tprivate conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.
  4316	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4317	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe possibility of Mr. Collins’s fancying himself in love with her
  4318	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfriend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but
  4319	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from
  4320	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpossibility as she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was
  4321	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconsequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and
  4322	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe could not help crying out:
  4323	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4324	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Engaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotte--impossible!”
  4325	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4326	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her
  4327	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tstory, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a
  4328	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained
  4329	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther composure, and calmly replied:
  4330	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4331	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible
  4332	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman’s good opinion,
  4333	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbecause he was not so happy as to succeed with you?”
  4334	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4335	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBut Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort
  4336	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of
  4337	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttheir relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her
  4338	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tall imaginable happiness.
  4339	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4340	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I see what you are feeling,” replied Charlotte. “You must be surprised,
  4341	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvery much surprised--so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry
  4342	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou. But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be
  4343	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsatisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know; I never
  4344	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins’s
  4345	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcharacter, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my
  4346	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tchance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on
  4347	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tentering the marriage state.”
  4348	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4349	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth quietly answered “Undoubtedly;” and after an awkward pause,
  4350	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthey returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much
  4351	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlonger, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard.
  4352	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIt was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so
  4353	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins’s making two offers
  4354	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now
  4355	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taccepted. She had always felt that Charlotte’s opinion of matrimony was
  4356	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible
  4357	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better
  4358	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfeeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins was a
  4359	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmost humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself
  4360	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction that it
  4361	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had
  4362	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tchosen.
  4363	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t

  4367	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4368	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4369	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what
  4370	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe had heard, and doubting whether she was authorised to mention
  4371	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter, to
  4372	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tannounce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them,
  4373	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the
  4374	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thouses, he unfolded the matter--to an audience not merely wondering, but
  4375	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tincredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness,
  4376	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tprotested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and
  4377	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\toften uncivil, boisterously exclaimed:
  4378	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4379	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know
  4380	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?”
  4381	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4382	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tNothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne
  4383	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twithout anger such treatment; but Sir William’s good breeding carried
  4384	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the
  4385	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttruth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the
  4386	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmost forbearing courtesy.
  4387	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4388	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant
  4389	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by
  4390	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and
  4391	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tendeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters
  4392	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tby the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she
  4393	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the
  4394	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thappiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character
  4395	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.
  4396	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4397	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while
  4398	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tSir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings
  4399	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfound a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving
  4400	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins
  4401	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be
  4402	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thappy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two
  4403	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that
  4404	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth was the real cause of the mischief; and the other that she
  4405	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\therself had been barbarously misused by them all; and on these two
  4406	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpoints she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could
  4407	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconsole and nothing could appease her. Nor did that day wear out her
  4408	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tresentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without
  4409	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tscolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William
  4410	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tor Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she
  4411	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcould at all forgive their daughter.
  4412	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4413	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Bennet’s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such
  4414	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for
  4415	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had
  4416	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeen used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and
  4417	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmore foolish than his daughter!
  4418	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4419	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tJane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said
  4420	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tless of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;
  4421	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty
  4422	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a
  4423	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tclergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news
  4424	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto spread at Meryton.
  4425	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4426	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort
  4427	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ton Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she
  4428	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcalled at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,
  4429	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthough Mrs. Bennet’s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been
  4430	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tenough to drive happiness away.
  4431	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4432	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBetween Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them
  4433	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that
  4434	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tno real confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her
  4435	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdisappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her
  4436	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could
  4437	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnever be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious,
  4438	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas Bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his
  4439	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treturn.
  4440	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4441	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tJane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting
  4442	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised
  4443	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tletter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to
  4444	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttheir father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a
  4445	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttwelvemonth’s abode in the family might have prompted. After discharging
  4446	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many
  4447	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection
  4448	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was
  4449	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmerely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready
  4450	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither
  4451	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\the hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine,
  4452	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\the added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take
  4453	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tplace as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable
  4454	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\targument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him
  4455	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe happiest of men.
  4456	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4457	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Collins’s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of
  4458	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much disposed to
  4459	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcomplain of it as her husband. It was very strange that he should come
  4460	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient
  4461	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand exceedingly troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house
  4462	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhile her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the
  4463	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmost disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and
  4464	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthey gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley’s continued
  4465	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tabsence.
  4466	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4467	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tNeither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after
  4468	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tday passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the
  4469	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treport which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to
  4470	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tNetherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.
  4471	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous
  4472	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfalsehood.
  4473	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4474	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tEven Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that
  4475	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as
  4476	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane’s happiness, and so
  4477	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdishonorable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its
  4478	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfrequently occurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters
  4479	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss
  4480	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tDarcy and the amusements of London might be too much, she feared, for
  4481	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe strength of his attachment.
  4482	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4483	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAs for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more
  4484	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpainful than Elizabeth’s, but whatever she felt she was desirous of
  4485	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconcealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject
  4486	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother,
  4487	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tan hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her
  4488	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timpatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he
  4489	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdid not come back she would think herself very ill used. It needed
  4490	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tall Jane’s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable
  4491	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttranquillity.
  4492	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4493	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but his
  4494	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his
  4495	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfirst introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention;
  4496	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them
  4497	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfrom a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by
  4498	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time
  4499	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.
  4500	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4501	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of
  4502	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tanything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour,
  4503	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight
  4504	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she
  4505	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tregarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see
  4506	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthem, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and
  4507	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that
  4508	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthey were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself
  4509	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead. She
  4510	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcomplained bitterly of all this to her husband.
  4511	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4512	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Indeed, Mr. Bennet,” said she, “it is very hard to think that Charlotte
  4513	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to
  4514	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmake way for _her_, and live to see her take her place in it!”
  4515	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4516	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for
  4517	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbetter things. Let us flatter ourselves that I may be the survivor.”
  4518	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4519	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThis was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead of
  4520	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmaking any answer, she went on as before.
  4521	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4522	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was
  4523	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot for the entail, I should not mind it.”
  4524	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4525	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“What should not you mind?”
  4526	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4527	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I should not mind anything at all.”
  4528	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4529	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such
  4530	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinsensibility.”
  4531	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4532	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How
  4533	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tanyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one’s own
  4534	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdaughters, I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too!
  4535	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWhy should _he_ have it more than anybody else?”
  4536	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4537	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I leave it to yourself to determine,” said Mr. Bennet.
  4538	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t

  4541	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tChapter 24
  4542	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4543	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4544	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMiss Bingley’s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first
  4545	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for
  4546	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe winter, and concluded with her brother’s regret at not having had
  4547	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttime to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left
  4548	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe country.
  4549	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4550	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest
  4551	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the
  4552	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twriter, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy’s praise occupied
  4553	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on, and Caroline
  4554	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tboasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict
  4555	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former
  4556	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tletter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother’s being an
  4557	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinmate of Mr. Darcy’s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of
  4558	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe latter with regard to new furniture.
  4559	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4560	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,
  4561	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\theard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern
  4562	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor her sister, and resentment against all others. To Caroline’s
  4563	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tassertion of her brother’s being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no
  4564	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcredit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she
  4565	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she
  4566	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcould not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness
  4567	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave
  4568	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness
  4569	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto the caprice of their inclination. Had his own happiness, however,
  4570	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeen the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in
  4571	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhatever manner he thought best, but her sister’s was involved in it, as
  4572	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short,
  4573	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ton which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She
  4574	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcould think of nothing else; and yet whether Bingley’s regard had really
  4575	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdied away, or were suppressed by his friends’ interference; whether
  4576	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\the had been aware of Jane’s attachment, or whether it had escaped his
  4577	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tobservation; whatever were the case, though her opinion of him must be
  4578	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmaterially affected by the difference, her sister’s situation remained
  4579	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe same, her peace equally wounded.
  4580	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4581	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tA day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to
  4582	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet’s leaving them together, after a
  4583	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlonger irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could
  4584	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot help saying:
  4585	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4586	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself! She can have no
  4587	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tidea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But
  4588	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI will not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall
  4589	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tall be as we were before.”
  4590	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4591	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said
  4592	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnothing.
  4593	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4594	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You doubt me,” cried Jane, slightly colouring; “indeed, you have
  4595	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tno reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my
  4596	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tacquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear,
  4597	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand nothing to reproach him with. Thank God! I have not _that_ pain. A
  4598	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlittle time, therefore--I shall certainly try to get the better.”
  4599	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4600	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWith a stronger voice she soon added, “I have this comfort immediately,
  4601	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it
  4602	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thas done no harm to anyone but myself.”
  4603	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4604	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“My dear Jane!” exclaimed Elizabeth, “you are too good. Your sweetness
  4605	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say
  4606	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you
  4607	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdeserve.”
  4608	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4609	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMiss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back
  4610	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe praise on her sister’s warm affection.
  4611	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4612	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Nay,” said Elizabeth, “this is not fair. _You_ wish to think all the
  4613	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tworld respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. I only want
  4614	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not
  4615	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your
  4616	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tprivilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people
  4617	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see
  4618	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms
  4619	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmy belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the
  4620	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlittle dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or
  4621	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsense. I have met with two instances lately, one I will not mention; the
  4622	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tother is Charlotte’s marriage. It is unaccountable! In every view it is
  4623	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunaccountable!”
  4624	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4625	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will
  4626	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\truin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference
  4627	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins’s respectability, and
  4628	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCharlotte’s steady, prudent character. Remember that she is one of a
  4629	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlarge family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be
  4630	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tready to believe, for everybody’s sake, that she may feel something like
  4631	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tregard and esteem for our cousin.”
  4632	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4633	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else
  4634	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcould be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that
  4635	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCharlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her
  4636	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunderstanding than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a
  4637	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man; you know he is, as well as
  4638	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who married him
  4639	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though
  4640	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual,
  4641	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tchange the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade
  4642	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of
  4643	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdanger security for happiness.”
  4644	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4645	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,” replied
  4646	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tJane; “and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy
  4647	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttogether. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. You
  4648	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmentioned _two_ instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat
  4649	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and
  4650	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsaying your opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy
  4651	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man
  4652	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but
  4653	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tour own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than
  4654	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit does.”
  4655	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4656	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And men take care that they should.”
  4657	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4658	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea
  4659	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.”
  4660	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4661	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley’s conduct to design,”
  4662	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t said Elizabeth; “but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others
  4663	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness,
  4664	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twant of attention to other people’s feelings, and want of resolution,
  4665	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twill do the business.”
  4666	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4667	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And do you impute it to either of those?”
  4668	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4669	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by saying what
  4670	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you can.”
  4671	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4672	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?”
  4673	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4674	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes, in conjunction with his friend.”
  4675	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4676	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They can
  4677	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tonly wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me, no other woman can
  4678	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsecure it.”
  4679	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4680	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides his
  4681	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thappiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they
  4682	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmay wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great
  4683	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconnections, and pride.”
  4684	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4685	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to choose Miss Darcy,” replied Jane;
  4686	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They have
  4687	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tknown her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love
  4688	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely
  4689	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthey should have opposed their brother’s. What sister would think
  4690	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\therself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very
  4691	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tobjectionable? If they believed him attached to me, they would not try
  4692	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto part us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an
  4693	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taffection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most
  4694	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been
  4695	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmistaken--or, at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison of what
  4696	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it in
  4697	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe best light, in the light in which it may be understood.”
  4698	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4699	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley’s
  4700	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tname was scarcely ever mentioned between them.
  4701	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4702	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no
  4703	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmore, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account
  4704	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor it clearly, there was little chance of her ever considering it with
  4705	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tless perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she
  4706	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdid not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the
  4707	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teffect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her
  4708	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tno more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at
  4709	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe time, she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet’s best
  4710	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcomfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.
  4711	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4712	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Bennet treated the matter differently. “So, Lizzy,” said he one day,
  4713	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“your sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate her. Next to
  4714	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeing married, a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then.
  4715	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIt is something to think of, and it gives her a sort of distinction
  4716	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tamong her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to
  4717	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough in
  4718	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMeryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham
  4719	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe _your_ man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.”
  4720	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4721	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not
  4722	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tall expect Jane’s good fortune.”
  4723	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4724	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“True,” said Mr. Bennet, “but it is a comfort to think that whatever of
  4725	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat kind may befall you, you have an affectionate mother who will make
  4726	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe most of it.”
  4727	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4728	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Wickham’s society was of material service in dispelling the gloom
  4729	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhich the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn
  4730	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfamily. They saw him often, and to his other recommendations was now
  4731	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tadded that of general unreserve. The whole of what Elizabeth had already
  4732	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\theard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him,
  4733	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was
  4734	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpleased to know how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they
  4735	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad known anything of the matter.
  4736	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4737	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMiss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be
  4738	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tany extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the society
  4739	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof Hertfordshire; her mild and steady candour always pleaded for
  4740	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tallowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes--but by everybody else
  4741	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.

  4747	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4748	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAfter a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity,
  4749	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of
  4750	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tSaturday. The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his
  4751	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tside, by preparations for the reception of his bride; as he had reason
  4752	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto hope, that shortly after his return into Hertfordshire, the day would
  4753	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave of his
  4754	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trelations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair
  4755	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another
  4756	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tletter of thanks.
  4757	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4758	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tOn the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving
  4759	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas
  4760	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tat Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly
  4761	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuperior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield
  4762	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived
  4763	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tby trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so
  4764	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twell-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger
  4765	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthan Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant
  4766	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twoman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces. Between the
  4767	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttwo eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a particular regard.
  4768	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThey had frequently been staying with her in town.
  4769	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4770	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe first part of Mrs. Gardiner’s business on her arrival was to
  4771	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdistribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was
  4772	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdone she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen.
  4773	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They
  4774	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her
  4775	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgirls had been upon the point of marriage, and after all there was
  4776	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnothing in it.
  4777	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4778	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I do not blame Jane,” she continued, “for Jane would have got Mr.
  4779	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBingley if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, sister! It is very hard to think
  4780	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat she might have been Mr. Collins’s wife by this time, had it not
  4781	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeen for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room,
  4782	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have
  4783	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta daughter married before I have, and that the Longbourn estate is just
  4784	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed,
  4785	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of
  4786	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthem, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted
  4787	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tso in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves
  4788	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbefore anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the
  4789	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgreatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of
  4790	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlong sleeves.”
  4791	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4792	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before,
  4793	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin the course of Jane and Elizabeth’s correspondence with her, made her
  4794	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the
  4795	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconversation.
  4796	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4797	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWhen alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject. “It
  4798	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tseems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,” said she. “I am
  4799	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsorry it went off. But these things happen so often! A young man, such
  4800	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl
  4801	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets
  4802	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther, that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent.”
  4803	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4804	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“An excellent consolation in its way,” said Elizabeth, “but it will not
  4805	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdo for _us_. We do not suffer by _accident_. It does not often
  4806	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thappen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of
  4807	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tindependent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in
  4808	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlove with only a few days before.”
  4809	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4810	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“But that expression of ‘violently in love’ is so hackneyed, so
  4811	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdoubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as
  4812	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\toften applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour’s acquaintance,
  4813	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how _violent was_ Mr. Bingley’s
  4814	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlove?”
  4815	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4816	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite
  4817	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time
  4818	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthey met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he
  4819	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\toffended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance; and I
  4820	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tspoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer. Could there be
  4821	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfiner symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?”
  4822	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4823	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh, yes!--of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. Poor
  4824	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tJane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get
  4825	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tover it immediately. It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you
  4826	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twould have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she
  4827	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twould be prevailed upon to go back with us? Change of scene might be
  4828	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof service--and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as
  4829	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tanything.”
  4830	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4831	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded
  4832	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof her sister’s ready acquiescence.
  4833	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4834	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I hope,” added Mrs. Gardiner, “that no consideration with regard to
  4835	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthis young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of
  4836	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttown, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go
  4837	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tout so little, that it is very improbable that they should meet at all,
  4838	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunless he really comes to see her.”
  4839	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4840	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his
  4841	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfriend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such
  4842	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may
  4843	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tperhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he
  4844	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twould hardly think a month’s ablution enough to cleanse him from its
  4845	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timpurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley
  4846	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnever stirs without him.”
  4847	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4848	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane
  4849	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcorrespond with his sister? _She_ will not be able to help calling.”
  4850	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4851	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“She will drop the acquaintance entirely.”
  4852	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4853	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBut in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this
  4854	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpoint, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley’s being
  4855	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twithheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which
  4856	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconvinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely
  4857	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that
  4858	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this affection might be reanimated, and the influence of his friends
  4859	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuccessfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane’s
  4860	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tattractions.
  4861	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4862	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMiss Bennet accepted her aunt’s invitation with pleasure; and the
  4863	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time, than as she
  4864	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thoped by Caroline’s not living in the same house with her brother,
  4865	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of
  4866	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tseeing him.
  4867	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4868	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Phillipses,
  4869	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its
  4870	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tengagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment
  4871	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family
  4872	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always
  4873	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmade part of it--of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and
  4874	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ton these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth’s
  4875	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twarm commendation, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing them,
  4876	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfrom what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference
  4877	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and
  4878	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left
  4879	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such
  4880	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tan attachment.
  4881	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4882	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tTo Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,
  4883	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunconnected with his general powers. About ten or a dozen years ago,
  4884	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbefore her marriage, she had spent a considerable time in that very
  4885	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpart of Derbyshire to which he belonged. They had, therefore, many
  4886	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tacquaintances in common; and though Wickham had been little there since
  4887	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe death of Darcy’s father, it was yet in his power to give her fresher
  4888	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tintelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of
  4889	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tprocuring.
  4890	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4891	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by
  4892	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcharacter perfectly well. Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject
  4893	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof discourse. In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with the minute
  4894	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdescription which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of
  4895	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpraise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both
  4896	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim and herself. On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy’s
  4897	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttreatment of him, she tried to remember some of that gentleman’s
  4898	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it, and
  4899	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas confident at last that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam
  4900	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tDarcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.

  4906	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4907	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Gardiner’s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given
  4908	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ton the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after
  4909	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thonestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:
  4910	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4911	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because
  4912	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking
  4913	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\topenly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve
  4914	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want
  4915	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against
  4916	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t_him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he
  4917	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is, you
  4918	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmust not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all
  4919	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texpect you to use it. Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and
  4920	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgood conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father.”
  4921	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4922	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.”
  4923	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4924	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.”
  4925	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4926	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of
  4927	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmyself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I
  4928	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcan prevent it.”
  4929	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4930	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Elizabeth, you are not serious now.”
  4931	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4932	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in love with
  4933	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison,
  4934	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to
  4935	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tme--I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence
  4936	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof it. Oh! _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy! My father’s opinion of me does
  4937	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tme the greatest honour, and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My
  4938	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfather, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I
  4939	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshould be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but
  4940	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsince we see every day that where there is affection, young people
  4941	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tare seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into
  4942	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tengagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many
  4943	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it
  4944	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twould be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is not
  4945	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first
  4946	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tobject. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In short,
  4947	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI will do my best.”
  4948	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4949	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very
  4950	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\toften. At least, you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him.”
  4951	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4952	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“As I did the other day,” said Elizabeth with a conscious smile: “very
  4953	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttrue, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_. But do not imagine
  4954	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been
  4955	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tso frequently invited this week. You know my mother’s ideas as to the
  4956	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnecessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my
  4957	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thonour, I will try to do what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope
  4958	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou are satisfied.”
  4959	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4960	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHer aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked her for
  4961	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice
  4962	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeing given on such a point, without being resented.
  4963	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4964	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted
  4965	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tby the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases,
  4966	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His marriage was
  4967	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnow fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think
  4968	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that
  4969	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe “_wished_ they might be happy.” Thursday was to be the wedding day,
  4970	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she
  4971	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother’s ungracious and
  4972	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her
  4973	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tout of the room. As they went downstairs together, Charlotte said:
  4974	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4975	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.”
  4976	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4977	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“_That_ you certainly shall.”
  4978	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4979	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And I have another favour to ask you. Will you come and see me?”
  4980	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4981	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.”
  4982	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4983	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to
  4984	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcome to Hunsford.”
  4985	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4986	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the
  4987	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvisit.
  4988	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4989	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“My father and Maria are coming to me in March,” added Charlotte, “and I
  4990	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be as
  4991	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twelcome as either of them.”
  4992	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  4993	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from
  4994	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to hear, on
  4995	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their
  4996	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcorrespondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that
  4997	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit should be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never
  4998	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taddress her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over,
  4999	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the
  5000	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsake of what had been, rather than what was. Charlotte’s first letters
  5001	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twere received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be
  5002	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcuriosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would
  5003	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlike Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to
  5004	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte
  5005	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texpressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She
  5006	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing
  5007	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhich she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and
  5008	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\troads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine’s behaviour was most
  5009	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfriendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins’s picture of Hunsford and
  5010	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tRosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait
  5011	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor her own visit there to know the rest.
  5012	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5013	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tJane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their
  5014	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsafe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it
  5015	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twould be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.
  5016	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5017	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHer impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience
  5018	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgenerally is. Jane had been a week in town without either seeing or
  5019	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that
  5020	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been
  5021	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlost.
  5022	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5023	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“My aunt,” she continued, “is going to-morrow into that part of the
  5024	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttown, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.”
  5025	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5026	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.
  5027	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I did not think Caroline in spirits,” were her words, “but she was very
  5028	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tglad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming
  5029	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto London. I was right, therefore, my last letter had never reached
  5030	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther. I inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much
  5031	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tengaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that
  5032	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMiss Darcy was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was
  5033	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall
  5034	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsee them soon here.”
  5035	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5036	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that
  5037	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taccident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister’s being in town.
  5038	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5039	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tFour weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to
  5040	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpersuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be
  5041	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tblind to Miss Bingley’s inattention. After waiting at home every morning
  5042	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the
  5043	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvisitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more,
  5044	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no
  5045	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlonger. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will
  5046	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tprove what she felt.
  5047	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5048	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her
  5049	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbetter judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to have been
  5050	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tentirely deceived in Miss Bingley’s regard for me. But, my dear sister,
  5051	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthough the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I
  5052	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tstill assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was
  5053	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her reason for
  5054	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumstances were to
  5055	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thappen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not
  5056	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treturn my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I
  5057	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treceive in the meantime. When she did come, it was very evident that
  5058	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe had no pleasure in it; she made a slight, formal apology, for not
  5059	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcalling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and was
  5060	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin every respect so altered a creature, that when she went away I was
  5061	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tperfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity,
  5062	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthough I cannot help blaming her. She was very wrong in singling me out
  5063	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas she did; I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on
  5064	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been acting
  5065	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the
  5066	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and though _we_ know
  5067	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthis anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she feels it, it will easily
  5068	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taccount for her behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he is to
  5069	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this sister, whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and
  5070	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tamiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her having any such fears now,
  5071	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbecause, if he had at all cared about me, we must have met, long ago.
  5072	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHe knows of my being in town, I am certain, from something she said
  5073	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\therself; and yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she
  5074	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I
  5075	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcannot understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should
  5076	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity
  5077	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin all this. But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought,
  5078	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand think only of what will make me happy--your affection, and the
  5079	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinvariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you very
  5080	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsoon. Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield
  5081	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tagain, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty. We had better
  5082	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot mention it. I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts
  5083	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfrom our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and
  5084	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMaria. I am sure you will be very comfortable there.--Yours, etc.”
  5085	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5086	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThis letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she
  5087	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconsidered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.
  5088	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAll expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not
  5089	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teven wish for a renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on
  5090	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tevery review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible
  5091	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tadvantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr.
  5092	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tDarcy’s sister, as by Wickham’s account, she would make him abundantly
  5093	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tregret what he had thrown away.
  5094	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5095	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise
  5096	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconcerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth
  5097	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to
  5098	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\therself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,
  5099	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\the was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to
  5100	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsee it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.
  5101	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHer heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied
  5102	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune
  5103	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpermitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most
  5104	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tremarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself
  5105	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tagreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than
  5106	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin Charlotte’s, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.
  5107	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tNothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to
  5108	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was
  5109	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very
  5110	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsincerely wish him happy.
  5111	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5112	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAll this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the
  5113	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcircumstances, she thus went on: “I am now convinced, my dear aunt, that
  5114	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure
  5115	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and
  5116	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial
  5117	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttowards _him_; they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find
  5118	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tout that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to
  5119	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthink her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My
  5120	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twatchfulness has been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more
  5121	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinteresting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in love
  5122	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.
  5123	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tImportance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take
  5124	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the
  5125	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that
  5126	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thandsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain.”
  5127	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t

  5130	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tChapter 27
  5131	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5132	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5133	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWith no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise
  5134	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdiversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and
  5135	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take
  5136	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of
  5137	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgoing thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan
  5138	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure
  5139	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing
  5140	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCharlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There
  5141	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such
  5142	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tuncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change
  5143	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would moreover give her
  5144	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have
  5145	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeen very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly,
  5146	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand was finally settled according to Charlotte’s first sketch. She was
  5147	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement
  5148	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became
  5149	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tperfect as plan could be.
  5150	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5151	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,
  5152	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he
  5153	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttold her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.
  5154	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5155	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on
  5156	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that
  5157	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the
  5158	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfirst to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner
  5159	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of
  5160	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhat she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their
  5161	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\topinion of her--their opinion of everybody--would always coincide, there
  5162	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to
  5163	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced that,
  5164	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable
  5165	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand pleasing.
  5166	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5167	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHer fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her
  5168	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthink him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a
  5169	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgood-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say
  5170	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much
  5171	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdelight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but
  5172	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe had known Sir William’s too long. He could tell her nothing new of
  5173	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were
  5174	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tworn out, like his information.
  5175	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5176	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIt was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early
  5177	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner’s
  5178	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdoor, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when
  5179	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthey entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,
  5180	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlooking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and
  5181	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,
  5182	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhose eagerness for their cousin’s appearance would not allow them to
  5183	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen
  5184	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and
  5185	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tkindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and
  5186	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.
  5187	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5188	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first object was her
  5189	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to
  5190	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her
  5191	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tspirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however,
  5192	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto hope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the
  5193	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tparticulars also of Miss Bingley’s visit in Gracechurch Street, and
  5194	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trepeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and
  5195	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\therself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the
  5196	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tacquaintance.
  5197	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5198	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham’s desertion, and
  5199	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcomplimented her on bearing it so well.
  5200	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5201	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“But my dear Elizabeth,” she added, “what sort of girl is Miss King? I
  5202	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshould be sorry to think our friend mercenary.”
  5203	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5204	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,
  5205	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbetween the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end,
  5206	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,
  5207	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbecause it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get
  5208	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is
  5209	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmercenary.”
  5210	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5211	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know
  5212	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhat to think.”
  5213	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5214	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her.”
  5215	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5216	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather’s death
  5217	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmade her mistress of this fortune.”
  5218	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5219	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“No--why should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain _my_
  5220	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taffections because I had no money, what occasion could there be for
  5221	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmaking love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally
  5222	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpoor?”
  5223	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5224	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“But there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her
  5225	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tso soon after this event.”
  5226	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5227	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant
  5228	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdecorums which other people may observe. If _she_ does not object to it,
  5229	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhy should _we_?”
  5230	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5231	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“_Her_ not objecting does not justify _him_. It only shows her being
  5232	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdeficient in something herself--sense or feeling.”
  5233	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5234	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Well,” cried Elizabeth, “have it as you choose. _He_ shall be
  5235	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish.”
  5236	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5237	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose. I should be sorry, you know,
  5238	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.”
  5239	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5240	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in
  5241	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tDerbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not
  5242	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmuch better. I am sick of them all. Thank Heaven! I am going to-morrow
  5243	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhere I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has
  5244	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tneither manner nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones
  5245	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tworth knowing, after all.”
  5246	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5247	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.”
  5248	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5249	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBefore they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the
  5250	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in
  5251	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.
  5252	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5253	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“We have not determined how far it shall carry us,” said Mrs. Gardiner,
  5254	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“but, perhaps, to the Lakes.”
  5255	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5256	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tNo scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her
  5257	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tacceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. “Oh, my dear,
  5258	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdear aunt,” she rapturously cried, “what delight! what felicity! You
  5259	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgive me fresh life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What
  5260	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tare young men to rocks and mountains? Oh! what hours of transport
  5261	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twe shall spend! And when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other
  5262	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttravellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of anything. We
  5263	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t_will_ know where we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen.
  5264	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLakes, mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our
  5265	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene,
  5266	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twill we begin quarreling about its relative situation. Let _our_
  5267	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfirst effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of
  5268	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttravellers.”
  5269	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5270	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5271	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5272	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tChapter 28
  5273	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5274	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5275	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tEvery object in the next day’s journey was new and interesting to
  5276	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had
  5277	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tseen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,
  5278	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.
  5279	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5280	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWhen they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in
  5281	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsearch of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.
  5282	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe palings of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth
  5283	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsmiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.
  5284	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5285	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAt length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the
  5286	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\troad, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the laurel hedge,
  5287	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teverything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte
  5288	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tappeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate which
  5289	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tled by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of
  5290	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing
  5291	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tat the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the
  5292	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tliveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with
  5293	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcoming when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw
  5294	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinstantly that her cousin’s manners were not altered by his marriage;
  5295	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this formal civility was just what it had been, and he detained her some
  5296	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tminutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her
  5297	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfamily. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the
  5298	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tneatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they
  5299	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twere in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious
  5300	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tformality to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife’s
  5301	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\toffers of refreshment.
  5302	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5303	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help
  5304	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its
  5305	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taspect and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her,
  5306	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But
  5307	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthough everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to
  5308	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgratify him by any sigh of repentance, and rather looked with wonder at
  5309	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion.
  5310	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWhen Mr. Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be
  5311	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she involuntarily turned her
  5312	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teye on Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but
  5313	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin general Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to
  5314	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tadmire every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to
  5315	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had
  5316	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thappened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the
  5317	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgarden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of
  5318	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhich he attended himself. To work in this garden was one of his most
  5319	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trespectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance
  5320	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and
  5321	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\towned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way
  5322	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthrough every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an
  5323	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinterval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out
  5324	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the
  5325	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in
  5326	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which
  5327	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with the
  5328	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tprospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered
  5329	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a handsome
  5330	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmodern building, well situated on rising ground.
  5331	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5332	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tFrom his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows;
  5333	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbut the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white
  5334	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfrost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte
  5335	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttook her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,
  5336	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tprobably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband’s
  5337	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thelp. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything
  5338	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which
  5339	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be
  5340	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tforgotten, there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and by
  5341	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCharlotte’s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often
  5342	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tforgotten.
  5343	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5344	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It
  5345	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining
  5346	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin, observed:
  5347	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5348	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine
  5349	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tde Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will
  5350	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I
  5351	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdoubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice
  5352	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhen service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she
  5353	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twill include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she
  5354	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thonours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is
  5355	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcharming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed
  5356	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto walk home. Her ladyship’s carriage is regularly ordered for us. I
  5357	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t_should_ say, one of her ladyship’s carriages, for she has several.”
  5358	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5359	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,” added
  5360	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCharlotte, “and a most attentive neighbour.”
  5361	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5362	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of
  5363	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twoman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.”
  5364	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5365	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news,
  5366	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand telling again what had already been written; and when it closed,
  5367	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon
  5368	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCharlotte’s degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,
  5369	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it
  5370	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit
  5371	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twould pass, the quiet tenor of their usual employments, the vexatious
  5372	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinterruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with
  5373	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tRosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.
  5374	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5375	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAbout the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready
  5376	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in
  5377	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconfusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running
  5378	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tup stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened
  5379	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe door and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with
  5380	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tagitation, cried out--
  5381	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5382	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the dining-room, for
  5383	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthere is such a sight to be seen! I will not tell you what it is. Make
  5384	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thaste, and come down this moment.”
  5385	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5386	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more,
  5387	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in
  5388	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tquest of this wonder; It was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the
  5389	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgarden gate.
  5390	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5391	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And is this all?” cried Elizabeth. “I expected at least that the pigs
  5392	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twere got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her
  5393	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdaughter.”
  5394	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5395	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“La! my dear,” said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, “it is not
  5396	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them;
  5397	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little
  5398	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcreature. Who would have thought that she could be so thin and small?”
  5399	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5400	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.
  5401	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWhy does she not come in?”
  5402	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5403	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours
  5404	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhen Miss de Bourgh comes in.”
  5405	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5406	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I like her appearance,” said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. “She
  5407	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlooks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will
  5408	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmake him a very proper wife.”
  5409	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5410	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation
  5411	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth’s high diversion, was
  5412	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tstationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness
  5413	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbefore him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that
  5414	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tway.
  5415	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5416	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAt length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and
  5417	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two
  5418	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgirls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which
  5419	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCharlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked
  5420	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto dine at Rosings the next day.
  5421	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5422	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t

  5424	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tChapter 29
  5425	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5426	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5427	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Collins’s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete.
  5428	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering
  5429	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvisitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his
  5430	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity
  5431	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady
  5432	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCatherine’s condescension, as he knew not how to admire enough.
  5433	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5434	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I confess,” said he, “that I should not have been at all surprised by
  5435	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther ladyship’s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at
  5436	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tRosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that it
  5437	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twould happen. But who could have foreseen such an attention as this? Who
  5438	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcould have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there
  5439	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t(an invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediately
  5440	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tafter your arrival!”
  5441	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5442	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I am the less surprised at what has happened,” replied Sir William,
  5443	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which
  5444	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmy situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such
  5445	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinstances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.”
  5446	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5447	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tScarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their
  5448	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvisit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what
  5449	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthey were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and
  5450	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tso splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.
  5451	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5452	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWhen the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth--
  5453	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5454	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady
  5455	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCatherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which
  5456	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbecomes herself and her daughter. I would advise you merely to put on
  5457	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasion
  5458	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you
  5459	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank
  5460	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpreserved.”
  5461	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5462	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWhile they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different
  5463	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdoors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much
  5464	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tobjected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable accounts of
  5465	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas
  5466	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twho had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her
  5467	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tintroduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done
  5468	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto his presentation at St. James’s.
  5469	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5470	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAs the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a
  5471	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmile across the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and
  5472	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such
  5473	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\traptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but
  5474	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tslightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the
  5475	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thouse, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally
  5476	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.
  5477	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5478	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWhen they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria’s alarm was every
  5479	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmoment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.
  5480	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth’s courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady
  5481	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCatherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or
  5482	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmiraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought
  5483	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe could witness without trepidation.
  5484	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5485	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tFrom the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a
  5486	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments, they
  5487	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfollowed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room where Lady
  5488	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCatherine, her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her ladyship,
  5489	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith great condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had
  5490	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsettled it with her husband that the office of introduction should
  5491	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe hers, it was performed in a proper manner, without any of those
  5492	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tapologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary.
  5493	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5494	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIn spite of having been at St. James’s, Sir William was so completely
  5495	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tawed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage
  5496	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tenough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;
  5497	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge
  5498	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself
  5499	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tquite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her
  5500	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcomposedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked
  5501	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfeatures, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not
  5502	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her
  5503	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvisitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by
  5504	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsilence; but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone,
  5505	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to
  5506	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth’s mind; and from the observation of the day altogether, she
  5507	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbelieved Lady Catherine to be exactly what he represented.
  5508	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5509	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWhen, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment
  5510	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the
  5511	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdaughter, she could almost have joined in Maria’s astonishment at her
  5512	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeing so thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any
  5513	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlikeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her
  5514	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfeatures, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very
  5515	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlittle, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance
  5516	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthere was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening
  5517	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before
  5518	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther eyes.
  5519	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5520	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAfter sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to
  5521	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tadmire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties,
  5522	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth
  5523	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlooking at in the summer.
  5524	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5525	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants and
  5526	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tall the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he had
  5527	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlikewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her
  5528	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tladyship’s desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish
  5529	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnothing greater. He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted
  5530	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\talacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him and then by Sir
  5531	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWilliam, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law
  5532	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsaid, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear.
  5533	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBut Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and
  5534	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved
  5535	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth
  5536	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated
  5537	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbetween Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in
  5538	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlistening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all
  5539	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdinner-time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little
  5540	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMiss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing
  5541	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the
  5542	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.
  5543	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5544	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWhen the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to
  5545	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any
  5546	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tintermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every
  5547	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsubject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she was not used to
  5548	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thave her judgement controverted. She inquired into Charlotte’s domestic
  5549	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconcerns familiarly and minutely, gave her a great deal of advice as
  5550	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be
  5551	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tregulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the
  5552	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcare of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was
  5553	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeneath this great lady’s attention, which could furnish her with an
  5554	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\toccasion of dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse
  5555	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and
  5556	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew
  5557	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe least, and who she observed to Mrs. Collins was a very genteel,
  5558	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpretty kind of girl. She asked her, at different times, how many sisters
  5559	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of
  5560	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthem were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they
  5561	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been
  5562	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther mother’s maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of
  5563	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther questions but answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then
  5564	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tobserved,
  5565	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5566	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Your father’s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For your
  5567	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsake,” turning to Charlotte, “I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no
  5568	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\toccasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought
  5569	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnecessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh’s family. Do you play and sing, Miss
  5570	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBennet?”
  5571	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5572	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“A little.”
  5573	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5574	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh! then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our
  5575	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinstrument is a capital one, probably superior to----You shall try it
  5576	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsome day. Do your sisters play and sing?”
  5577	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5578	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“One of them does.”
  5579	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5580	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The Miss
  5581	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWebbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. Do
  5582	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou draw?”
  5583	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5584	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“No, not at all.”
  5585	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5586	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“What, none of you?”
  5587	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5588	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Not one.”
  5589	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5590	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother
  5591	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshould have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.”
  5592	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5593	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London.”
  5594	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5595	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Has your governess left you?”
  5596	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5597	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“We never had any governess.”
  5598	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5599	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home
  5600	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twithout a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must
  5601	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thave been quite a slave to your education.”
  5602	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5603	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been
  5604	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe case.
  5605	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5606	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you
  5607	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmust have been neglected.”
  5608	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5609	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as
  5610	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to
  5611	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tread, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be
  5612	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tidle, certainly might.”
  5613	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5614	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had
  5615	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tknown your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage
  5616	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tone. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady
  5617	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is
  5618	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that
  5619	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tway. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces
  5620	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and
  5621	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit was but the other day that I recommended another young person,
  5622	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twho was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite
  5623	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdelighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalf’s
  5624	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcalling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. ‘Lady
  5625	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCatherine,’ said she, ‘you have given me a treasure.’ Are any of your
  5626	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyounger sisters out, Miss Bennet?”
  5627	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5628	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes, ma’am, all.”
  5629	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5630	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The
  5631	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyounger ones out before the elder ones are married! Your younger sisters
  5632	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmust be very young?”
  5633	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5634	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to be
  5635	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmuch in company. But really, ma’am, I think it would be very hard upon
  5636	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyounger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and
  5637	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tamusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to
  5638	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmarry early. The last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth
  5639	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas the first. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive! I think it would
  5640	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.”
  5641	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5642	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Upon my word,” said her ladyship, “you give your opinion very decidedly
  5643	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor so young a person. Pray, what is your age?”
  5644	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5645	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“With three younger sisters grown up,” replied Elizabeth, smiling, “your
  5646	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tladyship can hardly expect me to own it.”
  5647	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5648	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;
  5649	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever
  5650	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.
  5651	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5652	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need not

  5654	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5655	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I am not one-and-twenty.”
  5656	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5657	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWhen the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card-tables
  5658	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twere placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat
  5659	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdown to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the
  5660	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttwo girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her
  5661	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tparty. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was
  5662	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tuttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson
  5663	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texpressed her fears of Miss de Bourgh’s being too hot or too cold, or
  5664	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thaving too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the
  5665	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tother table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes
  5666	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins
  5667	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said, thanking her
  5668	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many.
  5669	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tSir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes
  5670	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand noble names.
  5671	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5672	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWhen Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,
  5673	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins,
  5674	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgratefully accepted and immediately ordered. The party then gathered
  5675	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tround the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were
  5676	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by
  5677	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr.
  5678	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCollins’s side and as many bows on Sir William’s they departed. As soon
  5679	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin
  5680	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for
  5681	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCharlotte’s sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But her
  5682	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcommendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy
  5683	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship’s praise
  5684	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinto his own hands.

  5690	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5691	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tSir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was long
  5692	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tenough to convince him of his daughter’s being most comfortably settled,
  5693	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not
  5694	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\toften met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his
  5695	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmorning to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country; but
  5696	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhen he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments,
  5697	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her
  5698	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast
  5699	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in
  5700	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treading and writing, and looking out of the window in his own book-room,
  5701	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhich fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.
  5702	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth had at first rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer
  5703	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a
  5704	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmore pleasant aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent
  5705	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been
  5706	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmuch less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and
  5707	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.
  5708	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5709	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tFrom the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and
  5710	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twere indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went
  5711	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\talong, and how often especially Miss de Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,
  5712	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhich he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened
  5713	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\talmost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and
  5714	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad a few minutes’ conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever
  5715	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tprevailed upon to get out.
  5716	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5717	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tVery few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and
  5718	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;
  5719	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings
  5720	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many
  5721	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship,
  5722	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during
  5723	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthese visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work,
  5724	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement
  5725	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof the furniture; or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she
  5726	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taccepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding
  5727	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tout that Mrs. Collins’s joints of meat were too large for her family.
  5728	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5729	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in
  5730	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcommission of the peace of the county, she was a most active magistrate
  5731	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her
  5732	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tby Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to
  5733	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the
  5734	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvillage to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold
  5735	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthem into harmony and plenty.
  5736	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5737	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;
  5738	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one
  5739	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcard-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart
  5740	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of living
  5741	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin the neighbourhood in general was beyond Mr. Collins’s reach. This,
  5742	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thowever, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time
  5743	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcomfortably enough; there were half-hours of pleasant conversation with
  5744	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCharlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had
  5745	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\toften great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she
  5746	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfrequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was
  5747	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\talong the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was
  5748	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and
  5749	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhere she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine’s curiosity.
  5750	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5751	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIn this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.
  5752	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tEaster was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an
  5753	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taddition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be
  5754	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timportant. Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that Mr. Darcy was
  5755	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texpected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not
  5756	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmany of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer, his coming would
  5757	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfurnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and
  5758	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley’s designs on him
  5759	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twere, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently
  5760	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdestined by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest
  5761	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsatisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and
  5762	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tseemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by
  5763	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMiss Lucas and herself.
  5764	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5765	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHis arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking
  5766	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,
  5767	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin order to have the earliest assurance of it, and after making his
  5768	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great
  5769	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tintelligence. On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his
  5770	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trespects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for
  5771	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of
  5772	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this uncle Lord ----, and, to the great surprise of all the party, when
  5773	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen
  5774	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthem from her husband’s room, crossing the road, and immediately running
  5775	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinto the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding:
  5776	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5777	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would
  5778	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnever have come so soon to wait upon me.”
  5779	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5780	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment,
  5781	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbefore their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly
  5782	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tafterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam,
  5783	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twho led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and
  5784	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taddress most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been
  5785	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tused to look in Hertfordshire--paid his compliments, with his usual
  5786	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treserve, to Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her
  5787	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfriend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely
  5788	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcurtseyed to him without saying a word.
  5789	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5790	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tColonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the
  5791	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treadiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but
  5792	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and
  5793	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgarden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody.
  5794	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAt length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of
  5795	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual
  5796	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tway, and after a moment’s pause, added:
  5797	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5798	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never
  5799	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thappened to see her there?”
  5800	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5801	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see
  5802	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between
  5803	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he looked a little confused as he
  5804	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tanswered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The
  5805	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsubject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went
  5806	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taway.

  5812	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5813	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tColonel Fitzwilliam’s manners were very much admired at the Parsonage,
  5814	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures
  5815	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they
  5816	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treceived any invitation thither--for while there were visitors in the
  5817	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thouse, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,
  5818	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\talmost a week after the gentlemen’s arrival, that they were honoured by
  5819	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuch an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to
  5820	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcome there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little
  5821	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the
  5822	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tParsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had seen
  5823	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tonly at church.
  5824	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5825	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined
  5826	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe party in Lady Catherine’s drawing-room. Her ladyship received
  5827	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthem civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so
  5828	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tacceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,
  5829	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\talmost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,
  5830	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmuch more than to any other person in the room.
  5831	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5832	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tColonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was a
  5833	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twelcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins’s pretty friend had
  5834	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmoreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and
  5835	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttalked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying
  5836	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tat home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so
  5837	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twell entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much
  5838	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tspirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself,
  5839	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas well as of Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned
  5840	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttowards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship, after a
  5841	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhile, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not
  5842	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tscruple to call out:
  5843	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5844	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking
  5845	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is.”
  5846	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5847	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“We are speaking of music, madam,” said he, when no longer able to avoid
  5848	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta reply.
  5849	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5850	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I
  5851	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmust have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music.
  5852	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThere are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment
  5853	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt,
  5854	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her health
  5855	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have performed
  5856	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdelightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?”
  5857	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5858	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister’s proficiency.
  5859	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5860	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,” said Lady
  5861	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCatherine; “and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel
  5862	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tif she does not practice a good deal.”
  5863	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5864	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I assure you, madam,” he replied, “that she does not need such advice.
  5865	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe practises very constantly.”
  5866	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5867	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write
  5868	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often
  5869	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without
  5870	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconstant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she
  5871	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twill never play really well unless she practises more; and though Mrs.
  5872	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCollins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told
  5873	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs.
  5874	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tJenkinson’s room. She would be in nobody’s way, you know, in that part
  5875	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof the house.”
  5876	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5877	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt’s ill-breeding, and made
  5878	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tno answer.
  5879	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5880	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWhen coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having
  5881	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpromised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He
  5882	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdrew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then
  5883	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttalked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away
  5884	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfrom her, and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte
  5885	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tstationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer’s
  5886	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcountenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first
  5887	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconvenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said:
  5888	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5889	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear
  5890	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tme? I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well. There
  5891	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tis a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the
  5892	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twill of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate
  5893	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tme.”
  5894	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5895	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I shall not say you are mistaken,” he replied, “because you could not
  5896	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treally believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have
  5897	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find
  5898	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgreat enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are
  5899	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot your own.”
  5900	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5901	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to
  5902	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tColonel Fitzwilliam, “Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of
  5903	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tme, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky
  5904	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin meeting with a person so able to expose my real character, in a part
  5905	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of
  5906	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcredit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all
  5907	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me leave to
  5908	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsay, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such
  5909	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthings may come out as will shock your relations to hear.”
  5910	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5911	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I am not afraid of you,” said he, smilingly.
  5912	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5913	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,” cried Colonel
  5914	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tFitzwilliam. “I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.”
  5915	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5916	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful.
  5917	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know,
  5918	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas at a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced
  5919	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tonly four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain
  5920	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tknowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a
  5921	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpartner. Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact.”
  5922	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5923	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly
  5924	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeyond my own party.”
  5925	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5926	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well, Colonel
  5927	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tFitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders.”
  5928	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5929	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Perhaps,” said Darcy, “I should have judged better, had I sought an
  5930	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tintroduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.”
  5931	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5932	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?” said Elizabeth, still
  5933	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taddressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. “Shall we ask him why a man of sense and
  5934	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teducation, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend
  5935	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thimself to strangers?”
  5936	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5937	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I can answer your question,” said Fitzwilliam, “without applying to
  5938	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim. It is because he will not give himself the trouble.”
  5939	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5940	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,” said Darcy,
  5941	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot
  5942	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcatch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their
  5943	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconcerns, as I often see done.”
  5944	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5945	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“My fingers,” said Elizabeth, “do not move over this instrument in the
  5946	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmasterly manner which I see so many women’s do. They have not the same
  5947	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tforce or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I
  5948	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thave always supposed it to be my own fault--because I will not take the
  5949	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttrouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as
  5950	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcapable as any other woman’s of superior execution.”
  5951	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5952	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tDarcy smiled and said, “You are perfectly right. You have employed your
  5953	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttime much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can
  5954	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthink anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers.”
  5955	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5956	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHere they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know
  5957	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhat they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again.
  5958	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said
  5959	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto Darcy:
  5960	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5961	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and
  5962	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcould have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion
  5963	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne’s. Anne would have
  5964	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeen a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.”
  5965	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5966	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his
  5967	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcousin’s praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she
  5968	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdiscern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss
  5969	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tde Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have
  5970	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeen just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.
  5971	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5972	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth’s performance, mixing
  5973	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith them many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth received
  5974	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthem with all the forbearance of civility, and, at the request of the
  5975	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgentlemen, remained at the instrument till her ladyship’s carriage was
  5976	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tready to take them all home.
  5977	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t

  5981	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5982	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5983	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane
  5984	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhile Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village,
  5985	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhen she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a
  5986	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvisitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to
  5987	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her
  5988	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thalf-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions,
  5989	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhen the door opened, and, to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and
  5990	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Darcy only, entered the room.
  5991	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5992	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHe seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his
  5993	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tintrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies were
  5994	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto be within.
  5995	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  5996	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThey then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made,
  5997	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tseemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely
  5998	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnecessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence
  5999	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trecollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and
  6000	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfeeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty
  6001	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdeparture, she observed:
  6002	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6003	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy!
  6004	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIt must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you
  6005	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tall after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day
  6006	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbefore. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?”
  6007	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6008	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Perfectly so, I thank you.”
  6009	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6010	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe found that she was to receive no other answer, and, after a short
  6011	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpause added:
  6012	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6013	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever
  6014	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treturning to Netherfield again?”
  6015	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6016	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend
  6017	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvery little of his time there in the future. He has many friends, and
  6018	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tis at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually
  6019	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tincreasing.”
  6020	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6021	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for
  6022	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we
  6023	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmight possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did
  6024	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as
  6025	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor his own, and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same
  6026	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tprinciple.”
  6027	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6028	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I should not be surprised,” said Darcy, “if he were to give it up as
  6029	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsoon as any eligible purchase offers.”
  6030	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6031	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his
  6032	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfriend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the
  6033	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttrouble of finding a subject to him.
  6034	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6035	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHe took the hint, and soon began with, “This seems a very comfortable
  6036	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thouse. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.
  6037	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCollins first came to Hunsford.”
  6038	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6039	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her
  6040	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tkindness on a more grateful object.”
  6041	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6042	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife.”
  6043	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6044	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one
  6045	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made
  6046	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding--though
  6047	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the
  6048	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twisest thing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a
  6049	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tprudential light it is certainly a very good match for her.”
  6050	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6051	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“It must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a
  6052	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdistance of her own family and friends.”
  6053	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6054	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“An easy distance, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.”
  6055	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6056	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day’s
  6057	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tjourney. Yes, I call it a _very_ easy distance.”
  6058	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6059	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_
  6060	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof the match,” cried Elizabeth. “I should never have said Mrs. Collins
  6061	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas settled _near_ her family.”
  6062	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6063	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond
  6064	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.”
  6065	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6066	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAs he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she
  6067	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunderstood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and
  6068	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tNetherfield, and she blushed as she answered:
  6069	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6070	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her
  6071	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfamily. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many
  6072	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvarying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expenses of
  6073	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttravelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the
  6074	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcase _here_. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not
  6075	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuch a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my
  6076	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfriend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_
  6077	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe present distance.”
  6078	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6079	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, “_You_ cannot
  6080	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thave a right to such very strong local attachment. _You_ cannot have
  6081	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeen always at Longbourn.”
  6082	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6083	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of
  6084	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfeeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and
  6085	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tglancing over it, said, in a colder voice:
  6086	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6087	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Are you pleased with Kent?”
  6088	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6089	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tA short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side
  6090	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcalm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte
  6091	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand her sister, just returned from her walk. The tete-a-tete surprised
  6092	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthem. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding
  6093	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ton Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying
  6094	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmuch to anybody, went away.
  6095	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6096	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“What can be the meaning of this?” said Charlotte, as soon as he was
  6097	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgone. “My dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never
  6098	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thave called us in this familiar way.”
  6099	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6100	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBut when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,
  6101	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teven to Charlotte’s wishes, to be the case; and after various
  6102	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from
  6103	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable
  6104	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfrom the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there
  6105	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot
  6106	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\talways be within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the
  6107	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the
  6108	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttwo cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither
  6109	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\talmost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes
  6110	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tseparately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their
  6111	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he
  6112	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended
  6113	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in
  6114	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeing with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her
  6115	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tformer favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw
  6116	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthere was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam’s manners,
  6117	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe believed he might have the best informed mind.
  6118	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6119	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBut why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult
  6120	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there
  6121	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak,
  6122	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice
  6123	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really
  6124	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tanimated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel
  6125	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tFitzwilliam’s occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was
  6126	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgenerally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told
  6127	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther; and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect
  6128	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself
  6129	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tseriously to work to find it out. She watched him whenever they were at
  6130	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tRosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He
  6131	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcertainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that
  6132	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlook was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often
  6133	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdoubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it
  6134	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tseemed nothing but absence of mind.
  6135	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6136	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his
  6137	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeing partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.
  6138	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCollins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of
  6139	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\traising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her
  6140	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\topinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend’s dislike would
  6141	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.
  6142	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6143	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6144	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIn her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying
  6145	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tColonel Fitzwilliam. He was beyond comparison the most pleasant man; he
  6146	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcertainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,
  6147	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage
  6148	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin the church, and his cousin could have none at all.

  6154	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6155	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMore than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,
  6156	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the
  6157	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmischance that should bring him where no one else was brought, and, to
  6158	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tprevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him at first that
  6159	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time,
  6160	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttherefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even a third. It seemed like
  6161	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance, for on these occasions it was
  6162	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away,
  6163	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbut he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He
  6164	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnever said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking
  6165	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tor of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third
  6166	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about
  6167	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her
  6168	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\topinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins’s happiness; and that in speaking of
  6169	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tRosings and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to
  6170	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texpect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying
  6171	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t_there_ too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel
  6172	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tFitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must
  6173	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed
  6174	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the
  6175	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpales opposite the Parsonage.
  6176	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6177	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Jane’s last letter,
  6178	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in
  6179	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tspirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw
  6180	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ton looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting away the
  6181	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tletter immediately and forcing a smile, she said:
  6182	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6183	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I did not know before that you ever walked this way.”
  6184	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6185	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I have been making the tour of the park,” he replied, “as I generally
  6186	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdo every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage. Are
  6187	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou going much farther?”
  6188	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6189	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“No, I should have turned in a moment.”
  6190	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6191	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAnd accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage
  6192	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttogether.
  6193	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6194	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?” said she.
  6195	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6196	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He
  6197	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tarranges the business just as he pleases.”
  6198	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6199	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least
  6200	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpleasure in the great power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems
  6201	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmore to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.”
  6202	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6203	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“He likes to have his own way very well,” replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.
  6204	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it
  6205	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthan many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak
  6206	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfeelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and
  6207	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdependence.”
  6208	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6209	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of
  6210	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teither. Now seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and
  6211	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going
  6212	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a fancy for?”
  6213	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6214	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have
  6215	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texperienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater
  6216	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tweight, I may suffer from want of money. Younger sons cannot marry where
  6217	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthey like.”
  6218	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6219	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often
  6220	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdo.”
  6221	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6222	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many
  6223	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to
  6224	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmoney.”
  6225	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6226	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Is this,” thought Elizabeth, “meant for me?” and she coloured at the
  6227	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tidea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, “And pray, what
  6228	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tis the usual price of an earl’s younger son? Unless the elder brother is
  6229	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvery sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.”
  6230	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6231	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHe answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt
  6232	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,
  6233	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe soon afterwards said:
  6234	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6235	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of
  6236	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thaving someone at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a
  6237	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as well
  6238	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he
  6239	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlikes with her.”
  6240	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6241	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“No,” said Colonel Fitzwilliam, “that is an advantage which he must
  6242	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdivide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.”
  6243	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6244	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Are you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your
  6245	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcharge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes a
  6246	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlittle difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she
  6247	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmay like to have her own way.”
  6248	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6249	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAs she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner
  6250	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to
  6251	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgive them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other
  6252	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgot pretty near the truth. She directly replied:
  6253	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6254	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare
  6255	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsay she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a
  6256	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvery great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and
  6257	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMiss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.”
  6258	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6259	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man--he
  6260	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tis a great friend of Darcy’s.”
  6261	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6262	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh! yes,” said Elizabeth drily; “Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.
  6263	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.”
  6264	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6265	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in
  6266	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthose points where he most wants care. From something that he told me in
  6267	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tour journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to
  6268	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that
  6269	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.”
  6270	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6271	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“What is it you mean?”
  6272	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6273	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally known,
  6274	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbecause if it were to get round to the lady’s family, it would be an
  6275	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunpleasant thing.”
  6276	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6277	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You may depend upon my not mentioning it.”
  6278	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6279	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be
  6280	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself
  6281	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ton having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most
  6282	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other
  6283	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tparticulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing
  6284	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from
  6285	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tknowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.”
  6286	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6287	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?”
  6288	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6289	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I understood that there were some very strong objections against the
  6290	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlady.”
  6291	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6292	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And what arts did he use to separate them?”
  6293	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6294	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“He did not talk to me of his own arts,” said Fitzwilliam, smiling. “He
  6295	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tonly told me what I have now told you.”
  6296	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6297	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with
  6298	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tindignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she
  6299	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas so thoughtful.
  6300	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6301	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I am thinking of what you have been telling me,” said she. “Your
  6302	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcousin’s conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the judge?”
  6303	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6304	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?”
  6305	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6306	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his
  6307	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfriend’s inclination, or why, upon his own judgement alone, he was to
  6308	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdetermine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy.
  6309	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBut,” she continued, recollecting herself, “as we know none of the
  6310	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tparticulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed
  6311	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat there was much affection in the case.”
  6312	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6313	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“That is not an unnatural surmise,” said Fitzwilliam, “but it is a
  6314	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlessening of the honour of my cousin’s triumph very sadly.”
  6315	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6316	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThis was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her so just a picture
  6317	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer, and
  6318	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttherefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent
  6319	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmatters until they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own room,
  6320	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption
  6321	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other
  6322	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpeople could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There
  6323	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcould not exist in the world _two_ men over whom Mr. Darcy could have
  6324	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuch boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures
  6325	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttaken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she had
  6326	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\talways attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement
  6327	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, _he_ was
  6328	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe cause, his pride and caprice were the cause, of all that Jane had
  6329	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a while
  6330	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tevery hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the
  6331	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tworld; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.
  6332	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6333	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“There were some very strong objections against the lady,” were Colonel
  6334	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tFitzwilliam’s words; and those strong objections probably were, her
  6335	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thaving one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in
  6336	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbusiness in London.
  6337	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6338	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“To Jane herself,” she exclaimed, “there could be no possibility of
  6339	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tobjection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!--her understanding
  6340	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texcellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither
  6341	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcould anything be urged against my father, who, though with some
  6342	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpeculiarities, has abilities Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and
  6343	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trespectability which he will probably never reach.” When she thought of
  6344	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther mother, her confidence gave way a little; but she would not allow
  6345	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose
  6346	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of
  6347	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timportance in his friend’s connections, than from their want of sense;
  6348	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly governed
  6349	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tby this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr.
  6350	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBingley for his sister.
  6351	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6352	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on a
  6353	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\theadache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening, that, added to
  6354	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her
  6355	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins,
  6356	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tseeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go and as much
  6357	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collins
  6358	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcould not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine’s being rather
  6359	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdispleased by her staying at home.
  6360	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t

  6364	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6365	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6366	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWhen they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself
  6367	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the
  6368	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texamination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her
  6369	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeing in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any
  6370	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trevival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.
  6371	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBut in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that
  6372	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style, and which,
  6373	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tproceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly
  6374	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdisposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth
  6375	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnoticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an
  6376	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tattention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy’s
  6377	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict, gave her
  6378	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta keener sense of her sister’s sufferings. It was some consolation
  6379	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the
  6380	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnext--and, a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should
  6381	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\therself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of
  6382	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther spirits, by all that affection could do.
  6383	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6384	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe could not think of Darcy’s leaving Kent without remembering that
  6385	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear
  6386	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not
  6387	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmean to be unhappy about him.
  6388	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6389	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWhile settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the
  6390	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdoor-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its
  6391	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeing Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in
  6392	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her.
  6393	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBut this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently
  6394	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taffected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the
  6395	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\troom. In an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her
  6396	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thealth, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.
  6397	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and
  6398	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthen getting up, walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but
  6399	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsaid not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her
  6400	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin an agitated manner, and thus began:
  6401	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6402	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be
  6403	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trepressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love
  6404	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou.”
  6405	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6406	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth’s astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured,
  6407	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdoubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement;
  6408	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand the avowal of all that he felt, and had long felt for her,
  6409	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timmediately followed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besides
  6410	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthose of the heart to be detailed; and he was not more eloquent on the
  6411	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsubject of tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority--of
  6412	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tits being a degradation--of the family obstacles which had always
  6413	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\topposed to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to
  6414	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his
  6415	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuit.
  6416	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6417	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIn spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to
  6418	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe compliment of such a man’s affection, and though her intentions did
  6419	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to
  6420	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treceive; till, roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she
  6421	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlost all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to
  6422	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tanswer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with
  6423	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trepresenting to her the strength of that attachment which, in spite
  6424	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof all his endeavours, he had found impossible to conquer; and with
  6425	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texpressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of
  6426	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this hand. As he said this, she could easily see that he had no doubt
  6427	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof a favourable answer. He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but
  6428	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could
  6429	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tonly exasperate farther, and, when he ceased, the colour rose into her
  6430	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcheeks, and she said:
  6431	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6432	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to
  6433	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texpress a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however
  6434	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should
  6435	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you. But I
  6436	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly
  6437	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to
  6438	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tanyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be
  6439	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof short duration. The feelings which, you tell me, have long prevented
  6440	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe acknowledgment of your regard, can have little difficulty in
  6441	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tovercoming it after this explanation.”
  6442	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6443	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed
  6444	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ton her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than
  6445	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsurprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance
  6446	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the
  6447	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tappearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed
  6448	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thimself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth’s feelings
  6449	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdreadful. At length, with a voice of forced calmness, he said:
  6450	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6451	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting!
  6452	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at
  6453	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcivility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.”
  6454	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6455	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I might as well inquire,” replied she, “why with so evident a desire
  6456	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me
  6457	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tagainst your will, against your reason, and even against your character?
  6458	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWas not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil? But I have
  6459	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tother provocations. You know I have. Had not my feelings decided against
  6460	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou--had they been indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you
  6461	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthink that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has
  6462	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeen the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most
  6463	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeloved sister?”
  6464	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6465	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAs she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion
  6466	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she
  6467	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcontinued:
  6468	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6469	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can
  6470	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texcuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You dare not,
  6471	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if not the only means
  6472	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof dividing them from each other--of exposing one to the censure of the
  6473	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tworld for caprice and instability, and the other to its derision for
  6474	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdisappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest
  6475	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tkind.”
  6476	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6477	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening
  6478	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.
  6479	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHe even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.
  6480	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6481	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Can you deny that you have done it?” she repeated.
  6482	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6483	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWith assumed tranquillity he then replied: “I have no wish of denying
  6484	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your
  6485	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_ I have been
  6486	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tkinder than towards myself.”
  6487	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6488	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,
  6489	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbut its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.
  6490	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6491	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“But it is not merely this affair,” she continued, “on which my dislike
  6492	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tis founded. Long before it had taken place my opinion of you was
  6493	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdecided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received
  6494	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmany months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to
  6495	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsay? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?
  6496	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tor under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?”
  6497	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6498	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You take an eager interest in that gentleman’s concerns,” said Darcy,
  6499	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.
  6500	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6501	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an
  6502	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinterest in him?”
  6503	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6504	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“His misfortunes!” repeated Darcy contemptuously; “yes, his misfortunes
  6505	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thave been great indeed.”
  6506	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6507	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And of your infliction,” cried Elizabeth with energy. “You have reduced
  6508	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim to his present state of poverty--comparative poverty. You have
  6509	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twithheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for
  6510	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim. You have deprived the best years of his life of that independence
  6511	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhich was no less his due than his desert. You have done all this!
  6512	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and
  6513	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tridicule.”
  6514	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6515	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And this,” cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,
  6516	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me!
  6517	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this
  6518	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcalculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps,” added he, stopping in
  6519	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this walk, and turning towards her, “these offenses might have been
  6520	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\toverlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the
  6521	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tscruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These
  6522	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater
  6523	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpolicy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of
  6524	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmy being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by
  6525	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.
  6526	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tNor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and
  6527	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tjust. Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your
  6528	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconnections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations, whose
  6529	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcondition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?”
  6530	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6531	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to
  6532	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe utmost to speak with composure when she said:
  6533	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6534	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your
  6535	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdeclaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern
  6536	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhich I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more
  6537	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgentlemanlike manner.”
  6538	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6539	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued:
  6540	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6541	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible way that
  6542	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twould have tempted me to accept it.”
  6543	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6544	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAgain his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an
  6545	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texpression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on:
  6546	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6547	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“From the very beginning--from the first moment, I may almost say--of
  6548	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmy acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with the fullest
  6549	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbelief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of
  6550	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe feelings of others, were such as to form the groundwork of
  6551	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdisapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a
  6552	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the
  6553	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlast man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.”
  6554	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6555	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your
  6556	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfeelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.
  6557	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tForgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best
  6558	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twishes for your health and happiness.”
  6559	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6560	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAnd with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him
  6561	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe next moment open the front door and quit the house.
  6562	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6563	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe tumult of her mind, was now painfully great. She knew not how
  6564	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried for
  6565	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thalf-an-hour. Her astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed,
  6566	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas increased by every review of it. That she should receive an offer of
  6567	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmarriage from Mr. Darcy! That he should have been in love with her for
  6568	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tso many months! So much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of
  6569	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tall the objections which had made him prevent his friend’s marrying
  6570	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther sister, and which must appear at least with equal force in his
  6571	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\town case--was almost incredible! It was gratifying to have inspired
  6572	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunconsciously so strong an affection. But his pride, his abominable
  6573	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpride--his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to
  6574	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tJane--his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he could
  6575	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr.
  6576	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny, soon
  6577	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tovercame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for
  6578	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta moment excited. She continued in very agitated reflections till the
  6579	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsound of Lady Catherine’s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to
  6580	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tencounter Charlotte’s observation, and hurried her away to her room.
  6581	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6582	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6583	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6584	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tChapter 35
  6585	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6586	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6587	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations
  6588	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhich had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the
  6589	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsurprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of anything
  6590	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\telse; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved, soon after
  6591	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbreakfast, to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding
  6592	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdirectly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy’s
  6593	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,
  6594	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road. The
  6595	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpark paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one
  6596	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof the gates into the ground.
  6597	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6598	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAfter walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was
  6599	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and
  6600	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlook into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had
  6601	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmade a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the
  6602	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tverdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk,
  6603	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhen she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which
  6604	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tedged the park; he was moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr.
  6605	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tDarcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was now
  6606	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnear enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced
  6607	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself called, though
  6608	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the
  6609	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgate. He had by that time reached it also, and, holding out a letter,
  6610	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhich she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty composure,
  6611	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you.
  6612	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWill you do me the honour of reading that letter?” And then, with a
  6613	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tslight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.
  6614	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6615	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWith no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,
  6616	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder,
  6617	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tperceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper, written
  6618	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tquite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise
  6619	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfull. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated
  6620	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfrom Rosings, at eight o’clock in the morning, and was as follows:--
  6621	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6622	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension
  6623	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those
  6624	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\toffers which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any
  6625	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tintention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes
  6626	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhich, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the
  6627	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teffort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion,
  6628	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshould have been spared, had not my character required it to be written
  6629	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand
  6630	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyour attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I
  6631	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdemand it of your justice.
  6632	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6633	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of equal
  6634	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmagnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was,
  6635	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley
  6636	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfrom your sister, and the other, that I had, in defiance of various
  6637	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tclaims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate
  6638	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tprosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and
  6639	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged
  6640	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfavourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other
  6641	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect
  6642	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tits exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young
  6643	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpersons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could
  6644	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last
  6645	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnight so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope
  6646	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto be in the future secured, when the following account of my actions
  6647	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them, which
  6648	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tis due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which
  6649	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmay be offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity
  6650	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmust be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.
  6651	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6652	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with
  6653	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tothers, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young
  6654	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twoman in the country. But it was not till the evening of the dance
  6655	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tat Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious
  6656	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tattachment. I had often seen him in love before. At that ball, while I
  6657	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir
  6658	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWilliam Lucas’s accidental information, that Bingley’s attentions to
  6659	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyour sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage.
  6660	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHe spoke of it as a certain event, of which the time alone could
  6661	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe undecided. From that moment I observed my friend’s behaviour
  6662	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tattentively; and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss
  6663	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him. Your sister I also
  6664	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twatched. Her look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging as ever,
  6665	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbut without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I remained convinced
  6666	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfrom the evening’s scrutiny, that though she received his attentions
  6667	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith pleasure, she did not invite them by any participation of
  6668	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken here, _I_ must have been
  6669	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin error. Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter
  6670	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tprobable. If it be so, if I have been misled by such error to inflict
  6671	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpain on her, your resentment has not been unreasonable. But I shall not
  6672	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tscruple to assert, that the serenity of your sister’s countenance and
  6673	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tair was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction
  6674	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat, however amiable her temper, her heart was not likely to be
  6675	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teasily touched. That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is
  6676	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcertain--but I will venture to say that my investigation and decisions
  6677	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tare not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did not believe
  6678	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed it on impartial
  6679	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My objections to the
  6680	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmarriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have
  6681	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe utmost force of passion to put aside, in my own case; the want of
  6682	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconnection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me. But
  6683	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthere were other causes of repugnance; causes which, though still
  6684	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texisting, and existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had
  6685	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmyself endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before
  6686	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tme. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The situation of your
  6687	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmother’s family, though objectionable, was nothing in comparison to that
  6688	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttotal want of propriety so frequently, so almost uniformly betrayed by
  6689	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\therself, by your three younger sisters, and occasionally even by your
  6690	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfather. Pardon me. It pains me to offend you. But amidst your concern
  6691	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor the defects of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this
  6692	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trepresentation of them, let it give you consolation to consider that, to
  6693	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thave conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure,
  6694	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tis praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister, than
  6695	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit is honourable to the sense and disposition of both. I will only say
  6696	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfarther that from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties
  6697	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas confirmed, and every inducement heightened which could have led
  6698	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tme before, to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy
  6699	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconnection. He left Netherfield for London, on the day following, as
  6700	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon returning.
  6701	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6702	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“The part which I acted is now to be explained. His sisters’ uneasiness
  6703	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad been equally excited with my own; our coincidence of feeling was
  6704	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsoon discovered, and, alike sensible that no time was to be lost in
  6705	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdetaching their brother, we shortly resolved on joining him directly in
  6706	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLondon. We accordingly went--and there I readily engaged in the office
  6707	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice. I
  6708	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdescribed, and enforced them earnestly. But, however this remonstrance
  6709	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmight have staggered or delayed his determination, I do not suppose
  6710	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat it would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been
  6711	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tseconded by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your
  6712	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsister’s indifference. He had before believed her to return his
  6713	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taffection with sincere, if not with equal regard. But Bingley has great
  6714	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnatural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his
  6715	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\town. To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was
  6716	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tno very difficult point. To persuade him against returning into
  6717	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the
  6718	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twork of a moment. I cannot blame myself for having done thus much. There
  6719	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tis but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which I do not
  6720	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the
  6721	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmeasures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister’s being in
  6722	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttown. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her
  6723	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbrother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might have met without
  6724	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\till consequence is perhaps probable; but his regard did not appear to me
  6725	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tenough extinguished for him to see her without some danger. Perhaps this
  6726	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconcealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however, and it
  6727	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas done for the best. On this subject I have nothing more to say, no
  6728	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tother apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister’s feelings, it
  6729	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to
  6730	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn
  6731	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthem.
  6732	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6733	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having injured
  6734	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his
  6735	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconnection with my family. Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I
  6736	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tam ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more
  6737	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthan one witness of undoubted veracity.
  6738	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6739	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many
  6740	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyears the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good
  6741	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to
  6742	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe of service to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his
  6743	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tkindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at
  6744	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tschool, and afterwards at Cambridge--most important assistance, as his
  6745	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\town father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have
  6746	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeen unable to give him a gentleman’s education. My father was not only
  6747	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfond of this young man’s society, whose manners were always engaging; he
  6748	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be
  6749	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this profession, intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is
  6750	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmany, many years since I first began to think of him in a very different
  6751	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmanner. The vicious propensities--the want of principle, which he was
  6752	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcareful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape
  6753	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself,
  6754	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr.
  6755	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tDarcy could not have. Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree
  6756	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham
  6757	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thas created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from
  6758	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunfolding his real character--it adds even another motive.
  6759	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6760	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“My excellent father died about five years ago; and his attachment to
  6761	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his will he particularly
  6762	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trecommended it to me, to promote his advancement in the best manner
  6763	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat his profession might allow--and if he took orders, desired that a
  6764	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvaluable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant. There
  6765	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas also a legacy of one thousand pounds. His own father did not long
  6766	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsurvive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr. Wickham
  6767	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against taking orders,
  6768	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\the hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more
  6769	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timmediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he
  6770	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcould not be benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying
  6771	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlaw, and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would
  6772	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe a very insufficient support therein. I rather wished, than believed
  6773	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim to be sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to
  6774	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman; the
  6775	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbusiness was therefore soon settled--he resigned all claim to assistance
  6776	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to
  6777	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treceive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection
  6778	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbetween us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him
  6779	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town I believe he chiefly
  6780	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free
  6781	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfrom all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and dissipation.
  6782	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tFor about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the
  6783	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tincumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to
  6784	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tme again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he assured
  6785	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tme, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad. He
  6786	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely
  6787	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tresolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in
  6788	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tquestion--of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was
  6789	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twell assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not
  6790	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thave forgotten my revered father’s intentions. You will hardly blame
  6791	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tme for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every
  6792	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trepetition to it. His resentment was in proportion to the distress of
  6793	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me
  6794	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto others as in his reproaches to myself. After this period every
  6795	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tappearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived I know not. But
  6796	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlast summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.
  6797	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6798	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself,
  6799	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold
  6800	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your
  6801	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsecrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to
  6802	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe guardianship of my mother’s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself.
  6803	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAbout a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed
  6804	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor her in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided
  6805	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tover it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by
  6806	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdesign; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him
  6807	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and
  6808	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tby her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana,
  6809	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to
  6810	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and
  6811	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto consent to an elopement. She was then but fifteen, which must be her
  6812	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texcuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed
  6813	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two
  6814	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbefore the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the
  6815	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tidea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as
  6816	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and
  6817	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thow I acted. Regard for my sister’s credit and feelings prevented
  6818	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tany public exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place
  6819	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timmediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr.
  6820	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWickham’s chief object was unquestionably my sister’s fortune, which
  6821	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tis thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of
  6822	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trevenging himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have
  6823	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeen complete indeed.
  6824	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6825	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have
  6826	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeen concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as
  6827	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfalse, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr.
  6828	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood he
  6829	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered
  6830	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tat. Ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either,
  6831	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdetection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in
  6832	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyour inclination.
  6833	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6834	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night; but
  6835	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to
  6836	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe revealed. For the truth of everything here related, I can appeal more
  6837	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tparticularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our
  6838	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnear relationship and constant intimacy, and, still more, as one of
  6839	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe executors of my father’s will, has been unavoidably acquainted
  6840	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith every particular of these transactions. If your abhorrence of _me_
  6841	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshould make _my_ assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by
  6842	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe same cause from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be
  6843	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour to find some
  6844	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\topportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the
  6845	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmorning. I will only add, God bless you.

  6854	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIf Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to
  6855	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcontain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of
  6856	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tits contents. But such as they were, it may well be supposed how eagerly
  6857	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.
  6858	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHer feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did
  6859	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;
  6860	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation
  6861	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong
  6862	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tprejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of what
  6863	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad happened at Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which hardly
  6864	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tleft her power of comprehension, and from impatience of knowing what the
  6865	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnext sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the sense of
  6866	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe one before her eyes. His belief of her sister’s insensibility she
  6867	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinstantly resolved to be false; and his account of the real, the worst
  6868	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tobjections to the match, made her too angry to have any wish of doing
  6869	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied
  6870	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all pride and
  6871	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinsolence.
  6872	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6873	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBut when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham--when
  6874	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which,
  6875	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tif true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which
  6876	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself--her
  6877	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfeelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.
  6878	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAstonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished
  6879	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, “This must be false!
  6880	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThis cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!”--and when she had
  6881	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the
  6882	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlast page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not
  6883	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tregard it, that she would never look in it again.
  6884	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6885	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIn this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on
  6886	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnothing, she walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the letter
  6887	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she could, she
  6888	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tagain began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and
  6889	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcommanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.
  6890	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what
  6891	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\the had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though
  6892	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own
  6893	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twords. So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the
  6894	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twill, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living
  6895	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was
  6896	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timpossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the
  6897	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tother; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did
  6898	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot err. But when she read and re-read with the closest attention, the
  6899	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tparticulars immediately following of Wickham’s resigning all pretensions
  6900	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three
  6901	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down
  6902	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be
  6903	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timpartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with
  6904	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlittle success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read
  6905	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ton; but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had
  6906	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbelieved it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to
  6907	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trender Mr. Darcy’s conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a
  6908	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tturn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.
  6909	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6910	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at
  6911	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Wickham’s charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could
  6912	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his
  6913	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tentrance into the ----shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the
  6914	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpersuasion of the young man who, on meeting him accidentally in town,
  6915	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life
  6916	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As
  6917	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto his real character, had information been in her power, she had
  6918	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnever felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner had
  6919	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\testablished him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried
  6920	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of
  6921	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tintegrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of
  6922	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those
  6923	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcasual errors under which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy
  6924	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad described as the idleness and vice of many years’ continuance. But
  6925	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tno such recollection befriended her. She could see him instantly before
  6926	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more
  6927	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsubstantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and
  6928	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After
  6929	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to
  6930	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tread. But, alas! the story which followed, of his designs on Miss
  6931	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tDarcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel
  6932	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tFitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was
  6933	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treferred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam
  6934	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thimself--from whom she had previously received the information of his
  6935	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnear concern in all his cousin’s affairs, and whose character she had no
  6936	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on applying to
  6937	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and
  6938	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tat length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never
  6939	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thave hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his
  6940	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcousin’s corroboration.
  6941	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6942	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation
  6943	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbetween Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Phillips’s.
  6944	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMany of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was _now_
  6945	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tstruck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and
  6946	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting
  6947	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thimself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions
  6948	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear
  6949	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that
  6950	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball
  6951	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe very next week. She remembered also that, till the Netherfield
  6952	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfamily had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but
  6953	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\therself; but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed;
  6954	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy’s
  6955	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcharacter, though he had assured her that respect for the father would
  6956	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\talways prevent his exposing the son.
  6957	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6958	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHow differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned!
  6959	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHis attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and
  6960	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer
  6961	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.
  6962	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHis behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had
  6963	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teither been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying
  6964	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most
  6965	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tincautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter
  6966	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not
  6967	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbut allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago
  6968	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tasserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as
  6969	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twere his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their
  6970	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tacquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much
  6971	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttogether, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anything
  6972	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him
  6973	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof irreligious or immoral habits; that among his own connections he was
  6974	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\testeemed and valued--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a
  6975	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbrother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his
  6976	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsister as to prove him capable of _some_ amiable feeling; that had his
  6977	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tactions been what Mr. Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of
  6978	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teverything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and
  6979	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man
  6980	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.
  6981	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6982	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor Wickham
  6983	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcould she think without feeling she had been blind, partial, prejudiced,
  6984	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tabsurd.
  6985	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6986	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“How despicably I have acted!” she cried; “I, who have prided myself
  6987	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ton my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have
  6988	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\toften disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified
  6989	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmy vanity in useless or blameable mistrust! How humiliating is this
  6990	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdiscovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could
  6991	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot have been more wretchedly blind! But vanity, not love, has been my
  6992	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfolly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect
  6993	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted
  6994	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tprepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either were
  6995	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconcerned. Till this moment I never knew myself.”
  6996	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  6997	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tFrom herself to Jane--from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line
  6998	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhich soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy’s explanation
  6999	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t_there_ had appeared very insufficient, and she read it again. Widely
  7000	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdifferent was the effect of a second perusal. How could she deny that
  7001	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcredit to his assertions in one instance, which she had been obliged to
  7002	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgive in the other? He declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her
  7003	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsister’s attachment; and she could not help remembering what Charlotte’s
  7004	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\topinion had always been. Neither could she deny the justice of his
  7005	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdescription of Jane. She felt that Jane’s feelings, though fervent, were
  7006	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlittle displayed, and that there was a constant complacency in her air
  7007	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand manner not often united with great sensibility.
  7008	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7009	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWhen she came to that part of the letter in which her family were
  7010	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense
  7011	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly
  7012	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as
  7013	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thaving passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first
  7014	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdisapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind
  7015	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthan on hers.
  7016	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7017	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It soothed,
  7018	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbut it could not console her for the contempt which had thus been
  7019	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tself-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered
  7020	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat Jane’s disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest
  7021	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trelations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt
  7022	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tby such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she
  7023	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad ever known before.
  7024	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7025	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAfter wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every
  7026	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvariety of thought--re-considering events, determining probabilities,
  7027	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and
  7028	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tso important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made
  7029	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther at length return home; and she entered the house with the wish
  7030	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof appearing cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such
  7031	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treflections as must make her unfit for conversation.
  7032	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7033	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each
  7034	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcalled during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes, to take
  7035	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tleave--but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least
  7036	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tan hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her
  7037	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttill she could be found. Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern
  7038	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin missing him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no
  7039	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlonger an object; she could think only of her letter.
  7040	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7041	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7042	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7043	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tChapter 37
  7044	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7045	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7046	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr. Collins having
  7047	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeen in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was
  7048	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\table to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of their appearing in very
  7049	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgood health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the
  7050	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmelancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then
  7051	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thastened, to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return
  7052	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbrought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her ladyship,
  7053	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timporting that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of
  7054	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thaving them all to dine with her.
  7055	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7056	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had
  7057	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as
  7058	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her
  7059	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tladyship’s indignation would have been. “What would she have said? how
  7060	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twould she have behaved?” were questions with which she amused herself.
  7061	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7062	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tTheir first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party. “I assure
  7063	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou, I feel it exceedingly,” said Lady Catherine; “I believe no one
  7064	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfeels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly
  7065	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tattached to these young men, and know them to be so much attached to
  7066	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tme! They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The
  7067	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdear Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy
  7068	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tseemed to feel it most acutely, more, I think, than last year. His
  7069	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tattachment to Rosings certainly increases.”
  7070	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7071	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which
  7072	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twere kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.
  7073	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7074	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of
  7075	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tspirits, and immediately accounting for it by herself, by supposing that
  7076	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe did not like to go home again so soon, she added:
  7077	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7078	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg that
  7079	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your
  7080	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcompany, I am sure.”
  7081	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7082	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,” replied
  7083	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth, “but it is not in my power to accept it. I must be in town
  7084	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnext Saturday.”
  7085	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7086	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected
  7087	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There
  7088	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcan be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly
  7089	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tspare you for another fortnight.”
  7090	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7091	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“But my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return.”
  7092	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7093	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can. Daughters
  7094	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tare never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will stay
  7095	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tanother _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as
  7096	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfar as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as
  7097	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tDawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good room
  7098	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I
  7099	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshould not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.”
  7100	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7101	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our
  7102	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\toriginal plan.”
  7103	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7104	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLady Catherine seemed resigned. “Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant
  7105	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea
  7106	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof two young women travelling post by themselves. It is highly improper.
  7107	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tYou must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in
  7108	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe world to that sort of thing. Young women should always be properly
  7109	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tguarded and attended, according to their situation in life. When my
  7110	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tniece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her
  7111	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thaving two men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the daughter of
  7112	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with
  7113	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpropriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to all those
  7114	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthings. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I
  7115	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tam glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be
  7116	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdiscreditable to _you_ to let them go alone.”
  7117	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7118	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“My uncle is to send a servant for us.”
  7119	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7120	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am very glad you
  7121	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thave somebody who thinks of these things. Where shall you change horses?
  7122	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tOh! Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be
  7123	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tattended to.”
  7124	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7125	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey,
  7126	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary,
  7127	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhich Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so
  7128	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\toccupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection must be
  7129	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it
  7130	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary
  7131	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twalk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant
  7132	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trecollections.
  7133	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7134	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Darcy’s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She
  7135	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tstudied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at
  7136	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttimes widely different. When she remembered the style of his address,
  7137	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe was still full of indignation; but when she considered how unjustly
  7138	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against
  7139	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\therself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.
  7140	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHis attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect; but she
  7141	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcould not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal,
  7142	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tor feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past
  7143	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbehaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret; and in
  7144	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin.
  7145	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThey were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at
  7146	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthem, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his
  7147	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyoungest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right
  7148	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\therself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently
  7149	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunited with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine
  7150	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother’s indulgence,
  7151	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhat chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited,
  7152	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tirritable, and completely under Lydia’s guidance, had been always
  7153	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taffronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would
  7154	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tscarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While
  7155	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthere was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while
  7156	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMeryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there
  7157	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tforever.
  7158	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7159	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAnxiety on Jane’s behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr. Darcy’s
  7160	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texplanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion,
  7161	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\theightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was proved
  7162	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto have been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any
  7163	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcould attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. How
  7164	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgrievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every
  7165	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trespect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had
  7166	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeen deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!
  7167	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7168	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWhen to these recollections was added the development of Wickham’s
  7169	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcharacter, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had
  7170	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tseldom been depressed before, were now so much affected as to make it
  7171	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\talmost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.
  7172	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7173	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tTheir engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of
  7174	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther stay as they had been at first. The very last evening was spent
  7175	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthere; and her ladyship again inquired minutely into the particulars of
  7176	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttheir journey, gave them directions as to the best method of packing,
  7177	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right
  7178	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tway, that Maria thought herself obliged, on her return, to undo all the
  7179	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twork of the morning, and pack her trunk afresh.
  7180	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7181	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWhen they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension, wished them
  7182	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year;
  7183	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her
  7184	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thand to both.

  7191	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tOn Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few
  7192	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tminutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of
  7193	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpaying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.
  7194	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7195	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I know not, Miss Elizabeth,” said he, “whether Mrs. Collins has yet
  7196	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texpressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very
  7197	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcertain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for
  7198	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit. The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you. We
  7199	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tknow how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plain
  7200	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmanner of living, our small rooms and few domestics, and the little we
  7201	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsee of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like
  7202	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,
  7203	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending
  7204	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyour time unpleasantly.”
  7205	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7206	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She
  7207	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with
  7208	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCharlotte, and the kind attentions she had received, must make _her_
  7209	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfeel the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified, and with a more smiling
  7210	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsolemnity replied:
  7211	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7212	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not
  7213	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdisagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most fortunately
  7214	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thaving it in our power to introduce you to very superior society, and,
  7215	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfrom our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of varying the
  7216	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thumble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford
  7217	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvisit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation with regard to
  7218	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLady Catherine’s family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage
  7219	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand blessing which few can boast. You see on what a footing we are. You
  7220	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsee how continually we are engaged there. In truth I must acknowledge
  7221	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I should
  7222	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion, while they are
  7223	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsharers of our intimacy at Rosings.”
  7224	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7225	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWords were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was
  7226	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tobliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility
  7227	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand truth in a few short sentences.
  7228	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7229	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into
  7230	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you will
  7231	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe able to do so. Lady Catherine’s great attentions to Mrs. Collins you
  7232	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thave been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear
  7233	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be
  7234	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth,
  7235	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in
  7236	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmarriage. My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of
  7237	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthinking. There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of
  7238	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcharacter and ideas between us. We seem to have been designed for each
  7239	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tother.”
  7240	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7241	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was
  7242	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed
  7243	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to
  7244	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thave the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang.
  7245	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tPoor Charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such society! But she
  7246	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that
  7247	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion. Her
  7248	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thome and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their
  7249	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.
  7250	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7251	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAt length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels
  7252	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tplaced within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate
  7253	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tparting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by
  7254	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Collins, and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her
  7255	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks
  7256	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his
  7257	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcompliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed her
  7258	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed,
  7259	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhen he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had
  7260	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at Rosings.
  7261	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7262	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“But,” he added, “you will of course wish to have your humble respects
  7263	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdelivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you
  7264	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhile you have been here.”
  7265	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7266	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be shut, and
  7267	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe carriage drove off.
  7268	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7269	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Good gracious!” cried Maria, after a few minutes’ silence, “it seems
  7270	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbut a day or two since we first came! and yet how many things have
  7271	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thappened!”
  7272	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7273	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“A great many indeed,” said her companion with a sigh.
  7274	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7275	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there twice!
  7276	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHow much I shall have to tell!”
  7277	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7278	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth added privately, “And how much I shall have to conceal!”
  7279	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7280	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tTheir journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and
  7281	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twithin four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached Mr. Gardiner’s
  7282	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thouse, where they were to remain a few days.
  7283	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7284	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tJane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her
  7285	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tspirits, amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her
  7286	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taunt had reserved for them. But Jane was to go home with her, and at
  7287	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLongbourn there would be leisure enough for observation.
  7288	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7289	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIt was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for
  7290	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLongbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy’s proposals. To know
  7291	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish
  7292	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tJane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own
  7293	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation
  7294	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision
  7295	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate;
  7296	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried
  7297	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinto repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve her sister
  7298	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfurther.

  7304	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7305	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIt was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out
  7306	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttogether from Gracechurch Street for the town of ----, in Hertfordshire;
  7307	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet’s carriage
  7308	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman’s
  7309	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpunctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs.
  7310	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThese two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed
  7311	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and
  7312	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdressing a salad and cucumber.
  7313	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7314	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAfter welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set
  7315	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tout with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,
  7316	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Is not this nice? Is not this an agreeable surprise?”
  7317	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7318	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And we mean to treat you all,” added Lydia, “but you must lend us the
  7319	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmoney, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.” Then, showing
  7320	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther purchases--“Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think
  7321	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall
  7322	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any
  7323	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbetter.”
  7324	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7325	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAnd when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect
  7326	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunconcern, “Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and
  7327	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhen I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I
  7328	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthink it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what
  7329	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tone wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they
  7330	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tare going in a fortnight.”
  7331	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7332	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Are they indeed!” cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.
  7333	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7334	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to
  7335	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttake us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme;
  7336	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to
  7337	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgo too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall
  7338	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thave!”
  7339	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7340	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes,” thought Elizabeth, “_that_ would be a delightful scheme indeed,
  7341	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole
  7342	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcampful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor
  7343	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tregiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!”
  7344	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7345	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Now I have got some news for you,” said Lydia, as they sat down at
  7346	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttable. “What do you think? It is excellent news--capital news--and about
  7347	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta certain person we all like!”
  7348	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7349	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tJane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told he need
  7350	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot stay. Lydia laughed, and said:
  7351	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7352	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the
  7353	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twaiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse
  7354	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthings said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad
  7355	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\the is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for
  7356	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmy news; it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not?
  7357	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThere is no danger of Wickham’s marrying Mary King. There’s for you! She
  7358	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tis gone down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay. Wickham is safe.”
  7359	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7360	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And Mary King is safe!” added Elizabeth; “safe from a connection
  7361	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timprudent as to fortune.”
  7362	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7363	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.”
  7364	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7365	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,” said Jane.
  7366	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7367	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I am sure there is not on _his_. I will answer for it, he never cared
  7368	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthree straws about her--who could about such a nasty little freckled
  7369	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthing?”
  7370	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7371	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such
  7372	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcoarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_
  7373	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas little other than her own breast had harboured and fancied liberal!
  7374	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7375	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAs soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was
  7376	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their
  7377	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tboxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty’s and
  7378	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLydia’s purchases, were seated in it.
  7379	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7380	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“How nicely we are all crammed in,” cried Lydia. “I am glad I bought my
  7381	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox! Well, now
  7382	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlet us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way
  7383	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thome. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all
  7384	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsince you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any
  7385	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tflirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband
  7386	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbefore you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.
  7387	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe is almost three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not
  7388	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeing married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Phillips wants you so to
  7389	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tget husbands, you can’t think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.
  7390	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCollins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord!
  7391	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thow I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would
  7392	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tchaperon you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece
  7393	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof fun the other day at Colonel Forster’s. Kitty and me were to spend
  7394	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the
  7395	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tevening; (by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so
  7396	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen
  7397	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We
  7398	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdressed up Chamberlayne in woman’s clothes on purpose to pass for a
  7399	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlady, only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs.
  7400	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tForster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow
  7401	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tone of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny,
  7402	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they
  7403	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdid not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs.
  7404	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tForster. I thought I should have died. And _that_ made the men suspect
  7405	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsomething, and then they soon found out what was the matter.”
  7406	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7407	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWith such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did
  7408	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLydia, assisted by Kitty’s hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her
  7409	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcompanions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she
  7410	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcould, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham’s name.
  7411	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7412	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tTheir reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane
  7413	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet
  7414	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsay voluntarily to Elizabeth:
  7415	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7416	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.”
  7417	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7418	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tTheir party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases
  7419	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcame to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects that
  7420	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\toccupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, after the welfare and
  7421	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpoultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one
  7422	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat
  7423	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsome way below her, and, on the other, retailing them all to the younger
  7424	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person’s,
  7425	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who
  7426	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twould hear her.
  7427	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7428	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh! Mary,” said she, “I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!
  7429	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAs we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and pretended there
  7430	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty
  7431	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved
  7432	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvery handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold
  7433	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tluncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated
  7434	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never
  7435	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshould have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then
  7436	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twe were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that
  7437	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tanybody might have heard us ten miles off!”
  7438	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7439	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tTo this Mary very gravely replied, “Far be it from me, my dear sister,
  7440	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto depreciate such pleasures! They would doubtless be congenial with the
  7441	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgenerality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for
  7442	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t_me_--I should infinitely prefer a book.”
  7443	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7444	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBut of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to
  7445	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tanybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.
  7446	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7447	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIn the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk
  7448	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily
  7449	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\topposed the scheme. It should not be said that the Miss Bennets could
  7450	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers.
  7451	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThere was another reason too for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Mr.
  7452	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The
  7453	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcomfort to _her_ of the regiment’s approaching removal was indeed beyond
  7454	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texpression. In a fortnight they were to go--and once gone, she hoped
  7455	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthere could be nothing more to plague her on his account.
  7456	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7457	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe had not been many hours at home before she found that the Brighton
  7458	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tscheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under
  7459	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfrequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her
  7460	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfather had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were
  7461	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tat the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often
  7462	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdisheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.
  7463	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7464	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7465	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7466	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tChapter 40
  7467	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7468	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7469	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth’s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could
  7470	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tno longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to suppress every
  7471	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tparticular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be
  7472	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsurprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene
  7473	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbetween Mr. Darcy and herself.
  7474	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7475	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMiss Bennet’s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly
  7476	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpartiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly
  7477	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnatural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was
  7478	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so
  7479	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlittle suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the
  7480	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunhappiness which her sister’s refusal must have given him.
  7481	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7482	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,” said she, “and certainly
  7483	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his
  7484	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdisappointment!”
  7485	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7486	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Indeed,” replied Elizabeth, “I am heartily sorry for him; but he has
  7487	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tother feelings, which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.
  7488	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tYou do not blame me, however, for refusing him?”
  7489	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7490	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Blame you! Oh, no.”
  7491	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7492	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?”
  7493	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7494	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.”
  7495	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7496	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“But you _will_ know it, when I tell you what happened the very next
  7497	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tday.”
  7498	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7499	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far
  7500	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane!
  7501	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twho would willingly have gone through the world without believing that
  7502	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tso much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind, as was here
  7503	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcollected in one individual. Nor was Darcy’s vindication, though
  7504	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgrateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.
  7505	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMost earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and
  7506	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tseek to clear the one without involving the other.
  7507	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7508	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“This will not do,” said Elizabeth; “you never will be able to make both
  7509	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied
  7510	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just
  7511	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tenough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting
  7512	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tabout pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Darcy’s;
  7513	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbut you shall do as you choose.”
  7514	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7515	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIt was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.
  7516	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7517	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I do not know when I have been more shocked,” said she. “Wickham so
  7518	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvery bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! Dear Lizzy, only
  7519	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconsider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the
  7520	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tknowledge of your ill opinion, too! and having to relate such a thing
  7521	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof his sister! It is really too distressing. I am sure you must feel it
  7522	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tso.”
  7523	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7524	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so
  7525	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfull of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am
  7526	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgrowing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion
  7527	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmakes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will
  7528	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe as light as a feather.”
  7529	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7530	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his
  7531	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcountenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner!”
  7532	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7533	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those
  7534	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttwo young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the
  7535	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tappearance of it.”
  7536	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7537	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you
  7538	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tused to do.”
  7539	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7540	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike
  7541	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one’s genius, such an
  7542	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\topening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually
  7543	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tabusive without saying anything just; but one cannot always be laughing
  7544	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tat a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.”
  7545	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7546	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat
  7547	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe matter as you do now.”
  7548	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7549	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I may say unhappy. And
  7550	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith no one to speak to about what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and say
  7551	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I
  7552	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad! Oh! how I wanted you!”
  7553	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7554	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions
  7555	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly
  7556	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tundeserved.”
  7557	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7558	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most
  7559	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnatural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There
  7560	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tis one point on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I
  7561	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tought, or ought not, to make our acquaintances in general understand
  7562	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWickham’s character.”
  7563	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7564	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMiss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, “Surely there can be no
  7565	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\toccasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your opinion?”
  7566	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7567	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised me
  7568	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto make his communication public. On the contrary, every particular
  7569	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trelative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to
  7570	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmyself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his
  7571	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy
  7572	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tis so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in
  7573	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMeryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal
  7574	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto it. Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to
  7575	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tanyone here what he really is. Some time hence it will be all found out,
  7576	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At
  7577	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpresent I will say nothing about it.”
  7578	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7579	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for
  7580	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tever. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to
  7581	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tre-establish a character. We must not make him desperate.”
  7582	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7583	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe tumult of Elizabeth’s mind was allayed by this conversation. She had
  7584	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgot rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight,
  7585	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish
  7586	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto talk again of either. But there was still something lurking behind,
  7587	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof which prudence forbade the disclosure. She dared not relate the other
  7588	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thalf of Mr. Darcy’s letter, nor explain to her sister how sincerely she
  7589	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad been valued by her friend. Here was knowledge in which no one
  7590	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcould partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect
  7591	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunderstanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off
  7592	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthis last encumbrance of mystery. “And then,” said she, “if that very
  7593	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timprobable event should ever take place, I shall merely be able to
  7594	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself. The
  7595	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tliberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value!”
  7596	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7597	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real
  7598	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tstate of her sister’s spirits. Jane was not happy. She still cherished a
  7599	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvery tender affection for Bingley. Having never even fancied herself
  7600	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment,
  7601	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand, from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than most first
  7602	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tattachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance,
  7603	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her
  7604	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tattention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the
  7605	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tindulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own
  7606	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thealth and their tranquillity.
  7607	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7608	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Well, Lizzy,” said Mrs. Bennet one day, “what is your opinion _now_ of
  7609	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthis sad business of Jane’s? For my part, I am determined never to speak
  7610	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof it again to anybody. I told my sister Phillips so the other day. But
  7611	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI cannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London. Well, he is
  7612	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta very undeserving young man--and I do not suppose there’s the least
  7613	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tchance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of
  7614	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired of
  7615	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teverybody, too, who is likely to know.”
  7616	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7617	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more.”
  7618	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7619	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come. Though I
  7620	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I
  7621	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twould not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will
  7622	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdie of a broken heart; and then he will be sorry for what he has done.”
  7623	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7624	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBut as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation,
  7625	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe made no answer.
  7626	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7627	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Well, Lizzy,” continued her mother, soon afterwards, “and so the
  7628	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCollinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope
  7629	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an
  7630	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texcellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her
  7631	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmother, she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in _their_
  7632	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thousekeeping, I dare say.”
  7633	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7634	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“No, nothing at all.”
  7635	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7636	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes, _they_ will
  7637	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttake care not to outrun their income. _They_ will never be distressed
  7638	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor money. Well, much good may it do them! And so, I suppose, they often
  7639	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttalk of having Longbourn when your father is dead. They look upon it as
  7640	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tquite their own, I dare say, whenever that happens.”
  7641	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7642	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“It was a subject which they could not mention before me.”
  7643	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7644	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no doubt they
  7645	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\toften talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be easy with an
  7646	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\testate that is not lawfully their own, so much the better. I should be
  7647	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tashamed of having one that was only entailed on me.”
  7648	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t

  7652	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7653	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7654	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was
  7655	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe last of the regiment’s stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies
  7656	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost
  7657	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tuniversal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,
  7658	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very
  7659	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfrequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and
  7660	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such
  7661	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thard-heartedness in any of the family.
  7662	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7663	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Good Heaven! what is to become of us? What are we to do?” would they
  7664	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\toften exclaim in the bitterness of woe. “How can you be smiling so,
  7665	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLizzy?”
  7666	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7667	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tTheir affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what
  7668	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe had herself endured on a similar occasion, five-and-twenty years
  7669	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tago.
  7670	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7671	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I am sure,” said she, “I cried for two days together when Colonel
  7672	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMiller’s regiment went away. I thought I should have broken my heart.”
  7673	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7674	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I am sure I shall break _mine_,” said Lydia.
  7675	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7676	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“If one could but go to Brighton!” observed Mrs. Bennet.
  7677	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7678	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh, yes!--if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so
  7679	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdisagreeable.”
  7680	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7681	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“A little sea-bathing would set me up forever.”
  7682	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7683	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,”
  7684	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t added Kitty.
  7685	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7686	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tSuch were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through
  7687	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLongbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense
  7688	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy’s
  7689	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tobjections; and never had she been so much disposed to pardon his
  7690	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinterference in the views of his friend.
  7691	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7692	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBut the gloom of Lydia’s prospect was shortly cleared away; for she
  7693	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treceived an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of
  7694	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a
  7695	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvery young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good humour
  7696	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of
  7697	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttheir _three_ months’ acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.
  7698	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7699	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster,
  7700	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely
  7701	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister’s feelings, Lydia
  7702	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tflew about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone’s
  7703	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcongratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;
  7704	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate
  7705	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.
  7706	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7707	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,”
  7708	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t said she, “Though I am _not_ her particular friend. I have just as much
  7709	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tright to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.”
  7710	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7711	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIn vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make
  7712	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from
  7713	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she
  7714	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconsidered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense
  7715	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it
  7716	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tknown, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her
  7717	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgo. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia’s general
  7718	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbehaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of
  7719	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuch a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more
  7720	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must
  7721	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said:
  7722	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7723	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public
  7724	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tplace or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so
  7725	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlittle expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present
  7726	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcircumstances.”
  7727	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7728	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“If you were aware,” said Elizabeth, “of the very great disadvantage to
  7729	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tus all which must arise from the public notice of Lydia’s unguarded and
  7730	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timprudent manner--nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you
  7731	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twould judge differently in the affair.”
  7732	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7733	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Already arisen?” repeated Mr. Bennet. “What, has she frightened away
  7734	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsome of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such
  7735	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsqueamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity
  7736	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tare not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of pitiful fellows who
  7737	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thave been kept aloof by Lydia’s folly.”
  7738	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7739	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not
  7740	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof particular, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our
  7741	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timportance, our respectability in the world must be affected by the
  7742	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark
  7743	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLydia’s character. Excuse me, for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear
  7744	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfather, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and
  7745	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of
  7746	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character
  7747	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twill be fixed, and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt
  7748	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat ever made herself or her family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in the
  7749	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tworst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond
  7750	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyouth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness
  7751	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal
  7752	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcontempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger
  7753	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tKitty also is comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain,
  7754	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! my dear father, can you
  7755	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever
  7756	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthey are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the
  7757	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdisgrace?”
  7758	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7759	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject, and
  7760	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taffectionately taking her hand said in reply:
  7761	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7762	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known
  7763	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less
  7764	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tadvantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three--very silly
  7765	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to
  7766	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBrighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will
  7767	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tkeep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an
  7768	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tobject of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will be of less importance
  7769	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teven as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find
  7770	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twomen better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being
  7771	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthere may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow
  7772	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmany degrees worse, without authorising us to lock her up for the rest
  7773	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof her life.”
  7774	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7775	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWith this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion
  7776	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcontinued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was not
  7777	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on
  7778	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthem. She was confident of having performed her duty, and to fret
  7779	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tover unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her
  7780	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdisposition.
  7781	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7782	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHad Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her
  7783	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfather, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their
  7784	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunited volubility. In Lydia’s imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised
  7785	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tevery possibility of earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eye
  7786	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers.
  7787	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe saw herself the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them
  7788	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tat present unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp--its tents
  7789	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tstretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young
  7790	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she
  7791	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsaw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six
  7792	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tofficers at once.
  7793	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7794	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHad she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such
  7795	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trealities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could have
  7796	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeen understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the same.
  7797	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLydia’s going to Brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy
  7798	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconviction of her husband’s never intending to go there himself.
  7799	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7800	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBut they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures
  7801	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcontinued, with little intermission, to the very day of Lydia’s leaving
  7802	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thome.
  7803	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7804	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been
  7805	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfrequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty
  7806	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twell over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She had even
  7807	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlearnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted
  7808	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present
  7809	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbehaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure,
  7810	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which
  7811	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after
  7812	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhat had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in
  7813	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfinding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous
  7814	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the
  7815	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever
  7816	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified,
  7817	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand her preference secured at any time by their renewal.
  7818	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7819	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tOn the very last day of the regiment’s remaining at Meryton, he dined,
  7820	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith other of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth
  7821	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdisposed to part from him in good humour, that on his making some
  7822	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she
  7823	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam’s and Mr. Darcy’s having both spent three
  7824	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tweeks at Rosings, and asked him, if he was acquainted with the former.
  7825	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7826	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHe looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment’s
  7827	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trecollection and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen
  7828	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man,
  7829	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tasked her how she had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour.
  7830	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWith an air of indifference he soon afterwards added:
  7831	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7832	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“How long did you say he was at Rosings?”
  7833	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7834	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Nearly three weeks.”
  7835	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7836	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And you saw him frequently?”
  7837	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7838	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes, almost every day.”

  7840	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“His manners are very different from his cousin’s.”
  7841	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7842	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon acquaintance.”
  7843	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7844	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Indeed!” cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape her. “And
  7845	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpray, may I ask?--” But checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, “Is
  7846	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit in address that he improves? Has he deigned to add aught of civility
  7847	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto his ordinary style?--for I dare not hope,” he continued in a lower
  7848	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand more serious tone, “that he is improved in essentials.”
  7849	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7850	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh, no!” said Elizabeth. “In essentials, I believe, he is very much
  7851	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhat he ever was.”
  7852	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7853	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWhile she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to
  7854	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a
  7855	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsomething in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive
  7856	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand anxious attention, while she added:
  7857	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7858	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that
  7859	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this mind or his manners were in a state of improvement, but that, from
  7860	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tknowing him better, his disposition was better understood.”
  7861	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7862	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWickham’s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated
  7863	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlook; for a few minutes he was silent, till, shaking off his
  7864	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tembarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of
  7865	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taccents:
  7866	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7867	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will readily
  7868	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcomprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume
  7869	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teven the _appearance_ of what is right. His pride, in that direction,
  7870	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmay be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must only
  7871	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdeter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only
  7872	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfear that the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been
  7873	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\talluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good
  7874	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\topinion and judgement he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always
  7875	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\toperated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be
  7876	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I
  7877	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tam certain he has very much at heart.”
  7878	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7879	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a
  7880	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tslight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on
  7881	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge
  7882	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim. The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his
  7883	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tside, of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish
  7884	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a
  7885	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmutual desire of never meeting again.
  7886	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7887	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWhen the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to Meryton,
  7888	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfrom whence they were to set out early the next morning. The separation
  7889	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbetween her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic. Kitty was the
  7890	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tonly one who shed tears; but she did weep from vexation and envy. Mrs.
  7891	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter,
  7892	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the
  7893	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\topportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible--advice which
  7894	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthere was every reason to believe would be well attended to; and in
  7895	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more
  7896	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard.

  7902	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7903	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHad Elizabeth’s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could
  7904	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic
  7905	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcomfort. Her father, captivated by youth and beauty, and that appearance
  7906	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof good humour which youth and beauty generally give, had married a
  7907	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twoman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in
  7908	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttheir marriage put an end to all real affection for her. Respect,
  7909	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\testeem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views
  7910	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof domestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of
  7911	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own
  7912	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timprudence had brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often
  7913	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconsole the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of
  7914	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal
  7915	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tenjoyments. To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted, than as
  7916	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement. This is not
  7917	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his
  7918	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twife; but where other powers of entertainment are wanting, the true
  7919	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tphilosopher will derive benefit from such as are given.
  7920	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7921	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of her
  7922	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfather’s behaviour as a husband. She had always seen it with pain; but
  7923	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trespecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of
  7924	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\therself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to
  7925	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbanish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation
  7926	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own
  7927	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tchildren, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so
  7928	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tstrongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so
  7929	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising
  7930	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfrom so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which, rightly used,
  7931	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmight at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even
  7932	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tif incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.
  7933	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7934	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWhen Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham’s departure she found little
  7935	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tother cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment. Their parties
  7936	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tabroad were less varied than before, and at home she had a mother and
  7937	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around
  7938	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthem threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty
  7939	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmight in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers
  7940	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition
  7941	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgreater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all
  7942	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a
  7943	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twatering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what
  7944	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thas been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had been
  7945	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlooking with impatient desire did not, in taking place, bring all the
  7946	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsatisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to
  7947	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tname some other period for the commencement of actual felicity--to have
  7948	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsome other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by
  7949	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tagain enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the
  7950	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpresent, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes
  7951	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation
  7952	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother
  7953	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the
  7954	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tscheme, every part of it would have been perfect.
  7955	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7956	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“But it is fortunate,” thought she, “that I have something to wish for.
  7957	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWere the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.
  7958	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBut here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my
  7959	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsister’s absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of
  7960	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpleasure realised. A scheme of which every part promises delight can
  7961	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnever be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by
  7962	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe defence of some little peculiar vexation.”
  7963	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7964	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWhen Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely
  7965	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and
  7966	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\talways very short. Those to her mother contained little else than that
  7967	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthey were just returned from the library, where such and such officers
  7968	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as
  7969	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmade her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which
  7970	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a
  7971	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tviolent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going off to
  7972	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe camp; and from her correspondence with her sister, there was still
  7973	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tless to be learnt--for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were
  7974	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmuch too full of lines under the words to be made public.
  7975	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7976	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAfter the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good
  7977	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thumour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything wore
  7978	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came
  7979	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tback again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet
  7980	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas restored to her usual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of
  7981	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tJune, Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without
  7982	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by
  7983	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to
  7984	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious
  7985	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tarrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be quartered in
  7986	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMeryton.
  7987	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  7988	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast
  7989	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tapproaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter
  7990	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tarrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and
  7991	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcurtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from
  7992	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsetting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again
  7993	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twithin a month, and as that left too short a period for them to go so
  7994	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfar, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with
  7995	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up
  7996	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to the
  7997	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpresent plan, were to go no farther northwards than Derbyshire. In that
  7998	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcounty there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three
  7999	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tweeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The
  8000	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttown where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where
  8001	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthey were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of
  8002	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,
  8003	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tDovedale, or the Peak.
  8004	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8005	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth was excessively disappointed; she had set her heart on seeing
  8006	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe Lakes, and still thought there might have been time enough. But it
  8007	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;
  8008	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand all was soon right again.
  8009	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8010	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWith the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected. It was
  8011	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timpossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its
  8012	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\towner. “But surely,” said she, “I may enter his county with impunity,
  8013	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me.”
  8014	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8015	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away
  8016	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbefore her uncle and aunt’s arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr.
  8017	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at
  8018	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLongbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two
  8019	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyounger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their
  8020	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcousin Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and
  8021	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every
  8022	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tway--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.
  8023	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8024	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the
  8025	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnext morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.
  8026	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tOne enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness of companions;
  8027	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear
  8028	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection
  8029	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were
  8030	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdisappointments abroad.
  8031	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8032	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIt is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,
  8033	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither
  8034	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc. are
  8035	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present
  8036	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconcern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner’s
  8037	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tformer residence, and where she had lately learned some acquaintance
  8038	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tstill remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the
  8039	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tprincipal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton,
  8040	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth found from her aunt that Pemberley was situated. It was not
  8041	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In
  8042	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttalking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed
  8043	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tan inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his
  8044	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twillingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.
  8045	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8046	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard
  8047	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tso much?” said her aunt; “a place, too, with which so many of your
  8048	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tacquaintances are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you
  8049	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tknow.”
  8050	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8051	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at
  8052	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tPemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She
  8053	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmust own that she was tired of seeing great houses; after going over so
  8054	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmany, she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.
  8055	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8056	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. “If it were merely a fine house
  8057	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trichly furnished,” said she, “I should not care about it myself; but
  8058	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the
  8059	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcountry.”
  8060	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8061	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce. The
  8062	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpossibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly
  8063	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\toccurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea, and
  8064	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such
  8065	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta risk. But against this there were objections; and she finally resolved
  8066	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries to the
  8067	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tabsence of the family were unfavourably answered.
  8068	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8069	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAccordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid
  8070	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhether Pemberley were not a very fine place? what was the name of its
  8071	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tproprietor? and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for
  8072	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe summer? A most welcome negative followed the last question--and her
  8073	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\talarms now being removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of
  8074	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcuriosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the
  8075	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnext morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and
  8076	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike
  8077	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto the scheme. To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.

  8083	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8084	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of
  8085	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tPemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned
  8086	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.
  8087	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8088	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They
  8089	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tentered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through
  8090	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.
  8091	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8092	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth’s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired
  8093	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tevery remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for
  8094	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thalf-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable
  8095	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by
  8096	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tPemberley House, situated on the opposite side of a valley, into which
  8097	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone
  8098	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbuilding, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of
  8099	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thigh woody hills; and in front, a stream of some natural importance was
  8100	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tswelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks
  8101	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twere neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She
  8102	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural
  8103	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were
  8104	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tall of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that
  8105	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto be mistress of Pemberley might be something!
  8106	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8107	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThey descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,
  8108	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhile examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of
  8109	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmeeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been
  8110	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the
  8111	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to
  8112	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twonder at her being where she was.
  8113	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8114	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much less
  8115	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They
  8116	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfollowed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well proportioned
  8117	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\troom, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went
  8118	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, which
  8119	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthey had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the distance,
  8120	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was good; and
  8121	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its
  8122	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbanks and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace it,
  8123	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith delight. As they passed into other rooms these objects were taking
  8124	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdifferent positions; but from every window there were beauties to be
  8125	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tseen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to
  8126	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe fortune of its proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of
  8127	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of
  8128	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsplendour, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.
  8129	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8130	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And of this place,” thought she, “I might have been mistress! With
  8131	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthese rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted! Instead of
  8132	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tviewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and
  8133	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twelcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But no,”--recollecting
  8134	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\therself--“that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to
  8135	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tme; I should not have been allowed to invite them.”
  8136	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8137	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThis was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something very like
  8138	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tregret.
  8139	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8140	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really
  8141	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tabsent, but had not the courage for it. At length however, the question
  8142	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs.
  8143	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tReynolds replied that he was, adding, “But we expect him to-morrow, with
  8144	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta large party of friends.” How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own
  8145	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tjourney had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!
  8146	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8147	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHer aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached and saw the
  8148	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlikeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other miniatures,
  8149	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tover the mantelpiece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how she liked it.
  8150	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe housekeeper came forward, and told them it was a picture of a young
  8151	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgentleman, the son of her late master’s steward, who had been brought
  8152	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tup by him at his own expense. “He is now gone into the army,” she added;
  8153	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.”
  8154	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8155	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not
  8156	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treturn it.
  8157	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8158	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And that,” said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,
  8159	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“is my master--and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the
  8160	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tother--about eight years ago.”
  8161	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8162	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I have heard much of your master’s fine person,” said Mrs. Gardiner,
  8163	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlooking at the picture; “it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell
  8164	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tus whether it is like or not.”
  8165	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8166	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this
  8167	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tintimation of her knowing her master.
  8168	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8169	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?”
  8170	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8171	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth coloured, and said: “A little.”
  8172	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8173	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma’am?”
  8174	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8175	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes, very handsome.”
  8176	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8177	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I am sure I know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you
  8178	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twill see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late
  8179	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmaster’s favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to
  8180	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe then. He was very fond of them.”
  8181	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8182	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThis accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham’s being among them.
  8183	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8184	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn
  8185	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhen she was only eight years old.
  8186	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8187	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?” said Mrs. Gardiner.
  8188	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8189	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh! yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so
  8190	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taccomplished!--She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is
  8191	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master; she
  8192	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcomes here to-morrow with him.”
  8193	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8194	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged her
  8195	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcommunicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either
  8196	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tby pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her
  8197	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmaster and his sister.
  8198	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8199	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?”
  8200	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8201	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend half his
  8202	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttime here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.”
  8203	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8204	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Except,” thought Elizabeth, “when she goes to Ramsgate.”
  8205	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8206	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“If your master would marry, you might see more of him.”
  8207	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8208	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know who is
  8209	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgood enough for him.”
  8210	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8211	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, “It is
  8212	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvery much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.”
  8213	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8214	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows him,”
  8215	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far; and she
  8216	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlistened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added, “I have
  8217	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnever known a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him ever
  8218	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsince he was four years old.”
  8219	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8220	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThis was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her
  8221	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.
  8222	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHer keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was
  8223	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgrateful to her uncle for saying:
  8224	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8225	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in
  8226	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thaving such a master.”
  8227	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8228	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could
  8229	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are
  8230	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgood-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and
  8231	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\the was always the sweetest-tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the
  8232	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tworld.”
  8233	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8234	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth almost stared at her. “Can this be Mr. Darcy?” thought she.
  8235	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8236	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“His father was an excellent man,” said Mrs. Gardiner.
  8237	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8238	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes, ma’am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just
  8239	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas affable to the poor.”
  8240	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8241	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs.
  8242	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tReynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjects
  8243	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the
  8244	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfurniture, in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family
  8245	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tprejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her
  8246	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmaster, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his
  8247	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmany merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase.
  8248	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8249	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“He is the best landlord, and the best master,” said she, “that ever
  8250	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of nothing but
  8251	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthemselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but will give
  8252	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never saw
  8253	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tanything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away
  8254	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlike other young men.”
  8255	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8256	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“In what an amiable light does this place him!” thought Elizabeth.
  8257	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8258	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“This fine account of him,” whispered her aunt as they walked, “is not
  8259	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tquite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.”
  8260	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8261	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Perhaps we might be deceived.”
  8262	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8263	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“That is not very likely; our authority was too good.”
  8264	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8265	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tOn reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty
  8266	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than
  8267	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to
  8268	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgive pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room when
  8269	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlast at Pemberley.
  8270	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8271	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“He is certainly a good brother,” said Elizabeth, as she walked towards
  8272	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tone of the windows.
  8273	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8274	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy’s delight, when she should enter
  8275	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe room. “And this is always the way with him,” she added. “Whatever
  8276	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcan give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment. There
  8277	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tis nothing he would not do for her.”
  8278	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8279	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms, were
  8280	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tall that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings;
  8281	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbut Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already
  8282	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvisible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss
  8283	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tDarcy’s, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and
  8284	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\talso more intelligible.
  8285	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8286	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIn the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have
  8287	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlittle to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked in quest of
  8288	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe only face whose features would be known to her. At last it arrested
  8289	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther--and she beheld a striking resemblance to Mr. Darcy, with such a
  8290	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsmile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he
  8291	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlooked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture, in earnest
  8292	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcontemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery.
  8293	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his father’s
  8294	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlifetime.
  8295	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8296	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThere was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth’s mind, a more gentle
  8297	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of
  8298	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttheir acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds
  8299	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise
  8300	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she
  8301	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconsidered how many people’s happiness were in his guardianship!--how
  8302	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmuch of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestow!--how much of
  8303	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgood or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought
  8304	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tforward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character, and as she
  8305	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tstood before the canvas on which he was represented, and fixed his
  8306	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teyes upon herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of
  8307	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgratitude than it had ever raised before; she remembered its warmth, and
  8308	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsoftened its impropriety of expression.
  8309	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8310	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWhen all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,
  8311	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthey returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were
  8312	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconsigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall-door.
  8313	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8314	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAs they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth turned back
  8315	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also, and while the former
  8316	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself
  8317	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuddenly came forward from the road, which led behind it to the stables.
  8318	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8319	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThey were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was his
  8320	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tappearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes
  8321	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinstantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest
  8322	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tblush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from
  8323	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsurprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,
  8324	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least
  8325	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof perfect civility.
  8326	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8327	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,
  8328	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treceived his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be
  8329	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tovercome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture
  8330	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthey had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two
  8331	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener’s expression of surprise, on
  8332	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little
  8333	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,
  8334	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tscarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer
  8335	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe returned to his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at the
  8336	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\talteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that
  8337	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\the uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the
  8338	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timpropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few
  8339	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tminutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in
  8340	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he spoke, his accent
  8341	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his inquiries as
  8342	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her having stayed in
  8343	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tDerbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the
  8344	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdistraction of his thoughts.
  8345	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8346	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAt length every idea seemed to fail him; and, after standing a few
  8347	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmoments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took
  8348	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tleave.
  8349	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8350	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe others then joined her, and expressed admiration of his figure; but
  8351	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by her own feelings,
  8352	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfollowed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and vexation. Her
  8353	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcoming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged thing in the
  8354	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tworld! How strange it must appear to him! In what a disgraceful light
  8355	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmight it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if she had purposely
  8356	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come? Or, why did he
  8357	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthus come a day before he was expected? Had they been only ten minutes
  8358	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination;
  8359	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor it was plain that he was that moment arrived--that moment alighted
  8360	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfrom his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and again over
  8361	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so strikingly
  8362	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taltered--what could it mean? That he should even speak to her was
  8363	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tamazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her family!
  8364	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tNever in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified, never
  8365	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What
  8366	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when he put
  8367	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to account
  8368	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor it.
  8369	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8370	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThey had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and
  8371	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tevery step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer
  8372	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it was some time
  8373	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbefore Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered
  8374	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and
  8375	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tseemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she
  8376	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdistinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that
  8377	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tone spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then
  8378	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas. She longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mind--in
  8379	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhat manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything,
  8380	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he
  8381	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfelt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice which was
  8382	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in
  8383	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tseeing her she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with
  8384	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcomposure.
  8385	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8386	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAt length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind
  8387	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.
  8388	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8389	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThey entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a while,
  8390	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where the opening of
  8391	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of the
  8392	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvalley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods overspreading
  8393	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmany, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish
  8394	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof going round the whole park, but feared it might be beyond a walk.
  8395	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWith a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round.
  8396	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIt settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which
  8397	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbrought them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods,
  8398	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They crossed
  8399	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of the scene;
  8400	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and the
  8401	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvalley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the stream,
  8402	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered it.
  8403	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed the
  8404	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,
  8405	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twho was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only
  8406	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,
  8407	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttherefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house
  8408	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ton the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their
  8409	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tprogress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the
  8410	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttaste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the
  8411	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\toccasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the
  8412	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tman about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this
  8413	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tslow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth’s astonishment
  8414	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy
  8415	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tapproaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here
  8416	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tless sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before
  8417	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthey met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared
  8418	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor an interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with
  8419	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcalmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,
  8420	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idea
  8421	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the
  8422	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tturning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance, she saw
  8423	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his
  8424	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpoliteness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place;
  8425	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbut she had not got beyond the words “delightful,” and “charming,” when
  8426	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsome unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of
  8427	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tPemberley from her might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed,
  8428	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand she said no more.
  8429	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8430	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked
  8431	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.
  8432	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThis was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared;
  8433	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the
  8434	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tacquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had
  8435	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trevolted in his offer to herself. “What will be his surprise,” thought
  8436	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe, “when he knows who they are? He takes them now for people of
  8437	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfashion.”
  8438	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8439	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their
  8440	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trelationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore
  8441	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit, and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he
  8442	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcould from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by the
  8443	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconnection was evident; he sustained it, however, with fortitude, and
  8444	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tso far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into
  8445	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased,
  8446	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcould not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had
  8447	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsome relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most
  8448	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tattentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every
  8449	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texpression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,
  8450	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this taste, or his good manners.
  8451	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8452	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy
  8453	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinvite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he
  8454	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tchose while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time
  8455	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of
  8456	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was
  8457	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twalking arm-in-arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of wonder.
  8458	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the compliment
  8459	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmust be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was extreme, and
  8460	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcontinually was she repeating, “Why is he so altered? From what can
  8461	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit proceed? It cannot be for _me_--it cannot be for _my_ sake that his
  8462	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmanners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a
  8463	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tchange as this. It is impossible that he should still love me.”
  8464	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8465	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAfter walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two
  8466	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to
  8467	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious
  8468	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twater-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated
  8469	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found
  8470	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth’s arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred
  8471	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther husband’s. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on
  8472	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttogether. After a short silence, the lady first spoke. She wished him
  8473	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the
  8474	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tplace, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been
  8475	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvery unexpected--“for your housekeeper,” she added, “informed us that
  8476	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed, before we
  8477	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tleft Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected
  8478	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin the country.” He acknowledged the truth of it all, and said that
  8479	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbusiness with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours
  8480	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbefore the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. “They
  8481	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twill join me early to-morrow,” he continued, “and among them are some
  8482	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twho will claim an acquaintance with you--Mr. Bingley and his sisters.”
  8483	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8484	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly
  8485	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdriven back to the time when Mr. Bingley’s name had been the last
  8486	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmentioned between them; and, if she might judge by his complexion, _his_
  8487	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmind was not very differently engaged.
  8488	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8489	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“There is also one other person in the party,” he continued after a
  8490	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpause, “who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow
  8491	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tme, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance
  8492	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tduring your stay at Lambton?”
  8493	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8494	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great
  8495	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt
  8496	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her
  8497	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmust be the work of her brother, and, without looking farther, it was
  8498	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsatisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made
  8499	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim think really ill of her.
  8500	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8501	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThey now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth
  8502	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and
  8503	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of
  8504	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe highest kind. They soon outstripped the others, and when they had
  8505	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a
  8506	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmile behind.
  8507	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8508	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHe then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not
  8509	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might
  8510	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thave been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but
  8511	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthere seemed to be an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected
  8512	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale
  8513	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her
  8514	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpatience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tete-a-tete was
  8515	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tover. On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s coming up they were all pressed to go
  8516	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinto the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and
  8517	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthey parted on each side with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the
  8518	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him
  8519	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twalking slowly towards the house.
  8520	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8521	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them
  8522	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.
  8523	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming,” said her uncle.
  8524	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8525	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“There _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure,” replied her
  8526	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taunt, “but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now
  8527	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsay with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, I
  8528	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thave seen nothing of it.”
  8529	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8530	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more
  8531	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthan civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such
  8532	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tattention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.”
  8533	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8534	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“To be sure, Lizzy,” said her aunt, “he is not so handsome as Wickham;
  8535	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tor, rather, he has not Wickham’s countenance, for his features
  8536	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tare perfectly good. But how came you to tell me that he was so
  8537	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdisagreeable?”
  8538	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8539	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked
  8540	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim better when they had met in Kent than before, and that she had never
  8541	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tseen him so pleasant as this morning.
  8542	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8543	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,” replied
  8544	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther uncle. “Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him
  8545	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tat his word, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off
  8546	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this grounds.”
  8547	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8548	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character, but
  8549	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsaid nothing.
  8550	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8551	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“From what we have seen of him,” continued Mrs. Gardiner, “I really
  8552	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshould not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by
  8553	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tanybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look.
  8554	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tOn the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he
  8555	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tspeaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance that would
  8556	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the
  8557	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgood lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character!
  8558	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal
  8559	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmaster, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every
  8560	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvirtue.”
  8561	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8562	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of
  8563	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in
  8564	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from
  8565	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different
  8566	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconstruction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor
  8567	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWickham’s so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In
  8568	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconfirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary
  8569	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttransactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming
  8570	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.
  8571	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8572	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now
  8573	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tapproaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to
  8574	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out
  8575	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of
  8576	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tanything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning’s walk they
  8577	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former
  8578	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tacquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of a
  8579	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tintercourse renewed after many years’ discontinuance.
  8580	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8581	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth
  8582	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmuch attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing
  8583	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbut think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy’s civility, and, above
  8584	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tall, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.
  8585	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t

  8587	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8588	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tChapter 44
  8589	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8590	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8591	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit
  8592	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was consequently
  8593	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tresolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.
  8594	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBut her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their
  8595	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tarrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They had been walking about the
  8596	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tplace with some of their new friends, and were just returning to the inn
  8597	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a
  8598	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcarriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady in
  8599	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta curricle driving up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognizing
  8600	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her
  8601	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsurprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she
  8602	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texpected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment
  8603	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many
  8604	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on
  8605	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they felt that
  8606	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthere was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a
  8607	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tquarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these
  8608	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnewly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of
  8609	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth’s feelings was at every moment increasing. She was quite
  8610	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tamazed at her own discomposure; but amongst other causes of disquiet,
  8611	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much
  8612	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally
  8613	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.
  8614	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8615	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked
  8616	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tup and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of
  8617	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.
  8618	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8619	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMiss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction
  8620	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttook place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new
  8621	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tacquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her
  8622	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeing at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;
  8623	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbut the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was
  8624	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tonly exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from
  8625	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther beyond a monosyllable.
  8626	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8627	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMiss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though
  8628	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlittle more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance
  8629	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twomanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother; but there
  8630	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly
  8631	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as
  8632	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tacute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much
  8633	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trelieved by discerning such different feelings.
  8634	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8635	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThey had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her that Bingley
  8636	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her
  8637	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsatisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley’s quick
  8638	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tstep was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All
  8639	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth’s anger against him had been long done away; but had she still
  8640	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfelt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected
  8641	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He
  8642	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family, and looked
  8643	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.
  8644	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8645	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tTo Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage
  8646	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthan to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before
  8647	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthem, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just
  8648	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tarisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece directed their observation towards
  8649	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teach with an earnest though guarded inquiry; and they soon drew from
  8650	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthose inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew
  8651	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhat it was to love. Of the lady’s sensations they remained a little
  8652	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was
  8653	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tevident enough.
  8654	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8655	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the
  8656	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfeelings of each of her visitors; she wanted to compose her own, and
  8657	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she
  8658	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfeared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she
  8659	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tendeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley
  8660	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.
  8661	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8662	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIn seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and, oh!
  8663	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thow ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in
  8664	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on
  8665	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tformer occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion
  8666	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But,
  8667	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthough this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his
  8668	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbehaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No look
  8669	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tappeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred
  8670	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbetween them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point
  8671	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred
  8672	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a
  8673	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trecollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying
  8674	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmore that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed
  8675	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone
  8676	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhich had something of real regret, that it “was a very long time since
  8677	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\the had had the pleasure of seeing her;” and, before she could reply,
  8678	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\the added, “It is above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of
  8679	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tNovember, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.”
  8680	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8681	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards
  8682	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttook occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether
  8683	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t_all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question,
  8684	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which
  8685	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgave them meaning.
  8686	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8687	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIt was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself;
  8688	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbut, whenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general
  8689	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcomplaisance, and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed
  8690	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfrom _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that
  8691	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however
  8692	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttemporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When
  8693	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion
  8694	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a
  8695	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdisgrace--when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the
  8696	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvery relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last
  8697	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlively scene in Hunsford Parsonage--the difference, the change was
  8698	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tso great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly
  8699	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trestrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company
  8700	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations
  8701	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tat Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from
  8702	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tself-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance
  8703	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcould result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the
  8704	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tacquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw
  8705	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdown the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and
  8706	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tRosings.
  8707	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8708	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tTheir visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they arose
  8709	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing
  8710	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttheir wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner
  8711	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tat Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a
  8712	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdiffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,
  8713	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treadily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing
  8714	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thow _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its
  8715	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tacceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming however,
  8716	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than
  8717	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tany dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of
  8718	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsociety, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for
  8719	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.
  8720	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8721	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth
  8722	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tagain, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to
  8723	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmake after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all
  8724	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthis into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased, and on
  8725	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthis account, as well as some others, found herself, when their
  8726	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvisitors left them, capable of considering the last half-hour with some
  8727	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsatisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been
  8728	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlittle. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her
  8729	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tuncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their
  8730	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfavourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.
  8731	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8732	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBut she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s curiosity; it was
  8733	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was
  8734	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmuch better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;
  8735	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to
  8736	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinterest, but nothing to justify inquiry.
  8737	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8738	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tOf Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far
  8739	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could
  8740	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character
  8741	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfrom their own feelings and his servant’s report, without any reference
  8742	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known
  8743	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twould not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,
  8744	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thowever, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible
  8745	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four
  8746	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyears old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be
  8747	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of
  8748	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttheir Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had
  8749	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not,
  8750	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town
  8751	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhere the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he
  8752	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.
  8753	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8754	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWith respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held
  8755	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthere in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the
  8756	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tson of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known
  8757	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind
  8758	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.
  8759	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8760	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAs for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than
  8761	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not
  8762	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlong enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion;
  8763	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out. She
  8764	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcertainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she
  8765	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,
  8766	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his
  8767	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvaluable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some
  8768	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttime ceased to be repugnant to her feeling; and it was now heightened
  8769	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinto somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in
  8770	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,
  8771	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhich yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,
  8772	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthere was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked.
  8773	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIt was gratitude; gratitude, not merely for having once loved her,
  8774	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbut for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and
  8775	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tacrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the unjust accusations
  8776	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taccompanying her rejection. He who, she had been persuaded, would avoid
  8777	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental meeting, most
  8778	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any indelicate display
  8779	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where their two selves only
  8780	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twere concerned, was soliciting the good opinion of her friends, and bent
  8781	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ton making her known to his sister. Such a change in a man of so much
  8782	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpride exciting not only astonishment but gratitude--for to love, ardent
  8783	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlove, it must be attributed; and as such its impression on her was of a
  8784	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsort to be encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be
  8785	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texactly defined. She respected, she esteemed, she was grateful to him,
  8786	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe felt a real interest in his welfare; and she only wanted to know how
  8787	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfar she wished that welfare to depend upon herself, and how far it would
  8788	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her
  8789	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on her the renewal of
  8790	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this addresses.
  8791	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8792	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIt had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece, that
  8793	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuch a striking civility as Miss Darcy’s in coming to see them on the
  8794	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvery day of her arrival at Pemberley, for she had reached it only to a
  8795	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlate breakfast, ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled,
  8796	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tby some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that
  8797	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following
  8798	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmorning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when
  8799	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.
  8800	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8801	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been
  8802	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trenewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting

  8808	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8809	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8810	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tConvinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley’s dislike of her had
  8811	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\toriginated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how unwelcome her
  8812	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tappearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know with how
  8813	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmuch civility on that lady’s side the acquaintance would now be renewed.
  8814	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8815	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tOn reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon,
  8816	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows
  8817	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\topening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody
  8818	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts
  8819	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhich were scattered over the intermediate lawn.
  8820	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8821	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIn this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there
  8822	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in
  8823	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLondon. Georgiana’s reception of them was very civil, but attended with
  8824	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tall the embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the fear
  8825	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior
  8826	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her niece,
  8827	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thowever, did her justice, and pitied her.
  8828	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8829	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBy Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey; and,
  8830	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ton their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,
  8831	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsucceeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a
  8832	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgenteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind
  8833	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the
  8834	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tothers; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from
  8835	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she
  8836	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a
  8837	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshort sentence when there was least danger of its being heard.
  8838	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8839	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,
  8840	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without
  8841	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcalling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her
  8842	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfrom trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an
  8843	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity
  8844	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof saying much. Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every
  8845	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmoment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she
  8846	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfeared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether
  8847	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After
  8848	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss
  8849	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBingley’s voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold
  8850	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal
  8851	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tindifference and brevity, and the other said no more.
  8852	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8853	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the
  8854	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tentrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the
  8855	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfinest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many
  8856	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been
  8857	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgiven, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole
  8858	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tparty--for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the
  8859	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches soon collected
  8860	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthem round the table.
  8861	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8862	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWhile thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether
  8863	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the
  8864	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfeelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but
  8865	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to
  8866	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tregret that he came.
  8867	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8868	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHe had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other
  8869	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him
  8870	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tonly on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to
  8871	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tGeorgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear than Elizabeth wisely
  8872	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tresolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more
  8873	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnecessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she
  8874	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsaw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,
  8875	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour
  8876	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhen he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive
  8877	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcuriosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley’s, in spite of the
  8878	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsmiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its
  8879	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tobjects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions
  8880	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother’s
  8881	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tentrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that he
  8882	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded
  8883	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss
  8884	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the
  8885	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfirst opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:
  8886	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8887	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire Militia removed from Meryton?
  8888	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThey must be a great loss to _your_ family.”
  8889	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8890	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIn Darcy’s presence she dared not mention Wickham’s name; but Elizabeth
  8891	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinstantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the
  8892	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvarious recollections connected with him gave her a moment’s distress;
  8893	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbut exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she
  8894	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpresently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone. While
  8895	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy, with a heightened
  8896	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcomplexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with
  8897	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconfusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what
  8898	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would
  8899	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thave refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose
  8900	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed
  8901	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in
  8902	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tDarcy’s opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies
  8903	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand absurdities by which some part of her family were connected
  8904	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy’s
  8905	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmeditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy
  8906	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley’s connections
  8907	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very
  8908	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming
  8909	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without
  8910	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmeaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss
  8911	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern
  8912	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor the welfare of his friend.
  8913	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8914	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth’s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and
  8915	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to
  8916	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able
  8917	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely
  8918	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trecollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which
  8919	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have
  8920	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfixed them on her more and more cheerfully.
  8921	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8922	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tTheir visit did not continue long after the question and answer above
  8923	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage Miss
  8924	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth’s person,
  8925	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbehaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her brother’s
  8926	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trecommendation was enough to ensure her favour; his judgement could not
  8927	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\terr. And he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana
  8928	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twithout the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When
  8929	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tDarcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to
  8930	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim some part of what she had been saying to his sister.
  8931	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8932	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,” she
  8933	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcried; “I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since
  8934	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing
  8935	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat we should not have known her again.”
  8936	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8937	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHowever little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented
  8938	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thimself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than
  8939	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence of travelling in the
  8940	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsummer.
  8941	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8942	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“For my own part,” she rejoined, “I must confess that I never could
  8943	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsee any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no
  8944	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbrilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose
  8945	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twants character--there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are
  8946	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes,
  8947	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhich have sometimes been called so fine, I could never see anything
  8948	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\textraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do
  8949	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot like at all; and in her air altogether there is a self-sufficiency
  8950	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twithout fashion, which is intolerable.”
  8951	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8952	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tPersuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not
  8953	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always
  8954	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the
  8955	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuccess she expected. He was resolutely silent, however, and, from a
  8956	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdetermination of making him speak, she continued:
  8957	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8958	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all
  8959	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twere to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect
  8960	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyour saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, ‘_She_
  8961	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit.’ But afterwards she
  8962	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tseemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at
  8963	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tone time.”
  8964	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8965	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes,” replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, “but _that_
  8966	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas only when I first saw her, for it is many months since I have
  8967	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconsidered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.”
  8968	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8969	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHe then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of
  8970	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thaving forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.
  8971	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8972	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their
  8973	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvisit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them
  8974	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tboth. The look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed,
  8975	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texcept of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked
  8976	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit--of everything but
  8977	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thimself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of
  8978	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece’s
  8979	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeginning the subject.

  8984	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8985	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8986	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from
  8987	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tJane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been
  8988	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trenewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but
  8989	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ton the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the
  8990	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treceipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that
  8991	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit had been missent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as
  8992	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tJane had written the direction remarkably ill.
  8993	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  8994	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThey had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and
  8995	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by
  8996	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthemselves. The one missent must first be attended to; it had been
  8997	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twritten five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their
  8998	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlittle parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;
  8999	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbut the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident
  9000	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tagitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:
  9001	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9002	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a
  9003	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmost unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you--be
  9004	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tassured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia.
  9005	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAn express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed,
  9006	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfrom Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland
  9007	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our
  9008	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsurprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am
  9009	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvery, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing
  9010	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.
  9011	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step
  9012	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t(and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is
  9013	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdisinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.
  9014	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tOur poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How
  9015	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthankful am I that we never let them know what has been said against
  9016	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim; we must forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about
  9017	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttwelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at
  9018	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have
  9019	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpassed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect
  9020	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of
  9021	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttheir intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor
  9022	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly
  9023	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tknow what I have written.”
  9024	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9025	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWithout allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing
  9026	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhat she felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the
  9027	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tother, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it
  9028	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.
  9029	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9030	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I
  9031	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my
  9032	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thead is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest
  9033	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you,
  9034	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham
  9035	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has
  9036	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttaken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone
  9037	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the
  9038	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tday before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia’s short
  9039	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tletter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna
  9040	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tGreen, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W.
  9041	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnever intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was
  9042	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trepeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B.
  9043	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tintending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham,
  9044	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbut no further; for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney
  9045	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcoach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that
  9046	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tis known after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road.
  9047	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI know not what to think. After making every possible inquiry on that
  9048	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tside London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing
  9049	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthem at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but
  9050	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twithout any success--no such people had been seen to pass through. With
  9051	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions
  9052	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto us in a manner most creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved
  9053	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame on them. Our
  9054	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdistress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe the
  9055	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tworst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make
  9056	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue
  9057	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttheir first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design against a
  9058	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyoung woman of Lydia’s connections, which is not likely, can I suppose
  9059	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther so lost to everything? Impossible! I grieve to find, however, that
  9060	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tColonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he shook his
  9061	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thead when I expressed my hopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to
  9062	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and keeps her room. Could she
  9063	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texert herself, it would be better; but this is not to be expected. And
  9064	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas to my father, I never in my life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has
  9065	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tanger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of
  9066	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconfidence, one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you
  9067	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thave been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the
  9068	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfirst shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not
  9069	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tso selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I
  9070	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttake up my pen again to do what I have just told you I would not; but
  9071	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcircumstances are such that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to
  9072	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcome here as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well,
  9073	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something
  9074	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmore to ask of the former. My father is going to London with Colonel
  9075	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tForster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do I am sure
  9076	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any
  9077	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmeasure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to
  9078	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence, my
  9079	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tuncle’s advice and assistance would be everything in the world; he will
  9080	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timmediately comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.”
  9081	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9082	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh! where, where is my uncle?” cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat
  9083	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing
  9084	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door it was
  9085	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\topened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and impetuous
  9086	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmanner made him start, and before he could recover himself to speak,
  9087	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia’s situation,
  9088	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thastily exclaimed, “I beg your pardon, but I must leave you. I must find
  9089	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not
  9090	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tan instant to lose.”
  9091	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9092	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Good God! what is the matter?” cried he, with more feeling than
  9093	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpoliteness; then recollecting himself, “I will not detain you a minute;
  9094	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbut let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are
  9095	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot well enough; you cannot go yourself.”
  9096	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9097	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her and she felt how
  9098	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlittle would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back
  9099	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless
  9100	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tan accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and
  9101	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmistress home instantly.
  9102	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9103	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tOn his quitting the room she sat down, unable to support herself, and
  9104	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlooking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,
  9105	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tor to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,
  9106	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give you
  9107	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpresent relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill.”
  9108	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9109	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“No, I thank you,” she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. “There
  9110	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tis nothing the matter with me. I am quite well; I am only distressed by
  9111	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsome dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.”
  9112	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9113	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could
  9114	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say
  9115	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsomething indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate
  9116	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsilence. At length she spoke again. “I have just had a letter from Jane,
  9117	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith such dreadful news. It cannot be concealed from anyone. My younger
  9118	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsister has left all her friends--has eloped; has thrown herself into
  9119	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe power of--of Mr. Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton.
  9120	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t_You_ know him too well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no
  9121	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconnections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for ever.”
  9122	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9123	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tDarcy was fixed in astonishment. “When I consider,” she added in a yet
  9124	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmore agitated voice, “that I might have prevented it! I, who knew what
  9125	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\the was. Had I but explained some part of it only--some part of what I
  9126	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlearnt, to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not
  9127	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thave happened. But it is all--all too late now.”
  9128	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9129	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I am grieved indeed,” cried Darcy; “grieved--shocked. But is it
  9130	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcertain--absolutely certain?”
  9131	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9132	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced
  9133	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\talmost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to
  9134	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tScotland.”
  9135	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9136	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?”
  9137	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9138	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle’s
  9139	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timmediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in half-an-hour. But
  9140	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnothing can be done--I know very well that nothing can be done. How is
  9141	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuch a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have
  9142	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!”
  9143	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9144	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tDarcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.
  9145	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9146	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character--Oh! had I known what
  9147	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too
  9148	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmuch. Wretched, wretched mistake!”
  9149	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9150	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tDarcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking
  9151	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tup and down the room in earnest meditation, his brow contracted, his air
  9152	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her
  9153	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpower was sinking; everything _must_ sink under such a proof of family
  9154	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tweakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither
  9155	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing
  9156	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconsolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It
  9157	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own
  9158	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved
  9159	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim, as now, when all love must be vain.
  9160	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9161	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBut self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia--the
  9162	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thumiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed
  9163	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tup every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,
  9164	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of
  9165	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tseveral minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by
  9166	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe voice of her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke
  9167	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcompassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, “I am afraid you have been
  9168	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlong desiring my absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my
  9169	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tstay, but real, though unavailing concern. Would to Heaven that anything
  9170	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcould be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to
  9171	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuch distress! But I will not torment you with vain wishes, which may
  9172	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tseem purposely to ask for your thanks. This unfortunate affair will, I
  9173	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfear, prevent my sister’s having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley
  9174	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto-day.”
  9175	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9176	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy. Say that
  9177	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\turgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as
  9178	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlong as it is possible, I know it cannot be long.”
  9179	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9180	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHe readily assured her of his secrecy; again expressed his sorrow for
  9181	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present
  9182	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only
  9183	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tone serious, parting look, went away.
  9184	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9185	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAs he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they
  9186	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshould ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as
  9187	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a
  9188	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tretrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full
  9189	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those
  9190	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfeelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would
  9191	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tformerly have rejoiced in its termination.
  9192	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9193	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIf gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth’s
  9194	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tchange of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if
  9195	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\totherwise--if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or
  9196	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on
  9197	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta first interview with its object, and even before two words have been
  9198	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given
  9199	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsomewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for Wickham,
  9200	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand that its ill success might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other
  9201	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tless interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him
  9202	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgo with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia’s infamy must
  9203	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tproduce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched
  9204	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbusiness. Never, since reading Jane’s second letter, had she entertained
  9205	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta hope of Wickham’s meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,
  9206	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcould flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least
  9207	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first
  9208	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tletter remained in her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that
  9209	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry
  9210	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared
  9211	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tincomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment
  9212	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas this she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose
  9213	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention
  9214	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue
  9215	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey.
  9216	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9217	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that
  9218	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia
  9219	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one
  9220	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tofficer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions
  9221	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\traised them in her opinion. Her affections had continually been
  9222	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfluctuating but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and
  9223	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh! how acutely did she now
  9224	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfeel it!
  9225	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9226	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to
  9227	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshare with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a
  9228	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfamily so deranged, a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and
  9229	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trequiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing
  9230	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcould be done for Lydia, her uncle’s interference seemed of the utmost
  9231	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timportance, and till he entered the room her impatience was severe. Mr.
  9232	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servant’s
  9233	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taccount that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them
  9234	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinstantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the cause of their
  9235	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsummons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the postscript
  9236	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof the last with trembling energy.--Though Lydia had never been a
  9237	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfavourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be deeply
  9238	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tafflicted. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the
  9239	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfirst exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner promised every
  9240	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tassistance in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked
  9241	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit,
  9242	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teverything relating to their journey was speedily settled. They were to
  9243	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe off as soon as possible. “But what is to be done about Pemberley?”
  9244	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t cried Mrs. Gardiner. “John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for
  9245	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tus; was it so?”
  9246	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9247	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.
  9248	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t_That_ is all settled.”
  9249	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9250	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“What is all settled?” repeated the other, as she ran into her room to
  9251	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tprepare. “And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real
  9252	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttruth? Oh, that I knew how it was!”
  9253	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9254	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBut wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her in the
  9255	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure
  9256	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was
  9257	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timpossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of
  9258	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbusiness as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to
  9259	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their
  9260	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.
  9261	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tGardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing
  9262	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tremained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of
  9263	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could
  9264	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thave supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.
  9265	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t

  9269	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9270	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9271	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,” said her uncle, as they
  9272	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdrove from the town; “and really, upon serious consideration, I am much
  9273	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmore inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does on the
  9274	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmatter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should
  9275	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tform such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or
  9276	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfriendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel’s family, that I
  9277	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tam strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends
  9278	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twould not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the
  9279	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tregiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is
  9280	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot adequate to the risk!”
  9281	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9282	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Do you really think so?” cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.
  9283	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9284	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Upon my word,” said Mrs. Gardiner, “I begin to be of your uncle’s
  9285	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\topinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and
  9286	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinterest, for him to be guilty of. I cannot think so very ill of
  9287	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWickham. Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe
  9288	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim capable of it?”
  9289	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9290	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Not, perhaps, of neglecting his own interest; but of every other
  9291	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tneglect I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I
  9292	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had been
  9293	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe case?”
  9294	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9295	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“In the first place,” replied Mr. Gardiner, “there is no absolute proof
  9296	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat they are not gone to Scotland.”
  9297	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9298	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such
  9299	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the
  9300	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBarnet road.”
  9301	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9302	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Well, then--supposing them to be in London. They may be there, though
  9303	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional purpose. It is
  9304	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it
  9305	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmight strike them that they could be more economically, though less
  9306	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texpeditiously, married in London than in Scotland.”
  9307	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9308	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their
  9309	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmarriage be private? Oh, no, no--this is not likely. His most particular
  9310	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfriend, you see by Jane’s account, was persuaded of his never intending
  9311	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He
  9312	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia--what attraction has she
  9313	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her sake,
  9314	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tforego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what
  9315	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trestraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a
  9316	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know
  9317	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your
  9318	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tother objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has
  9319	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tno brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father’s
  9320	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbehaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever
  9321	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tseemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would
  9322	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdo as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in
  9323	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuch a matter.”
  9324	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9325	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him
  9326	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage?”
  9327	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9328	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,” replied Elizabeth, with
  9329	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttears in her eyes, “that a sister’s sense of decency and virtue in such
  9330	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say.
  9331	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tPerhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young; she has never
  9332	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeen taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year,
  9333	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnay, for a twelvemonth--she has been given up to nothing but amusement
  9334	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle
  9335	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.
  9336	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tSince the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,
  9337	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tflirtation, and officers have been in her head. She has been doing
  9338	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teverything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject, to give
  9339	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgreater--what shall I call it? susceptibility to her feelings; which are
  9340	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnaturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm of
  9341	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tperson and address that can captivate a woman.”
  9342	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9343	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“But you see that Jane,” said her aunt, “does not think so very ill of
  9344	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWickham as to believe him capable of the attempt.”
  9345	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9346	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be
  9347	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttheir former conduct, that she would think capable of such an attempt,
  9348	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttill it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what
  9349	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every
  9350	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is
  9351	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas false and deceitful as he is insinuating.”
  9352	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9353	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And do you really know all this?” cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity
  9354	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.
  9355	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9356	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I do indeed,” replied Elizabeth, colouring. “I told you, the other day,
  9357	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you yourself, when last at
  9358	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLongbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved
  9359	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other
  9360	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcircumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to
  9361	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trelate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From
  9362	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhat he said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,
  9363	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He
  9364	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmust know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found
  9365	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther.”
  9366	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9367	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you
  9368	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand Jane seem so well to understand?”
  9369	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9370	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw
  9371	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tso much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was
  9372	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home, the ----shire
  9373	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight’s time. As that was the
  9374	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcase, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it
  9375	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnecessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could
  9376	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the
  9377	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tneighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown? And even when it was
  9378	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsettled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening
  9379	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther eyes to his character never occurred to me. That _she_ could be
  9380	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a
  9381	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconsequence as _this_ could ensue, you may easily believe, was far
  9382	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tenough from my thoughts.”
  9383	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9384	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I
  9385	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuppose, to believe them fond of each other?”
  9386	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9387	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either
  9388	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tside; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware
  9389	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away. When first
  9390	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\the entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all
  9391	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twere. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for
  9392	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe first two months; but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular
  9393	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tattention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and
  9394	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment,
  9395	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twho treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.”
  9396	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9397	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t                          * * * * *
  9398	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9399	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIt may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added
  9400	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject, by
  9401	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tits repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during
  9402	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe whole of the journey. From Elizabeth’s thoughts it was never absent.
  9403	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tFixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could find
  9404	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tno interval of ease or forgetfulness.
  9405	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9406	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThey travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one night
  9407	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ton the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day. It was a
  9408	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcomfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied
  9409	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tby long expectations.
  9410	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9411	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing
  9412	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ton the steps of the house as they entered the paddock; and, when the
  9413	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcarriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their
  9414	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfaces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of
  9415	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcapers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.
  9416	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9417	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty kiss,
  9418	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down from her
  9419	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmother’s apartment, immediately met her.
  9420	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9421	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the
  9422	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been
  9423	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\theard of the fugitives.
  9424	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9425	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Not yet,” replied Jane. “But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope
  9426	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teverything will be well.”
  9427	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9428	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Is my father in town?”
  9429	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9430	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.”
  9431	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9432	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And have you heard from him often?”
  9433	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9434	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“We have heard only twice. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday to say
  9435	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I
  9436	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tparticularly begged him to do. He merely added that he should not write
  9437	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tagain till he had something of importance to mention.”
  9438	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9439	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And my mother--how is she? How are you all?”
  9440	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9441	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly
  9442	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshaken. She is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you
  9443	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tall. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank
  9444	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHeaven, are quite well.”
  9445	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9446	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“But you--how are you?” cried Elizabeth. “You look pale. How much you
  9447	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmust have gone through!”
  9448	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9449	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHer sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their
  9450	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were
  9451	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tengaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach
  9452	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof the whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and
  9453	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.
  9454	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9455	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWhen they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth
  9456	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon
  9457	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfound that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of
  9458	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgood, however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet
  9459	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdeserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that
  9460	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tevery morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father,
  9461	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce their marriage.
  9462	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9463	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes’
  9464	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with
  9465	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous
  9466	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage;
  9467	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tblaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the
  9468	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\terrors of her daughter must principally be owing.
  9469	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9470	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“If I had been able,” said she, “to carry my point in going to Brighton,
  9471	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but poor dear Lydia
  9472	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out
  9473	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their
  9474	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tside, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been
  9475	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twell looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have the
  9476	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcharge of her; but I was overruled, as I always am. Poor dear child!
  9477	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAnd now here’s Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight Wickham,
  9478	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twherever he meets him and then he will be killed, and what is to become
  9479	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof us all? The Collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his
  9480	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgrave, and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what we
  9481	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshall do.”
  9482	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9483	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThey all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after
  9484	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgeneral assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her
  9485	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr.
  9486	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.
  9487	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9488	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Do not give way to useless alarm,” added he; “though it is right to be
  9489	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tprepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.
  9490	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIt is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more we
  9491	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmay gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married,
  9492	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as
  9493	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlost. As soon as I get to town I shall go to my brother, and make
  9494	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim come home with me to Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult
  9495	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttogether as to what is to be done.”
  9496	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9497	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh! my dear brother,” replied Mrs. Bennet, “that is exactly what I
  9498	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcould most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out,
  9499	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them
  9500	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmarry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but
  9501	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them,
  9502	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tafter they are married. And, above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting.
  9503	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tTell him what a dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out of my
  9504	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twits--and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me--such
  9505	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tspasms in my side and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that
  9506	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear Lydia not to
  9507	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgive any directions about her clothes till she has seen me, for she does
  9508	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how kind you are! I
  9509	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tknow you will contrive it all.”
  9510	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9511	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBut Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours
  9512	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well
  9513	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin her hopes as her fear; and after talking with her in this manner till
  9514	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdinner was on the table, they all left her to vent all her feelings on
  9515	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe housekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.
  9516	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9517	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThough her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real
  9518	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\toccasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to
  9519	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\toppose it, for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her
  9520	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it
  9521	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbetter that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could
  9522	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmost trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the
  9523	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsubject.
  9524	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9525	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIn the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been
  9526	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttoo busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance
  9527	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbefore. One came from her books, and the other from her toilette. The
  9528	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfaces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible
  9529	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger
  9530	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhich she had herself incurred in this business, had given more of
  9531	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was
  9532	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance
  9533	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table:
  9534	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9535	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of.
  9536	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBut we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of
  9537	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teach other the balm of sisterly consolation.”
  9538	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9539	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThen, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,
  9540	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful
  9541	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlesson: that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable; that one
  9542	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfalse step involves her in endless ruin; that her reputation is no less
  9543	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbrittle than it is beautiful; and that she cannot be too much guarded in
  9544	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.”
  9545	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9546	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed
  9547	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console herself with such
  9548	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tkind of moral extractions from the evil before them.
  9549	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9550	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIn the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for
  9551	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thalf-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of
  9552	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe opportunity of making any inquiries, which Jane was equally eager to
  9553	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsatisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel
  9554	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss
  9555	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued
  9556	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe subject, by saying, “But tell me all and everything about it which
  9557	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI have not already heard. Give me further particulars. What did Colonel
  9558	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tForster say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement
  9559	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttook place? They must have seen them together for ever.”
  9560	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9561	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,
  9562	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tespecially on Lydia’s side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so
  9563	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgrieved for him! His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He
  9564	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had
  9565	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tany idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension
  9566	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfirst got abroad, it hastened his journey.”
  9567	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9568	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of
  9569	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttheir intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?”
  9570	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9571	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes; but, when questioned by _him_, Denny denied knowing anything of
  9572	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttheir plans, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not
  9573	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trepeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, I am
  9574	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before.”
  9575	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9576	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a
  9577	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdoubt, I suppose, of their being really married?”
  9578	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9579	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I felt
  9580	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister’s happiness with him
  9581	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite
  9582	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tright. My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how
  9583	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural
  9584	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttriumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia’s last letter
  9585	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems, of their
  9586	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeing in love with each other, many weeks.”
  9587	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9588	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“But not before they went to Brighton?”
  9589	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9590	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“No, I believe not.”
  9591	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9592	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself? Does
  9593	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\the know his real character?”
  9594	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9595	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly
  9596	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdid. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant. And since this sad
  9597	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taffair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt;
  9598	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbut I hope this may be false.”
  9599	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9600	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,
  9601	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthis could not have happened!”
  9602	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9603	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Perhaps it would have been better,” replied her sister. “But to expose
  9604	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe former faults of any person without knowing what their present
  9605	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfeelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We acted with the best intentions.”
  9606	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9607	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia’s note to his
  9608	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twife?”
  9609	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9610	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“He brought it with him for us to see.”
  9611	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9612	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tJane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth. These
  9613	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twere the contents:
  9614	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9615	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“MY DEAR HARRIET,
  9616	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9617	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help
  9618	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlaughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am
  9619	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmissed. I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with who,
  9620	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world I
  9621	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlove, and he is an angel. I should never be happy without him, so think
  9622	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit no harm to be off. You need not send them word at Longbourn of my
  9623	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgoing, if you do not like it, for it will make the surprise the greater,
  9624	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhen I write to them and sign my name ‘Lydia Wickham.’ What a good joke
  9625	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit will be! I can hardly write for laughing. Pray make my excuses to
  9626	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tPratt for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with him to-night.
  9627	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tTell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all; and tell him I will
  9628	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure. I shall
  9629	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsend for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell
  9630	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tSally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are
  9631	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpacked up. Good-bye. Give my love to Colonel Forster. I hope you will
  9632	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdrink to our good journey.
  9633	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9634	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Your affectionate friend,

  9636	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“LYDIA BENNET.”
  9637	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9638	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!” cried Elizabeth when she had
  9639	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfinished it. “What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment!
  9640	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBut at least it shows that _she_ was serious on the subject of their
  9641	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tjourney. Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her
  9642	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tside a _scheme_ of infamy. My poor father! how he must have felt it!”
  9643	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9644	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for full ten
  9645	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tminutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in
  9646	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuch confusion!”
  9647	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9648	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh! Jane,” cried Elizabeth, “was there a servant belonging to it who
  9649	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdid not know the whole story before the end of the day?”
  9650	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9651	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I do not know. I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a time is
  9652	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvery difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to
  9653	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgive her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so
  9654	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmuch as I might have done! But the horror of what might possibly happen
  9655	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\talmost took from me my faculties.”
  9656	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9657	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Your attendance upon her has been too much for you. You do not look
  9658	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twell. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care and anxiety
  9659	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tupon yourself alone.”
  9660	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9661	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every
  9662	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either of them.
  9663	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tKitty is slight and delicate; and Mary studies so much, that her hours
  9664	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof repose should not be broken in on. My aunt Phillips came to Longbourn
  9665	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ton Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till
  9666	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThursday with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all. And
  9667	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to
  9668	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcondole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters’, if
  9669	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthey should be of use to us.”
  9670	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9671	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“She had better have stayed at home,” cried Elizabeth; “perhaps she
  9672	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t_meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see
  9673	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttoo little of one’s neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence
  9674	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinsufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied.”
  9675	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9676	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had
  9677	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tintended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.
  9678	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9679	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“He meant I believe,” replied Jane, “to go to Epsom, the place where
  9680	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthey last changed horses, see the postilions and try if anything could
  9681	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe made out from them. His principal object must be to discover the
  9682	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnumber of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It had come
  9683	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith a fare from London; and as he thought that the circumstance of a
  9684	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgentleman and lady’s removing from one carriage into another might
  9685	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe remarked he meant to make inquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhow
  9686	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdiscover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he
  9687	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdetermined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible
  9688	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto find out the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any
  9689	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tother designs that he had formed; but he was in such a hurry to be gone,
  9690	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand his spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had difficulty in finding
  9691	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tout even so much as this.”
  9692	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t

  9696	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9697	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9698	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next
  9699	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmorning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.
  9700	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHis family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and
  9701	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion.
  9702	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThey were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to
  9703	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsend; but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain. Mr.
  9704	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tGardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.
  9705	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9706	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWhen he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant
  9707	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinformation of what was going on, and their uncle promised, at parting,
  9708	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn, as soon as he could,
  9709	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only
  9710	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsecurity for her husband’s not being killed in a duel.
  9711	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9712	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few
  9713	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdays longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable
  9714	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto her nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a
  9715	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgreat comfort to them in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt also
  9716	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvisited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of
  9717	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcheering and heartening them up--though, as she never came without
  9718	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treporting some fresh instance of Wickham’s extravagance or irregularity,
  9719	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found
  9720	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthem.
  9721	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9722	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAll Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months
  9723	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbefore, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared to be in debt
  9724	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with
  9725	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman’s family.
  9726	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tEverybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world;
  9727	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the
  9728	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tappearance of his goodness. Elizabeth, though she did not credit above
  9729	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thalf of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of
  9730	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther sister’s ruin more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less
  9731	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come
  9732	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhen, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before entirely
  9733	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdespaired of, they must in all probability have gained some news of
  9734	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthem.
  9735	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9736	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his wife received a
  9737	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tletter from him; it told them that, on his arrival, he had immediately
  9738	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfound out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street;
  9739	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival,
  9740	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbut without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now
  9741	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdetermined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet
  9742	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first
  9743	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcoming to London, before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself
  9744	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdid not expect any success from this measure, but as his brother was
  9745	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added that Mr.
  9746	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London and promised
  9747	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto write again very soon. There was also a postscript to this effect:
  9748	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9749	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if
  9750	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpossible, from some of the young man’s intimates in the regiment,
  9751	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to
  9752	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tknow in what part of town he has now concealed himself. If there were
  9753	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tanyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a
  9754	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tclue as that, it might be of essential consequence. At present we have
  9755	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnothing to guide us. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in
  9756	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps,
  9757	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLizzy could tell us what relations he has now living, better than any
  9758	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tother person.”
  9759	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9760	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to her
  9761	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tauthority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any information
  9762	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved. She had never
  9763	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\theard of his having had any relations, except a father and mother, both
  9764	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof whom had been dead many years. It was possible, however, that some of
  9765	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this companions in the ----shire might be able to give more information;
  9766	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand though she was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application
  9767	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas a something to look forward to.
  9768	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9769	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tEvery day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious
  9770	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpart of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of letters
  9771	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas the grand object of every morning’s impatience. Through letters,
  9772	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated, and every
  9773	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsucceeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.
  9774	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9775	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBut before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for
  9776	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttheir father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane
  9777	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,
  9778	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his
  9779	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tletters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. It was as
  9780	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfollows:
  9781	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9782	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“MY DEAR SIR,
  9783	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9784	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation
  9785	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now
  9786	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from
  9787	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and myself
  9788	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family, in
  9789	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyour present distress, which must be of the bitterest kind, because
  9790	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tproceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No arguments shall be
  9791	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune--or that
  9792	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmay comfort you, under a circumstance that must be of all others the
  9793	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmost afflicting to a parent’s mind. The death of your daughter would
  9794	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thave been a blessing in comparison of this. And it is the more to
  9795	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte
  9796	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinforms me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has
  9797	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tproceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though, at the same time,
  9798	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think
  9799	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat her own disposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be
  9800	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tguilty of such an enormity, at so early an age. Howsoever that may be,
  9801	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou are grievously to be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined
  9802	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tby Mrs. Collins, but likewise by Lady Catherine and her daughter, to
  9803	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhom I have related the affair. They agree with me in apprehending that
  9804	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthis false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of
  9805	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tall the others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says,
  9806	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twill connect themselves with such a family? And this consideration leads
  9807	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tme moreover to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain event
  9808	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof last November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved
  9809	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me then advise you, dear sir, to
  9810	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconsole yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child
  9811	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfrom your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the fruits of her
  9812	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\town heinous offense.
  9813	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9814	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I am, dear sir, etc., etc.”
  9815	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9816	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from
  9817	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tColonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.
  9818	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIt was not known that Wickham had a single relationship with whom he
  9819	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tkept up any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one
  9820	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tliving. His former acquaintances had been numerous; but since he
  9821	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad been in the militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of
  9822	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tparticular friendship with any of them. There was no one, therefore,
  9823	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twho could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him. And in the
  9824	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twretched state of his own finances, there was a very powerful motive for
  9825	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsecrecy, in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydia’s relations, for
  9826	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a
  9827	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvery considerable amount. Colonel Forster believed that more than a
  9828	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton.
  9829	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHe owed a good deal in town, but his debts of honour were still more
  9830	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tformidable. Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars
  9831	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfrom the Longbourn family. Jane heard them with horror. “A gamester!”
  9832	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t she cried. “This is wholly unexpected. I had not an idea of it.”
  9833	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9834	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their
  9835	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfather at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered
  9836	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tspiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded
  9837	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto his brother-in-law’s entreaty that he would return to his family, and
  9838	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tleave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable
  9839	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did
  9840	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering
  9841	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhat her anxiety for his life had been before.
  9842	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9843	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“What, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?” she cried. “Sure he
  9844	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twill not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham,
  9845	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand make him marry her, if he comes away?”
  9846	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9847	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAs Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she
  9848	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand the children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet
  9849	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcame from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their
  9850	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tjourney, and brought its master back to Longbourn.
  9851	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9852	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her
  9853	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tDerbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world. His
  9854	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tname had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and
  9855	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of their
  9856	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeing followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing. Elizabeth had
  9857	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treceived none since her return that could come from Pemberley.
  9858	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9859	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for
  9860	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be
  9861	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfairly conjectured from _that_, though Elizabeth, who was by this time
  9862	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware
  9863	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of
  9864	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLydia’s infamy somewhat better. It would have spared her, she thought,
  9865	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tone sleepless night out of two.
  9866	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9867	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWhen Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual
  9868	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tphilosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in the
  9869	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thabit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him
  9870	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taway, and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of
  9871	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit.
  9872	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9873	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIt was not till the afternoon, when he had joined them at tea, that
  9874	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly
  9875	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texpressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, “Say
  9876	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnothing of that. Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing,
  9877	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand I ought to feel it.”
  9878	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9879	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You must not be too severe upon yourself,” replied Elizabeth.
  9880	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9881	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone
  9882	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have
  9883	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeen to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.
  9884	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIt will pass away soon enough.”
  9885	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9886	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Do you suppose them to be in London?”
  9887	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9888	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?”
  9889	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9890	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And Lydia used to want to go to London,” added Kitty.
  9891	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9892	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“She is happy then,” said her father drily; “and her residence there
  9893	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twill probably be of some duration.”
  9894	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9895	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThen after a short silence he continued:
  9896	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9897	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me
  9898	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlast May, which, considering the event, shows some greatness of mind.”
  9899	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9900	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThey were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother’s
  9901	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttea.
  9902	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9903	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“This is a parade,” he cried, “which does one good; it gives such an
  9904	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\telegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my
  9905	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlibrary, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as
  9906	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till Kitty runs away.”
  9907	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9908	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I am not going to run away, papa,” said Kitty fretfully. “If I should
  9909	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.”
  9910	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9911	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“_You_ go to Brighton. I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne
  9912	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and
  9913	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter into
  9914	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmy house again, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be
  9915	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tabsolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters.
  9916	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAnd you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have
  9917	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tspent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner.”
  9918	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9919	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tKitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry.
  9920	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9921	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Well, well,” said he, “do not make yourself unhappy. If you are a good
  9922	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgirl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of
  9923	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthem.”

  9928	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9929	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9930	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tTwo days after Mr. Bennet’s return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking
  9931	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttogether in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper
  9932	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcoming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their
  9933	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons,
  9934	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhen they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, “I beg your pardon,
  9935	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmadam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some
  9936	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgood news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.”
  9937	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9938	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town.”
  9939	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9940	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Dear madam,” cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, “don’t you know
  9941	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthere is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He has been here
  9942	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthis half-hour, and master has had a letter.”
  9943	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9944	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAway ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. They
  9945	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to the
  9946	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlibrary; their father was in neither; and they were on the point of
  9947	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tseeking him up stairs with their mother, when they were met by the
  9948	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbutler, who said:
  9949	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9950	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“If you are looking for my master, ma’am, he is walking towards the
  9951	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlittle copse.”
  9952	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9953	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tUpon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once
  9954	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmore, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately
  9955	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.
  9956	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9957	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tJane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as
  9958	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,
  9959	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcame up with him, and eagerly cried out:
  9960	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9961	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh, papa, what news--what news? Have you heard from my uncle?”
  9962	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9963	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes I have had a letter from him by express.”
  9964	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9965	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Well, and what news does it bring--good or bad?”
  9966	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9967	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“What is there of good to be expected?” said he, taking the letter from
  9968	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this pocket. “But perhaps you would like to read it.”
  9969	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9970	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up.
  9971	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9972	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Read it aloud,” said their father, “for I hardly know myself what it is
  9973	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tabout.”
  9974	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9975	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Gracechurch Street, Monday, August 2.
  9976	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9977	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“MY DEAR BROTHER,
  9978	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9979	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such as,
  9980	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tupon the whole, I hope it will give you satisfaction. Soon after you
  9981	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tleft me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of
  9982	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLondon they were. The particulars I reserve till we meet; it is enough
  9983	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto know they are discovered. I have seen them both--”
  9984	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9985	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Then it is as I always hoped,” cried Jane; “they are married!”
  9986	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9987	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth read on:
  9988	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
  9989	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I find there
  9990	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the
  9991	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tengagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will
  9992	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot be long before they are. All that is required of you is, to assure
  9993	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto your daughter, by settlement, her equal share of the five thousand
  9994	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and
  9995	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmy sister; and, moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her,
  9996	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tduring your life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions
  9997	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhich, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying with,
  9998	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by
  9999	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texpress, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. You
 10000	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twill easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham’s
 10001	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcircumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be.
 10002	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to say there
 10003	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twill be some little money, even when all his debts are discharged, to
 10004	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsettle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune. If, as I conclude
 10005	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twill be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name throughout
 10006	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe whole of this business, I will immediately give directions to

 10008	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsmallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore stay quiet at
 10009	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLongbourn, and depend on my diligence and care. Send back your answer as

 10012	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou will approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as
 10013	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tanything more is determined on. Yours, etc.,

 10016	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10017	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Is it possible?” cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. “Can it be
 10018	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpossible that he will marry her?”
 10019	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10020	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him,” said her
 10021	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsister. “My dear father, I congratulate you.”
 10022	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10023	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And have you answered the letter?” cried Elizabeth.
 10024	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10025	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“No; but it must be done soon.”
 10026	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10027	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMost earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he
 10028	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twrote.
 10029	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10030	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh! my dear father,” she cried, “come back and write immediately.
 10031	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tConsider how important every moment is in such a case.”
 10032	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10033	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Let me write for you,” said Jane, “if you dislike the trouble
 10034	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyourself.”
 10035	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10036	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I dislike it very much,” he replied; “but it must be done.”
 10037	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10038	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAnd so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house.
 10039	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10040	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And may I ask--” said Elizabeth; “but the terms, I suppose, must be
 10041	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcomplied with.”
 10042	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10043	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Complied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little.”
 10044	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10045	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man!”
 10046	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10047	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there
 10048	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tare two things that I want very much to know; one is, how much money
 10049	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyour uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how am I ever
 10050	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto pay him.”
 10051	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10052	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Money! My uncle!” cried Jane, “what do you mean, sir?”
 10053	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10054	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a
 10055	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttemptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am
 10056	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgone.”
 10057	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10058	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“That is very true,” said Elizabeth; “though it had not occurred to me
 10059	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbefore. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh!
 10060	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit must be my uncle’s doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has
 10061	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdistressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.”
 10062	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10063	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“No,” said her father; “Wickham’s a fool if he takes her with a farthing
 10064	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tless than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so ill of him,
 10065	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin the very beginning of our relationship.”
 10066	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10067	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be
 10068	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trepaid?”
 10069	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10070	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued
 10071	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsilent till they reached the house. Their father then went on to the
 10072	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlibrary to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.
 10073	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10074	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And they are really to be married!” cried Elizabeth, as soon as they
 10075	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twere by themselves. “How strange this is! And for _this_ we are to be
 10076	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,
 10077	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice. Oh, Lydia!”
 10078	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10079	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I comfort myself with thinking,” replied Jane, “that he certainly would
 10080	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind
 10081	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tuncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten
 10082	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. He has children
 10083	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof his own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten thousand
 10084	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpounds?”
 10085	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10086	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“If he were ever able to learn what Wickham’s debts have been,” said
 10087	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth, “and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall
 10088	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has
 10089	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never
 10090	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe requited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal
 10091	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tprotection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as
 10092	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyears of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is
 10093	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tactually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now,
 10094	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she
 10095	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfirst sees my aunt!”
 10096	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10097	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,” said
 10098	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tJane: “I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to
 10099	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmarry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of
 10100	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself
 10101	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthey will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in
 10102	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttime make their past imprudence forgotten.”
 10103	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10104	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Their conduct has been such,” replied Elizabeth, “as neither you, nor
 10105	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI, nor anybody can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it.”
 10106	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10107	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIt now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood
 10108	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tperfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library,
 10109	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttherefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make
 10110	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit known to her. He was writing and, without raising his head, coolly
 10111	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treplied:
 10112	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10113	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Just as you please.”
 10114	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10115	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“May we take my uncle’s letter to read to her?”
 10116	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10117	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Take whatever you like, and get away.”
 10118	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10119	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went up stairs
 10120	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttogether. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communication
 10121	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twould, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news,
 10122	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As
 10123	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsoon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner’s hope of Lydia’s being soon
 10124	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmarried, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its
 10125	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she
 10126	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter
 10127	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twould be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her
 10128	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfelicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.
 10129	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10130	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“My dear, dear Lydia!” she cried. “This is delightful indeed! She will
 10131	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe married! I shall see her again! She will be married at sixteen!
 10132	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMy good, kind brother! I knew how it would be. I knew he would manage
 10133	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teverything! How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the
 10134	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tclothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about
 10135	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthem directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him
 10136	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thow much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell,
 10137	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tKitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear
 10138	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLydia! How merry we shall be together when we meet!”
 10139	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10140	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHer eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of
 10141	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthese transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.
 10142	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tGardiner’s behaviour laid them all under.
 10143	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10144	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“For we must attribute this happy conclusion,” she added, “in a great
 10145	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmeasure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to
 10146	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tassist Mr. Wickham with money.”
 10147	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10148	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Well,” cried her mother, “it is all very right; who should do it but
 10149	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children
 10150	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmust have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have
 10151	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tever had anything from him, except a few presents. Well! I am so happy!
 10152	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIn a short time I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well
 10153	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit sounds! And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in
 10154	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuch a flutter, that I am sure I can’t write; so I will dictate, and
 10155	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou write for me. We will settle with your father about the money
 10156	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tafterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.”
 10157	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10158	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and
 10159	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had
 10160	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her
 10161	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfather was at leisure to be consulted. One day’s delay, she observed,
 10162	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twould be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite
 10163	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tso obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her head.
 10164	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10165	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I will go to Meryton,” said she, “as soon as I am dressed, and tell the
 10166	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgood, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call
 10167	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ton Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage.
 10168	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAn airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do
 10169	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tanything for you in Meryton? Oh! Here comes Hill! My dear Hill, have you
 10170	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\theard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall
 10171	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tall have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.”
 10172	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10173	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received her
 10174	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcongratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took
 10175	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trefuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.
 10176	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10177	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tPoor Lydia’s situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was
 10178	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tno worse, she had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in
 10179	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlooking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could
 10180	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe justly expected for her sister, in looking back to what they had
 10181	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfeared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they had
 10182	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgained.
 10183	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10184	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10185	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10186	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tChapter 50
 10187	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10188	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10189	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that,
 10190	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinstead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum for
 10191	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived
 10192	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that
 10193	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trespect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever
 10194	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof honour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of
 10195	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tprevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be
 10196	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther husband might then have rested in its proper place.
 10197	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10198	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHe was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone
 10199	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshould be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law, and he
 10200	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance,
 10201	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.
 10202	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10203	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWhen first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly
 10204	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tuseless, for, of course, they were to have a son. The son was to join
 10205	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow
 10206	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters
 10207	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuccessively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.
 10208	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBennet, for many years after Lydia’s birth, had been certain that he
 10209	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twould. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then
 10210	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttoo late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her
 10211	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thusband’s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their
 10212	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tincome.
 10213	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10214	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tFive thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and
 10215	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the
 10216	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlatter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with
 10217	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tregard to Lydia, at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet
 10218	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcould have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In
 10219	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tterms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother,
 10220	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthough expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect
 10221	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tapprobation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the
 10222	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tengagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed
 10223	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would
 10224	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present
 10225	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tarrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the
 10226	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket
 10227	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tallowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her
 10228	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthrough her mother’s hands, Lydia’s expenses had been very little within
 10229	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat sum.
 10230	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10231	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThat it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was
 10232	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tanother very welcome surprise; for his wish at present was to have as
 10233	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlittle trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports
 10234	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he
 10235	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnaturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon
 10236	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdispatched; for, though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick
 10237	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin its execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he
 10238	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas indebted to his brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any
 10239	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmessage to her.
 10240	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10241	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe good news spread quickly through the house, and with proportionate
 10242	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tspeed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent
 10243	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tphilosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage
 10244	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the
 10245	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thappiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant
 10246	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfarmhouse. But there was much to be talked of in marrying her; and the
 10247	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgood-natured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded before from
 10248	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tall the spiteful old ladies in Meryton lost but a little of their spirit
 10249	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin this change of circumstances, because with such an husband her misery
 10250	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas considered certain.
 10251	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10252	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIt was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on this
 10253	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thappy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in
 10254	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tspirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her
 10255	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttriumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object
 10256	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of
 10257	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taccomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those
 10258	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tattendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and
 10259	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tservants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a
 10260	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tproper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering
 10261	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhat their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and
 10262	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timportance.
 10263	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10264	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Haye Park might do,” said she, “if the Gouldings could quit it--or the
 10265	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgreat house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is
 10266	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttoo far off! I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for
 10267	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tPulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.”
 10268	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10269	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHer husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the
 10270	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tservants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her: “Mrs.
 10271	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your son and
 10272	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdaughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into _one_ house in this
 10273	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tneighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the
 10274	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timpudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.”
 10275	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10276	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tA long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm. It
 10277	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsoon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror,
 10278	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his
 10279	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdaughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of
 10280	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taffection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend
 10281	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable
 10282	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tresentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her
 10283	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmarriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could believe
 10284	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpossible. She was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new
 10285	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tclothes must reflect on her daughter’s nuptials, than to any sense of
 10286	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they
 10287	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttook place.
 10288	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10289	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of
 10290	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for
 10291	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the
 10292	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tproper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its
 10293	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the
 10294	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tspot.
 10295	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10296	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe had no fear of its spreading farther through his means. There were
 10297	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfew people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;
 10298	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbut, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge of a sister’s
 10299	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfrailty would have mortified her so much--not, however, from any fear
 10300	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof disadvantage from it individually to herself, for, at any rate,
 10301	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthere seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia’s marriage been
 10302	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconcluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that
 10303	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Darcy would connect himself with a family where, to every other
 10304	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tobjection, would now be added an alliance and relationship of the
 10305	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned.
 10306	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10307	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tFrom such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink. The
 10308	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his
 10309	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfeeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a
 10310	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tblow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she
 10311	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no
 10312	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlonger hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there
 10313	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tseemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that
 10314	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they
 10315	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshould meet.
 10316	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10317	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWhat a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the
 10318	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tproposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now
 10319	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thave been most gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she
 10320	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdoubted not, as the most generous of his sex; but while he was mortal,
 10321	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthere must be a triumph.
 10322	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10323	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in
 10324	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdisposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and
 10325	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttemper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It
 10326	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas an union that must have been to the advantage of both; by her ease
 10327	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved;
 10328	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand from his judgement, information, and knowledge of the world, she
 10329	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmust have received benefit of greater importance.
 10330	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10331	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBut no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what
 10332	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconnubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and
 10333	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tprecluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their
 10334	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfamily.
 10335	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10336	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHow Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence,
 10337	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could
 10338	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbelong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions
 10339	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twere stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.
 10340	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10341	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t                          * * * * *
 10342	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10343	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet’s
 10344	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tacknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurance of his eagerness to
 10345	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpromote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties
 10346	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal
 10347	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpurport of his letter was to inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved
 10348	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ton quitting the militia.
 10349	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10350	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“It was greatly my wish that he should do so,” he added, “as soon as
 10351	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, in
 10352	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconsidering the removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on
 10353	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this account and my niece’s. It is Mr. Wickham’s intention to go into
 10354	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe regulars; and among his former friends, there are still some who
 10355	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tare able and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an
 10356	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tensigncy in General ----‘s regiment, now quartered in the North. It
 10357	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tis an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He
 10358	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpromises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each
 10359	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thave a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have
 10360	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twritten to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements,
 10361	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham
 10362	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin and near Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment, for which I
 10363	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thave pledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying
 10364	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsimilar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin
 10365	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta list according to his information? He has given in all his debts; I
 10366	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions,
 10367	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand all will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment,
 10368	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs.
 10369	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tGardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she
 10370	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tleaves the South. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to
 10371	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou and her mother.--Yours, etc.,
 10372	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10373	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“E. GARDINER.”
 10374	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10375	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham’s removal
 10376	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfrom the ----shire as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But Mrs. Bennet
 10377	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas not so well pleased with it. Lydia’s being settled in the North,
 10378	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tjust when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company,
 10379	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in
 10380	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a
 10381	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted
 10382	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith everybody, and had so many favourites.
 10383	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10384	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,” said she, “it will be quite shocking
 10385	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she
 10386	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlikes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General ----‘s
 10387	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tregiment.”
 10388	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10389	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHis daughter’s request, for such it might be considered, of being
 10390	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tadmitted into her family again before she set off for the North,
 10391	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treceived at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth,
 10392	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twho agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister’s feelings and
 10393	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconsequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,
 10394	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\turged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her
 10395	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was
 10396	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tprevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their
 10397	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show
 10398	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the
 10399	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tNorth. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent
 10400	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as
 10401	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth was
 10402	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsurprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme, and
 10403	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would
 10404	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thave been the last object of her wishes.

 10409	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10410	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10411	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tTheir sister’s wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her
 10412	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tprobably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to
 10413	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmeet them at ----, and they were to return in it by dinner-time. Their
 10414	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tarrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets, and Jane more especially,
 10415	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twho gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had she
 10416	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeen the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister
 10417	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmust endure.
 10418	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10419	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThey came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive
 10420	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthem. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the carriage drove up to
 10421	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,
 10422	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tanxious, uneasy.
 10423	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10424	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLydia’s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and
 10425	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and
 10426	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twelcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with an affectionate smile,
 10427	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy with an
 10428	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\talacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.
 10429	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10430	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tTheir reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite
 10431	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tso cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely
 10432	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\topened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was
 10433	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tenough to provoke him. Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet
 10434	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas shocked. Lydia was Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy,
 10435	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand fearless. She turned from sister to sister, demanding their
 10436	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcongratulations; and when at length they all sat down, looked eagerly
 10437	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tround the room, took notice of some little alteration in it, and
 10438	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tobserved, with a laugh, that it was a great while since she had been
 10439	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthere.
 10440	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10441	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his manners
 10442	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twere always so pleasing, that had his character and his marriage been
 10443	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he
 10444	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tclaimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth had
 10445	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down,
 10446	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tresolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence
 10447	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof an impudent man. She blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of the
 10448	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttwo who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour.
 10449	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10450	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThere was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither
 10451	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near
 10452	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,
 10453	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her
 10454	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treplies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the
 10455	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tworld. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led
 10456	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvoluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for
 10457	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe world.
 10458	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10459	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Only think of its being three months,” she cried, “since I went away;
 10460	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things
 10461	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tenough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure
 10462	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I
 10463	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthought it would be very good fun if I was.”
 10464	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10465	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHer father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth looked
 10466	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texpressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of
 10467	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhich she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, “Oh! mamma, do the
 10468	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpeople hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was afraid they might not;
 10469	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was determined he
 10470	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshould know it, and so I let down the side-glass next to him, and took
 10471	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\toff my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that
 10472	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\the might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything.”
 10473	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10474	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the room;
 10475	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to
 10476	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe dining parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with
 10477	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tanxious parade, walk up to her mother’s right hand, and hear her say
 10478	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto her eldest sister, “Ah! Jane, I take your place now, and you must go
 10479	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlower, because I am a married woman.”
 10480	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10481	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIt was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment
 10482	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfrom which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good
 10483	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tspirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Phillips, the Lucases, and
 10484	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tall their other neighbours, and to hear herself called “Mrs. Wickham”
 10485	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to show her
 10486	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tring, and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.
 10487	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10488	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Well, mamma,” said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast
 10489	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\troom, “and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I
 10490	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tam sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they may have half
 10491	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmy good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the place to get
 10492	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thusbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go.”
 10493	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10494	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I don’t
 10495	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tat all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?”
 10496	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10497	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh, lord! yes;--there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all
 10498	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthings. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We
 10499	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some
 10500	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tballs, and I will take care to get good partners for them all.”
 10501	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10502	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I should like it beyond anything!” said her mother.
 10503	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10504	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters
 10505	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbehind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the
 10506	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twinter is over.”
 10507	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10508	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I thank you for my share of the favour,” said Elizabeth; “but I do not
 10509	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tparticularly like your way of getting husbands.”
 10510	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10511	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tTheir visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham
 10512	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad received his commission before he left London, and he was to join
 10513	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this regiment at the end of a fortnight.
 10514	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10515	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tNo one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and
 10516	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and
 10517	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thaving very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to
 10518	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tall; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did
 10519	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthink, than such as did not.
 10520	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10521	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWickham’s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected
 10522	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto find it; not equal to Lydia’s for him. She had scarcely needed her
 10523	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpresent observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that
 10524	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttheir elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather
 10525	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthan by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring
 10526	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain
 10527	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and
 10528	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tif that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity
 10529	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof having a companion.
 10530	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10531	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every
 10532	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\toccasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did every
 10533	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on
 10534	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe first of September, than any body else in the country.
 10535	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10536	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tOne morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two
 10537	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\telder sisters, she said to Elizabeth:
 10538	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10539	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe. You
 10540	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twere not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it. Are not you
 10541	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcurious to hear how it was managed?”
 10542	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10543	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“No really,” replied Elizabeth; “I think there cannot be too little said
 10544	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ton the subject.”
 10545	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10546	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were
 10547	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmarried, you know, at St. Clement’s, because Wickham’s lodgings were in
 10548	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven
 10549	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\to’clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others
 10550	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twere to meet us at the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was in
 10551	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuch a fuss! I was so afraid, you know, that something would happen to
 10552	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tput it off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was
 10553	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmy aunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as
 10554	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tif she was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in
 10555	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed
 10556	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto know whether he would be married in his blue coat.”
 10557	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10558	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never
 10559	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt
 10560	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twere horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you’ll believe
 10561	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tme, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a
 10562	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything. To be sure London was
 10563	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open. Well, and so
 10564	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tjust as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon
 10565	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbusiness to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once
 10566	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthey get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I
 10567	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdid not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we
 10568	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twere beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he
 10569	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcame back again in ten minutes’ time, and then we all set out. However,
 10570	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going, the
 10571	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.”
 10572	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10573	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Mr. Darcy!” repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.
 10574	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10575	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh, yes!--he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious
 10576	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tme! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised
 10577	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthem so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!”
 10578	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10579	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“If it was to be secret,” said Jane, “say not another word on the
 10580	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsubject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.”
 10581	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10582	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh! certainly,” said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; “we will
 10583	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\task you no questions.”
 10584	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10585	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Thank you,” said Lydia, “for if you did, I should certainly tell you
 10586	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tall, and then Wickham would be angry.”
 10587	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10588	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tOn such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her
 10589	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpower, by running away.
 10590	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10591	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBut to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least
 10592	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at
 10593	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther sister’s wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,
 10594	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhere he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.
 10595	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tConjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her
 10596	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbrain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as
 10597	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tplacing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She
 10598	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcould not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,
 10599	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what
 10600	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLydia had dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been
 10601	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tintended.
 10602	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10603	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You may readily comprehend,” she added, “what my curiosity must be
 10604	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto know how a person unconnected with any of us, and (comparatively
 10605	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tspeaking) a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such
 10606	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,
 10607	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems
 10608	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with
 10609	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tignorance.”
 10610	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10611	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Not that I _shall_, though,” she added to herself, as she finished
 10612	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe letter; “and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable
 10613	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmanner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it
 10614	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tout.”
 10615	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10616	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tJane’s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to
 10617	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad
 10618	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any
 10619	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsatisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante.

 10626	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as
 10627	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsoon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in possession of it
 10628	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthan, hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to
 10629	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to
 10630	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not
 10631	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcontain a denial.

 10633	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Gracechurch street, Sept. 6.
 10634	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10635	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“MY DEAR NIECE,
 10636	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10637	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole morning
 10638	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will not comprise
 10639	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhat I have to tell you. I must confess myself surprised by your
 10640	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tapplication; I did not expect it from _you_. Don’t think me angry,
 10641	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thowever, for I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined such
 10642	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinquiries to be necessary on _your_ side. If you do not choose to
 10643	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunderstand me, forgive my impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised
 10644	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas I am--and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned
 10645	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twould have allowed him to act as he has done. But if you are really
 10646	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinnocent and ignorant, I must be more explicit.
 10647	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10648	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most
 10649	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with him several
 10650	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thours. It was all over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so
 10651	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdreadfully racked as _yours_ seems to have been. He came to tell Mr.
 10652	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tGardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were,
 10653	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand that he had seen and talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly,
 10654	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLydia once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day
 10655	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tafter ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for
 10656	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthem. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to
 10657	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thimself that Wickham’s worthlessness had not been so well known as to
 10658	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmake it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide
 10659	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and
 10660	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconfessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private
 10661	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tactions open to the world. His character was to speak for itself. He
 10662	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcalled it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy
 10663	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tan evil which had been brought on by himself. If he _had another_
 10664	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmotive, I am sure it would never disgrace him. He had been some days
 10665	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin town, before he was able to discover them; but he had something to
 10666	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdirect his search, which was more than _we_ had; and the consciousness
 10667	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof this was another reason for his resolving to follow us.
 10668	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10669	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago
 10670	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgoverness to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause
 10671	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof disapprobation, though he did not say what. She then took a large
 10672	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thouse in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting
 10673	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with
 10674	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to
 10675	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttown. But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he
 10676	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and
 10677	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcorruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found.
 10678	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and had
 10679	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up
 10680	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttheir abode with her. At length, however, our kind friend procured the
 10681	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twished-for direction. They were in ---- street. He saw Wickham, and
 10682	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tafterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His first object with her, he
 10683	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tacknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful
 10684	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsituation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed
 10685	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ton to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But
 10686	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\the found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared
 10687	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear
 10688	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or
 10689	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tother, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her feelings,
 10690	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which,
 10691	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin his very first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had never
 10692	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeen _his_ design. He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment,
 10693	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ton account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and
 10694	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tscrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia’s flight on her
 10695	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\town folly alone. He meant to resign his commission immediately; and as
 10696	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it. He
 10697	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmust go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have
 10698	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnothing to live on.
 10699	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10700	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once. Though
 10701	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able
 10702	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by
 10703	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmarriage. But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still
 10704	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in
 10705	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsome other country. Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely
 10706	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto be proof against the temptation of immediate relief.
 10707	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10708	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“They met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of
 10709	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcourse wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be
 10710	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treasonable.
 10711	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10712	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Every thing being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy’s next step was to
 10713	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmake your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch
 10714	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tstreet the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not be
 10715	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tseen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father was
 10716	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tstill with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did not judge
 10717	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyour father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your
 10718	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tuncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the
 10719	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdeparture of the former. He did not leave his name, and till the next
 10720	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tday it was only known that a gentleman had called on business.
 10721	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10722	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at home,
 10723	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together.
 10724	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10725	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too. It was not all
 10726	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsettled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was sent off to
 10727	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLongbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that
 10728	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tobstinacy is the real defect of his character, after all. He has been
 10729	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taccused of many faults at different times, but _this_ is the true one.
 10730	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tNothing was to be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and
 10731	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI do not speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it), your
 10732	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tuncle would most readily have settled the whole.
 10733	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10734	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“They battled it together for a long time, which was more than either
 10735	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. But at last your uncle
 10736	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas forced to yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his
 10737	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tniece, was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,
 10738	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhich went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your letter
 10739	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthis morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation
 10740	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where
 10741	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane
 10742	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tat most.
 10743	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10744	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the young
 10745	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpeople. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to considerably
 10746	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmore than a thousand pounds, another thousand in addition to her own
 10747	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsettled upon _her_, and his commission purchased. The reason why all
 10748	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthis was to be done by him alone, was such as I have given above. It
 10749	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas owing to him, to his reserve and want of proper consideration, that
 10750	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWickham’s character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he
 10751	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad been received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth
 10752	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody’s_ reserve,
 10753	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcan be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this fine talking,
 10754	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmy dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would
 10755	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnever have yielded, if we had not given him credit for _another
 10756	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinterest_ in the affair.
 10757	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10758	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“When all this was resolved on, he returned again to his friends, who
 10759	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twere still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in
 10760	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLondon once more when the wedding took place, and all money matters were
 10761	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthen to receive the last finish.
 10762	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10763	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I believe I have now told you every thing. It is a relation which
 10764	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least it will not
 10765	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tafford you any displeasure. Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constant
 10766	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tadmission to the house. _He_ was exactly what he had been, when I
 10767	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tknew him in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was
 10768	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsatisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us, if I had not
 10769	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tperceived, by Jane’s letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming
 10770	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thome was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tell
 10771	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou can give you no fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most
 10772	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tserious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had
 10773	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdone, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she
 10774	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\theard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was
 10775	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and
 10776	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tJane, and for their sakes had patience with her.
 10777	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10778	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Mr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you,
 10779	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tattended the wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to leave
 10780	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttown again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my
 10781	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold
 10782	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tenough to say before) how much I like him. His behaviour to us has,
 10783	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire. His
 10784	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunderstanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little
 10785	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmore liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his wife may teach
 10786	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim. I thought him very sly;--he hardly ever mentioned your name. But
 10787	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tslyness seems the fashion.
 10788	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10789	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do not
 10790	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpunish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy
 10791	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttill I have been all round the park. A low phaeton, with a nice little
 10792	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpair of ponies, would be the very thing.
 10793	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10794	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“But I must write no more. The children have been wanting me this half
 10795	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thour.
 10796	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10797	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yours, very sincerely,
 10798	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10799	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“M. GARDINER.”
 10800	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10801	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,
 10802	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the
 10803	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgreatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had
 10804	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tproduced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister’s
 10805	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmatch, which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too
 10806	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgreat to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the
 10807	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true!
 10808	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHe had followed them purposely to town, he had taken on himself all
 10809	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe trouble and mortification attendant on such a research; in which
 10810	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsupplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and
 10811	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdespise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently meet, reason
 10812	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith, persuade, and finally bribe, the man whom he always most wished to
 10813	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tavoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce. He had
 10814	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdone all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem. Her
 10815	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\theart did whisper that he had done it for her. But it was a hope shortly
 10816	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tchecked by other considerations, and she soon felt that even her vanity
 10817	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas insufficient, when required to depend on his affection for her--for
 10818	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta woman who had already refused him--as able to overcome a sentiment so
 10819	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnatural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham. Brother-in-law
 10820	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection. He had,
 10821	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto be sure, done much. She was ashamed to think how much. But he had
 10822	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgiven a reason for his interference, which asked no extraordinary
 10823	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tstretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel he had been
 10824	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising it; and
 10825	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthough she would not place herself as his principal inducement, she
 10826	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcould, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality for her might assist
 10827	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially
 10828	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconcerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that they were
 10829	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunder obligations to a person who could never receive a return. They
 10830	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\towed the restoration of Lydia, her character, every thing, to him. Oh!
 10831	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thow heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever
 10832	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tencouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him. For
 10833	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\therself she was humbled; but she was proud of him. Proud that in a cause
 10834	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof compassion and honour, he had been able to get the better of himself.
 10835	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe read over her aunt’s commendation of him again and again. It
 10836	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even sensible of some
 10837	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly both she
 10838	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted
 10839	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbetween Mr. Darcy and herself.
 10840	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10841	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe was roused from her seat, and her reflections, by some one’s
 10842	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tapproach; and before she could strike into another path, she was
 10843	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tovertaken by Wickham.
 10844	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10845	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?” said he,
 10846	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas he joined her.
 10847	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10848	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You certainly do,” she replied with a smile; “but it does not follow
 10849	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat the interruption must be unwelcome.”
 10850	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10851	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I should be sorry indeed, if it were. We were always good friends; and
 10852	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnow we are better.”
 10853	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10854	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“True. Are the others coming out?”
 10855	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10856	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to
 10857	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMeryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, that
 10858	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou have actually seen Pemberley.”
 10859	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10860	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe replied in the affirmative.
 10861	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10862	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much
 10863	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the
 10864	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\told housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of
 10865	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tme. But of course she did not mention my name to you.”
 10866	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10867	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes, she did.”
 10868	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10869	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And what did she say?”
 10870	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10871	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned
 10872	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tout well. At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely
 10873	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmisrepresented.”
 10874	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10875	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Certainly,” he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had
 10876	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsilenced him; but he soon afterwards said:
 10877	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10878	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other
 10879	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tseveral times. I wonder what he can be doing there.”
 10880	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10881	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,” said
 10882	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth. “It must be something particular, to take him there at this
 10883	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttime of year.”
 10884	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10885	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I
 10886	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunderstood from the Gardiners that you had.”
 10887	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10888	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes; he introduced us to his sister.”
 10889	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10890	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And do you like her?”
 10891	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10892	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Very much.”
 10893	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10894	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year
 10895	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tor two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad
 10896	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou liked her. I hope she will turn out well.”
 10897	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10898	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.”
 10899	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10900	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Did you go by the village of Kympton?”
 10901	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10902	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I do not recollect that we did.”
 10903	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10904	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had. A
 10905	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmost delightful place!--Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited
 10906	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tme in every respect.”
 10907	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10908	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“How should you have liked making sermons?”
 10909	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10910	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty,
 10911	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to
 10912	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trepine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The
 10913	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tquiet, the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas
 10914	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof happiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the
 10915	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcircumstance, when you were in Kent?”
 10916	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10917	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I have heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was
 10918	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tleft you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.”
 10919	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10920	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You have. Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the
 10921	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfirst, you may remember.”
 10922	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10923	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not
 10924	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tso palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually
 10925	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdeclared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business
 10926	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad been compromised accordingly.”
 10927	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10928	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember
 10929	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhat I told you on that point, when first we talked of it.”
 10930	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10931	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThey were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast
 10932	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister’s sake, to provoke him,
 10933	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile:
 10934	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10935	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let
 10936	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tus quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one
 10937	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmind.”
 10938	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10939	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though
 10940	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\the hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.
 10941	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10942	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10943	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t

 10945	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10946	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10947	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he
 10948	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnever again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth,
 10949	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tby introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she
 10950	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad said enough to keep him quiet.
 10951	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10952	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe day of his and Lydia’s departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet was
 10953	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tforced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means
 10954	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tentered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to
 10955	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcontinue at least a twelvemonth.
 10956	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10957	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh! my dear Lydia,” she cried, “when shall we meet again?”
 10958	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10959	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh, lord! I don’t know. Not these two or three years, perhaps.”
 10960	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10961	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Write to me very often, my dear.”
 10962	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10963	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“As often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for
 10964	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twriting. My sisters may write to _me_. They will have nothing else to
 10965	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdo.”
 10966	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10967	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Wickham’s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife’s. He
 10968	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsmiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.
 10969	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10970	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“He is as fine a fellow,” said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of
 10971	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe house, “as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to
 10972	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tus all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas
 10973	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thimself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.”
 10974	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10975	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.
 10976	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10977	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I often think,” said she, “that there is nothing so bad as parting with
 10978	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tone’s friends. One seems so forlorn without them.”
 10979	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10980	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter,” said
 10981	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth. “It must make you better satisfied that your other four are
 10982	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsingle.”
 10983	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10984	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married,
 10985	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbut only because her husband’s regiment happens to be so far off. If
 10986	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.”
 10987	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10988	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBut the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly
 10989	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trelieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an
 10990	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tarticle of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper
 10991	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tat Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her
 10992	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmaster, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several
 10993	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tweeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and
 10994	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsmiled and shook her head by turns.
 10995	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 10996	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,” (for Mrs.
 10997	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tPhillips first brought her the news). “Well, so much the better. Not
 10998	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am
 10999	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsure _I_ never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome
 11000	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto come to Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what _may_ happen?
 11001	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBut that is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to
 11002	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmention a word about it. And so, is it quite certain he is coming?”
 11003	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11004	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You may depend on it,” replied the other, “for Mrs. Nicholls was in
 11005	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMeryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose
 11006	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true. He
 11007	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcomes down on Thursday at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was
 11008	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgoing to the butcher’s, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on
 11009	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.”
 11010	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11011	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMiss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing
 11012	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcolour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to
 11013	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said:
 11014	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11015	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present
 11016	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treport; and I know I appeared distressed. But don’t imagine it was from
 11017	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tany silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that
 11018	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI _should_ be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect
 11019	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tme either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes
 11020	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\talone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of
 11021	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t_myself_, but I dread other people’s remarks.”
 11022	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11023	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in
 11024	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tDerbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no
 11025	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tother view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial
 11026	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming
 11027	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthere _with_ his friend’s permission, or being bold enough to come
 11028	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twithout it.
 11029	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11030	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yet it is hard,” she sometimes thought, “that this poor man cannot
 11031	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcome to a house which he has legally hired, without raising all this
 11032	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tspeculation! I _will_ leave him to himself.”
 11033	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11034	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIn spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her
 11035	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfeelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily
 11036	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tperceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed,
 11037	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmore unequal, than she had often seen them.
 11038	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11039	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,
 11040	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tabout a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.
 11041	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11042	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “you
 11043	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twill wait on him of course.”
 11044	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11045	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I
 11046	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twent to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in
 11047	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnothing, and I will not be sent on a fool’s errand again.”
 11048	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11049	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHis wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention
 11050	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twould be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to
 11051	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tNetherfield.
 11052	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11053	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“‘Tis an etiquette I despise,” said he. “If he wants our society,
 11054	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlet him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend my hours
 11055	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back
 11056	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tagain.”
 11057	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11058	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait
 11059	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ton him. But, however, that shan’t prevent my asking him to dine here, I
 11060	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tam determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will
 11061	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmake thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for
 11062	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim.”
 11063	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11064	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tConsoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her
 11065	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thusband’s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her
 11066	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tneighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before
 11067	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t_they_ did. As the day of his arrival drew near,--
 11068	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11069	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,” said Jane to her sister. “It
 11070	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twould be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can
 11071	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well;
 11072	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbut she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she
 11073	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsays. Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!”
 11074	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11075	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I wish I could say anything to comfort you,” replied Elizabeth; “but it
 11076	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tis wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction
 11077	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have
 11078	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\talways so much.”
 11079	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11080	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,
 11081	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcontrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety
 11082	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could. She counted
 11083	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent;
 11084	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thopeless of seeing him before. But on the third morning after his
 11085	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tarrival in Hertfordshire, she saw him, from her dressing-room window,
 11086	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tenter the paddock and ride towards the house.
 11087	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11088	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHer daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely
 11089	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tkept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went
 11090	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto the window--she looked,--she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down
 11091	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tagain by her sister.
 11092	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11093	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“There is a gentleman with him, mamma,” said Kitty; “who can it be?”
 11094	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11095	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not
 11096	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tknow.”
 11097	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11098	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“La!” replied Kitty, “it looks just like that man that used to be with
 11099	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim before. Mr. what’s-his-name. That tall, proud man.”
 11100	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11101	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of
 11102	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Bingley’s will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must
 11103	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsay that I hate the very sight of him.”
 11104	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11105	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tJane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little
 11106	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness
 11107	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhich must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time
 11108	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tafter receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable
 11109	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tenough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their
 11110	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be
 11111	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcivil to him only as Mr. Bingley’s friend, without being heard by either
 11112	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be
 11113	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs.
 11114	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tGardiner’s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.
 11115	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tTo Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused,
 11116	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive
 11117	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinformation, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted
 11118	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an
 11119	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinterest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just as
 11120	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhat Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming--at his
 11121	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcoming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,
 11122	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered
 11123	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbehaviour in Derbyshire.
 11124	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11125	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a
 11126	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tminute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to
 11127	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and
 11128	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twishes must still be unshaken. But she would not be secure.
 11129	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11130	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Let me first see how he behaves,” said she; “it will then be early
 11131	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tenough for expectation.”
 11132	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11133	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to
 11134	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of
 11135	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther sister as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little
 11136	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpaler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the
 11137	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgentlemen’s appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with
 11138	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any
 11139	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsymptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.
 11140	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11141	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down
 11142	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tagain to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She
 11143	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious, as usual; and,
 11144	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as
 11145	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps he could not in her mother’s
 11146	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpresence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but
 11147	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot an improbable, conjecture.
 11148	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11149	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period
 11150	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsaw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs.
 11151	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed,
 11152	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tespecially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of
 11153	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther curtsey and address to his friend.
 11154	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11155	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth, particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter
 11156	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy,
 11157	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill
 11158	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tapplied.
 11159	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11160	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tDarcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a question
 11161	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhich she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely anything. He
 11162	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but
 11163	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends,
 11164	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhen he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed without
 11165	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist
 11166	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often
 11167	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfound him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but
 11168	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when
 11169	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthey last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry
 11170	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith herself for being so.
 11171	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11172	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Could I expect it to be otherwise!” said she. “Yet why did he come?”
 11173	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11174	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to
 11175	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim she had hardly courage to speak.
 11176	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11177	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe inquired after his sister, but could do no more.
 11178	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11179	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,” said Mrs. Bennet.
 11180	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11181	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHe readily agreed to it.
 11182	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11183	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People _did_ say
 11184	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope
 11185	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood,
 11186	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsince you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my
 11187	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\town daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have
 11188	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tseen it in the papers. It was in The Times and The Courier, I know;
 11189	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthough it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, ‘Lately,
 11190	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tGeorge Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,’ without there being a
 11191	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsyllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything.
 11192	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIt was my brother Gardiner’s drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to
 11193	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmake such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?”
 11194	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11195	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth
 11196	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could
 11197	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot tell.
 11198	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11199	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,”
 11200	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t continued her mother, “but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very
 11201	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thard to have her taken such a way from me. They are gone down to
 11202	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tNewcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay
 11203	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI do not know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have
 11204	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\theard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the
 11205	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tregulars. Thank Heaven! he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so
 11206	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmany as he deserves.”
 11207	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11208	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such
 11209	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmisery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her,
 11210	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thowever, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually
 11211	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdone before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in
 11212	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe country at present. A few weeks, he believed.
 11213	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11214	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,” said her mother,
 11215	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please on Mr.
 11216	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBennet’s manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and
 11217	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twill save all the best of the covies for you.”
 11218	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11219	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth’s misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious
 11220	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tattention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had
 11221	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tflattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be
 11222	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant, she felt
 11223	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for
 11224	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmoments of such painful confusion.
 11225	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11226	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“The first wish of my heart,” said she to herself, “is never more to
 11227	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe in company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure
 11228	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either
 11229	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tone or the other again!”
 11230	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11231	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tYet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no
 11232	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcompensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing
 11233	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thow much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her
 11234	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tformer lover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little;
 11235	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbut every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He
 11236	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfound her as handsome as she had been last year; as good natured, and
 11237	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas unaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no
 11238	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdifference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded
 11239	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat she talked as much as ever. But her mind was so busily engaged,
 11240	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat she did not always know when she was silent.
 11241	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11242	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWhen the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her
 11243	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tintended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at
 11244	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLongbourn in a few days time.
 11245	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11246	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,” she added, “for when
 11247	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with
 11248	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tus, as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure
 11249	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep
 11250	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyour engagement.”
 11251	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11252	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of
 11253	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this concern at having been prevented by business. They then went away.
 11254	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11255	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine
 11256	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthere that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did
 11257	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man
 11258	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ton whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and pride
 11259	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof one who had ten thousand a year.

 11265	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11266	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAs soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;
 11267	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tor in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects that
 11268	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmust deaden them more. Mr. Darcy’s behaviour astonished and vexed her.
 11269	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11270	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,” said she,
 11271	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“did he come at all?”
 11272	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11273	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.
 11274	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11275	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“He could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when
 11276	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\the was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If
 11277	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\the no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing, man! I will
 11278	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthink no more about him.”
 11279	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11280	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHer resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach
 11281	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which showed her
 11282	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbetter satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth.
 11283	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11284	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Now,” said she, “that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly
 11285	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teasy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by
 11286	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly
 11287	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tseen that, on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent
 11288	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tacquaintance.”
 11289	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11290	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes, very indifferent indeed,” said Elizabeth, laughingly. “Oh, Jane,
 11291	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttake care.”
 11292	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11293	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now?”
 11294	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11295	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with
 11296	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou as ever.”
 11297	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11298	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t                          * * * * *
 11299	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11300	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThey did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in
 11301	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good
 11302	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thumour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour’s visit, had
 11303	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trevived.
 11304	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11305	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tOn Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two
 11306	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twho were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality
 11307	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the
 11308	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take
 11309	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by
 11310	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore
 11311	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to
 11312	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was
 11313	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdecided. He placed himself by her.
 11314	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11315	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend.
 11316	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHe bore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that
 11317	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes
 11318	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlikewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing
 11319	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\talarm.
 11320	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11321	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHis behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as showed an
 11322	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tadmiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded
 11323	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane’s happiness, and his
 11324	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\town, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the
 11325	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconsequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It
 11326	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in
 11327	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tno cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table
 11328	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcould divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little
 11329	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuch a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to
 11330	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tadvantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but
 11331	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and
 11332	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcold was their manner whenever they did. Her mother’s ungraciousness,
 11333	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmade the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth’s mind;
 11334	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell
 11335	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the
 11336	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfamily.
 11337	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11338	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of
 11339	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away
 11340	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twithout enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than
 11341	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious
 11342	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the
 11343	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her
 11344	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tuncivil. She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all
 11345	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.
 11346	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11347	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“If he does not come to me, _then_,” said she, “I shall give him up for
 11348	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tever.”
 11349	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11350	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have
 11351	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tanswered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,
 11352	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhere Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,
 11353	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her
 11354	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhich would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen’s approaching, one of
 11355	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper:
 11356	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11357	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“The men shan’t come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them;
 11358	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdo we?”
 11359	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11360	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tDarcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with
 11361	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough
 11362	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself for
 11363	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeing so silly!
 11364	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11365	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to
 11366	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texpect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex, who would not
 11367	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tprotest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?
 11368	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThere is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!”
 11369	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11370	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup
 11371	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thimself; and she seized the opportunity of saying:
 11372	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11373	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Is your sister at Pemberley still?”
 11374	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11375	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes, she will remain there till Christmas.”
 11376	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11377	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?”
 11378	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11379	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough,
 11380	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthese three weeks.”
 11381	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11382	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse
 11383	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for
 11384	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsome minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady’s whispering
 11385	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto Elizabeth again, he walked away.
 11386	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11387	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWhen the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed, the ladies
 11388	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tall rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him,
 11389	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhen all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her
 11390	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmother’s rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated
 11391	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure.
 11392	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThey were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had
 11393	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side
 11394	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.
 11395	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11396	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to
 11397	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsupper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the
 11398	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tothers, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.
 11399	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11400	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Well girls,” said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, “What
 11401	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsay you to the day? I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well,
 11402	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The
 11403	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvenison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said they never saw so
 11404	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfat a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the
 11405	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLucases’ last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges
 11406	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twere remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French
 11407	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater
 11408	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And
 11409	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhat do you think she said besides? ‘Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her
 11410	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tat Netherfield at last.’ She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as good
 11411	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls,
 11412	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.”
 11413	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11414	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of
 11415	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBingley’s behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at
 11416	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlast; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy
 11417	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thumour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at
 11418	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.
 11419	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11420	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“It has been a very agreeable day,” said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. “The
 11421	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tparty seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we
 11422	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmay often meet again.”
 11423	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11424	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth smiled.
 11425	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11426	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me.
 11427	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an
 11428	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tagreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it. I am
 11429	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tperfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had
 11430	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tany design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed
 11431	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally
 11432	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpleasing, than any other man.”
 11433	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11434	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You are very cruel,” said her sister, “you will not let me smile, and
 11435	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tare provoking me to it every moment.”
 11436	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11437	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“How hard it is in some cases to be believed!”
 11438	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11439	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And how impossible in others!”
 11440	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11441	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I
 11442	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tacknowledge?”
 11443	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11444	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to
 11445	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinstruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive
 11446	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tme; and if you persist in indifference, do not make me your confidante.”

 11452	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11453	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tA few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His
 11454	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfriend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in
 11455	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tten days time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably
 11456	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgood spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many
 11457	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texpressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.
 11458	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11459	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Next time you call,” said she, “I hope we shall be more lucky.”
 11460	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11461	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHe should be particularly happy at any time, etc. etc.; and if she would
 11462	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgive him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.
 11463	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11464	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Can you come to-morrow?”
 11465	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11466	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tYes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was
 11467	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taccepted with alacrity.
 11468	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11469	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHe came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them
 11470	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter’s room, in her dressing
 11471	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgown, and with her hair half finished, crying out:
 11472	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11473	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come--Mr. Bingley is
 11474	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcome. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss
 11475	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss
 11476	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLizzy’s hair.”
 11477	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11478	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“We will be down as soon as we can,” said Jane; “but I dare say Kitty is
 11479	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tforwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago.”
 11480	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11481	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be quick!
 11482	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWhere is your sash, my dear?”
 11483	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11484	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBut when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down
 11485	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twithout one of her sisters.
 11486	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11487	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the
 11488	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tevening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his
 11489	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcustom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of
 11490	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at
 11491	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any
 11492	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timpression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last
 11493	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tKitty did, she very innocently said, “What is the matter mamma? What do
 11494	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou keep winking at me for? What am I to do?”
 11495	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11496	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you.” She then sat still
 11497	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfive minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she
 11498	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, “Come here, my love, I want to
 11499	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tspeak to you,” took her out of the room. Jane instantly gave a look
 11500	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tat Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her
 11501	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tentreaty that _she_ would not give in to it. In a few minutes, Mrs.
 11502	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBennet half-opened the door and called out:
 11503	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11504	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.”
 11505	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11506	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth was forced to go.
 11507	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11508	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“We may as well leave them by themselves you know;” said her mother, as
 11509	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsoon as she was in the hall. “Kitty and I are going up stairs to sit in
 11510	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmy dressing-room.”
 11511	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11512	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained
 11513	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tquietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned
 11514	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinto the drawing-room.
 11515	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11516	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Bennet’s schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was every
 11517	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter. His
 11518	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their
 11519	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tevening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the
 11520	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command
 11521	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof countenance particularly grateful to the daughter.
 11522	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11523	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHe scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went
 11524	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taway, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs.
 11525	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBennet’s means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.
 11526	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11527	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAfter this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed
 11528	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbetween the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in
 11529	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy
 11530	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treturned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably
 11531	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpersuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman’s
 11532	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconcurrence.
 11533	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11534	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent
 11535	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more
 11536	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tagreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption
 11537	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tor folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into
 11538	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsilence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the
 11539	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tother had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;
 11540	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand in the evening Mrs. Bennet’s invention was again at work to get
 11541	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tevery body away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter
 11542	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea;
 11543	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be
 11544	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twanted to counteract her mother’s schemes.
 11545	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11546	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBut on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she
 11547	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsaw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother
 11548	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she perceived her
 11549	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in
 11550	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tearnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of
 11551	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tboth, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other, would
 11552	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thave told it all. Their situation was awkward enough; but _hers_ she
 11553	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and
 11554	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as
 11555	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twell as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few
 11556	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twords to her sister, ran out of the room.
 11557	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11558	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tJane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give
 11559	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest
 11560	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\temotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.
 11561	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11562	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“‘Tis too much!” she added, “by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh!
 11563	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhy is not everybody as happy?”
 11564	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11565	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth’s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth,
 11566	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of
 11567	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tkindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not
 11568	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tallow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be
 11569	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsaid for the present.
 11570	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11571	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I must go instantly to my mother;” she cried. “I would not on any
 11572	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taccount trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it
 11573	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfrom anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh! Lizzy, to
 11574	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tknow that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear
 11575	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfamily! how shall I bear so much happiness!”
 11576	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11577	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the
 11578	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcard party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.
 11579	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11580	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease
 11581	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many
 11582	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tprevious months of suspense and vexation.
 11583	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11584	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And this,” said she, “is the end of all his friend’s anxious
 11585	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcircumspection! of all his sister’s falsehood and contrivance! the
 11586	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thappiest, wisest, most reasonable end!”
 11587	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11588	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIn a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her
 11589	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfather had been short and to the purpose.
 11590	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11591	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Where is your sister?” said he hastily, as he opened the door.
 11592	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11593	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“With my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say.”
 11594	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11595	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHe then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes
 11596	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed
 11597	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with
 11598	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgreat cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen
 11599	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane’s perfections;
 11600	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his
 11601	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texpectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for
 11602	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbasis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of
 11603	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tJane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and
 11604	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thimself.
 11605	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11606	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIt was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of
 11607	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMiss Bennet’s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as
 11608	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmade her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped
 11609	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent or
 11610	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tspeak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,
 11611	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthough she talked to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when
 11612	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed
 11613	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thow really happy he was.
 11614	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11615	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tNot a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their
 11616	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvisitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he
 11617	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tturned to his daughter, and said:
 11618	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11619	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.”
 11620	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11621	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tJane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his
 11622	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgoodness.
 11623	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11624	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You are a good girl;” he replied, “and I have great pleasure in
 11625	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your
 11626	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdoing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are
 11627	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teach of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so
 11628	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teasy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will
 11629	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\talways exceed your income.”
 11630	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11631	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be
 11632	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunpardonable in me.”
 11633	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11634	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,” cried his wife, “what are you
 11635	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttalking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely
 11636	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmore.” Then addressing her daughter, “Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so
 11637	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thappy! I am sure I shan’t get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it
 11638	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twould be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not
 11639	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when
 11640	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\the first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was
 11641	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat you should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest young man that
 11642	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tever was seen!”
 11643	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11644	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her
 11645	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfavourite child. At that moment, she cared for no other. Her younger
 11646	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness
 11647	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhich she might in future be able to dispense.
 11648	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11649	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty
 11650	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbegged very hard for a few balls there every winter.
 11651	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11652	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;
 11653	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcoming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after
 11654	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsupper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough
 11655	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdetested, had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself
 11656	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tobliged to accept.
 11657	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11658	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for
 11659	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhile he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else;
 11660	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbut she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours
 11661	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he
 11662	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\talways attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of
 11663	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of
 11664	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trelief.
 11665	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11666	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“He has made me so happy,” said she, one evening, “by telling me that he
 11667	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed
 11668	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit possible.”
 11669	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11670	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I suspected as much,” replied Elizabeth. “But how did he account for
 11671	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit?”
 11672	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11673	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“It must have been his sister’s doing. They were certainly no friends to
 11674	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have
 11675	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tchosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see,
 11676	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will
 11677	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlearn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we
 11678	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcan never be what we once were to each other.”
 11679	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11680	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“That is the most unforgiving speech,” said Elizabeth, “that I ever
 11681	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\theard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again
 11682	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe dupe of Miss Bingley’s pretended regard.”
 11683	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11684	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November,
 11685	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\the really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being
 11686	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tindifferent would have prevented his coming down again!”
 11687	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11688	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his
 11689	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmodesty.”
 11690	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11691	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThis naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and
 11692	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe little value he put on his own good qualities. Elizabeth was pleased
 11693	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend; for,
 11694	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthough Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she
 11695	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tknew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.
 11696	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11697	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!” cried
 11698	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tJane. “Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed
 11699	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tabove them all! If I could but see _you_ as happy! If there _were_ but
 11700	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuch another man for you!”
 11701	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11702	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as
 11703	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou. Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your
 11704	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thappiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very
 11705	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgood luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.”
 11706	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11707	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a
 11708	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsecret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Phillips,
 11709	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her
 11710	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tneighbours in Meryton.
 11711	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11712	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the
 11713	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tworld, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,
 11714	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthey had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.

 11719	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11720	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11721	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tOne morning, about a week after Bingley’s engagement with Jane had been
 11722	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tformed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the
 11723	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the
 11724	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up
 11725	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the
 11726	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tequipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses
 11727	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twere post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who
 11728	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpreceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that
 11729	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsomebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid
 11730	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the
 11731	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three
 11732	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcontinued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown
 11733	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\topen and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.
 11734	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11735	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThey were of course all intending to be surprised; but their
 11736	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tastonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.
 11737	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even
 11738	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinferior to what Elizabeth felt.
 11739	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11740	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no
 11741	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tother reply to Elizabeth’s salutation than a slight inclination of the
 11742	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thead, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her
 11743	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tname to her mother on her ladyship’s entrance, though no request of
 11744	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tintroduction had been made.
 11745	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11746	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such
 11747	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thigh importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting
 11748	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,
 11749	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11750	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your
 11751	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmother.”
 11752	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11753	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth replied very concisely that she was.
 11754	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11755	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters.”
 11756	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11757	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes, madam,” said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to Lady Catherine.
 11758	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all is lately married,
 11759	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man
 11760	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twho, I believe, will soon become a part of the family.”
 11761	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11762	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You have a very small park here,” returned Lady Catherine after a short
 11763	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsilence.
 11764	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11765	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I
 11766	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tassure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas’s.”
 11767	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11768	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in
 11769	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsummer; the windows are full west.”
 11770	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11771	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner, and then
 11772	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tadded:
 11773	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11774	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr. and
 11775	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Collins well.”
 11776	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11777	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last.”
 11778	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11779	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from
 11780	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCharlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no
 11781	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tletter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.
 11782	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11783	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some
 11784	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trefreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,
 11785	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdeclined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,
 11786	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11787	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness
 11788	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ton one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you
 11789	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twill favour me with your company.”
 11790	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11791	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Go, my dear,” cried her mother, “and show her ladyship about the
 11792	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdifferent walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.”
 11793	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11794	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol,
 11795	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tattended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the
 11796	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and
 11797	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdrawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent
 11798	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlooking rooms, walked on.
 11799	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11800	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHer carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her
 11801	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twaiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk
 11802	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for
 11803	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and
 11804	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdisagreeable.
 11805	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11806	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“How could I ever think her like her nephew?” said she, as she looked in
 11807	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther face.
 11808	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11809	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAs soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following
 11810	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmanner:--
 11811	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11812	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my
 11813	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tjourney hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I
 11814	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcome.”
 11815	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11816	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.
 11817	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11818	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to account
 11819	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor the honour of seeing you here.”
 11820	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11821	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Miss Bennet,” replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, “you ought to
 11822	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tknow, that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere _you_ may
 11823	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tchoose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character has ever been
 11824	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcelebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such
 11825	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmoment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most
 11826	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\talarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told that not only your
 11827	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that
 11828	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon
 11829	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tafterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I
 11830	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him
 11831	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tso much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved
 11832	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ton setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to
 11833	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou.”
 11834	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11835	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“If you believed it impossible to be true,” said Elizabeth, colouring
 11836	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith astonishment and disdain, “I wonder you took the trouble of coming
 11837	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tso far. What could your ladyship propose by it?”
 11838	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11839	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.”
 11840	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11841	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,” said Elizabeth
 11842	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcoolly, “will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report
 11843	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tis in existence.”
 11844	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11845	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“If! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been
 11846	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tindustriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a
 11847	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treport is spread abroad?”
 11848	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11849	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I never heard that it was.”
 11850	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11851	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And can you likewise declare, that there is no foundation for it?”
 11852	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11853	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. You may
 11854	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\task questions which I shall not choose to answer.”
 11855	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11856	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has
 11857	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\the, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?”
 11858	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11859	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.”
 11860	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11861	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his
 11862	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treason. But your arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,
 11863	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thave made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You
 11864	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmay have drawn him in.”
 11865	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11866	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.”
 11867	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11868	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such
 11869	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlanguage as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,
 11870	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.”
 11871	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11872	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“But you are not entitled to know mine; nor will such behaviour as this,
 11873	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tever induce me to be explicit.”
 11874	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11875	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the
 11876	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpresumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is
 11877	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tengaged to my daughter. Now what have you to say?”
 11878	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11879	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will
 11880	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmake an offer to me.”
 11881	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11882	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied:
 11883	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11884	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy,
 11885	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthey have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of
 11886	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t_his_ mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles, we planned
 11887	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would
 11888	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe accomplished in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of
 11889	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to
 11890	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his
 11891	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of
 11892	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpropriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from his earliest
 11893	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thours he was destined for his cousin?”
 11894	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11895	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is
 11896	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tno other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not
 11897	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to
 11898	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmarry Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the
 11899	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmarriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither
 11900	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tby honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make
 11901	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tanother choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?”
 11902	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11903	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. Yes,
 11904	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMiss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or
 11905	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfriends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will
 11906	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.
 11907	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tYour alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned
 11908	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tby any of us.”
 11909	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11910	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“These are heavy misfortunes,” replied Elizabeth. “But the wife of Mr.
 11911	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tDarcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily
 11912	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tattached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause
 11913	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto repine.”
 11914	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11915	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude
 11916	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that
 11917	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tscore? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came
 11918	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\there with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will
 11919	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI be dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person’s
 11920	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.”
 11921	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11922	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“_That_ will make your ladyship’s situation at present more pitiable;
 11923	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbut it will have no effect on me.”
 11924	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11925	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and my
 11926	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the maternal
 11927	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tside, from the same noble line; and, on the father’s, from respectable,
 11928	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thonourable, and ancient--though untitled--families. Their fortune on
 11929	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tboth sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of
 11930	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tevery member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them?
 11931	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections,
 11932	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tor fortune. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If you
 11933	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twere sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere in
 11934	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhich you have been brought up.”
 11935	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11936	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that
 11937	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman’s daughter; so far we are
 11938	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tequal.”
 11939	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11940	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“True. You _are_ a gentleman’s daughter. But who was your mother?
 11941	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWho are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their
 11942	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcondition.”
 11943	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11944	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Whatever my connections may be,” said Elizabeth, “if your nephew does
 11945	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot object to them, they can be nothing to _you_.”
 11946	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11947	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?”
 11948	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11949	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThough Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady
 11950	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCatherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a
 11951	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmoment’s deliberation:
 11952	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11953	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I am not.”
 11954	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11955	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLady Catherine seemed pleased.
 11956	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11957	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?”
 11958	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11959	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I will make no promise of the kind.”
 11960	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11961	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more
 11962	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that
 11963	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me the
 11964	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tassurance I require.”
 11965	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11966	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And I certainly _never_ shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into
 11967	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tanything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry
 11968	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyour daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make their
 11969	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmarriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to me, would
 11970	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmy refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin?
 11971	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAllow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have
 11972	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsupported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the
 11973	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tapplication was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my character, if
 11974	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these. How far your
 11975	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnephew might approve of your interference in his affairs, I cannot tell;
 11976	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbut you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg,
 11977	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttherefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject.”
 11978	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11979	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the
 11980	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tobjections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I am
 11981	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tno stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister’s infamous
 11982	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\telopement. I know it all; that the young man’s marrying her was a
 11983	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpatched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles. And is
 11984	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuch a girl to be my nephew’s sister? Is her husband, is the son of his
 11985	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlate father’s steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!--of what are
 11986	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?”
 11987	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11988	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You can now have nothing further to say,” she resentfully answered.
 11989	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You have insulted me in every possible method. I must beg to return to
 11990	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe house.”
 11991	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11992	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAnd she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned
 11993	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tback. Her ladyship was highly incensed.
 11994	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11995	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!
 11996	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tUnfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you
 11997	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmust disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?”
 11998	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 11999	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my sentiments.”
 12000	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12001	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You are then resolved to have him?”
 12002	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12003	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner,
 12004	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhich will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without
 12005	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.”
 12006	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12007	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the
 12008	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tclaims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him in
 12009	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.”
 12010	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12011	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,” replied Elizabeth, “have any
 12012	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpossible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either
 12013	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twould be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the
 12014	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tresentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former
 12015	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t_were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment’s
 12016	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconcern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in
 12017	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe scorn.”
 12018	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12019	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well.
 12020	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your
 12021	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you
 12022	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treasonable; but, depend upon it, I will carry my point.”
 12023	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12024	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIn this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of
 12025	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe carriage, when, turning hastily round, she added, “I take no leave
 12026	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your mother. You deserve
 12027	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tno such attention. I am most seriously displeased.”
 12028	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12029	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her
 12030	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She
 12031	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\theard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs. Her mother
 12032	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timpatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady
 12033	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCatherine would not come in again and rest herself.
 12034	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12035	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“She did not choose it,” said her daughter, “she would go.”
 12036	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12037	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously
 12038	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcivil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were
 12039	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twell. She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so, passing through
 12040	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMeryton, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she had
 12041	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?”
 12042	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12043	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to
 12044	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tacknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.
 12045	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t

 12050	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12051	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw
 12052	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she, for many
 12053	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thours, learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it
 12054	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tappeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings,
 12055	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.
 12056	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tDarcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report
 12057	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;
 12058	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttill she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,
 12059	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the
 12060	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texpectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply
 12061	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her
 12062	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours
 12063	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tat Lucas Lodge, therefore (for through their communication with the
 12064	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCollinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine), had
 12065	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tonly set that down as almost certain and immediate, which she had looked
 12066	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tforward to as possible at some future time.
 12067	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12068	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIn revolving Lady Catherine’s expressions, however, she could not help
 12069	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfeeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting
 12070	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to
 12071	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tprevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate
 12072	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tan application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar
 12073	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trepresentation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared
 12074	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his
 12075	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose
 12076	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it
 12077	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_,
 12078	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would
 12079	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taddress him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would
 12080	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tprobably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak
 12081	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.
 12082	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12083	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIf he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which had often
 12084	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tseemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might
 12085	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsettle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity
 12086	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady
 12087	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCatherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to
 12088	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.
 12089	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12090	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his
 12091	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfriend within a few days,” she added, “I shall know how to understand
 12092	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his
 12093	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconstancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might
 12094	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thave obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him
 12095	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tat all.”
 12096	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12097	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t                          * * * * *
 12098	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12099	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had
 12100	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeen, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same
 12101	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tkind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet’s curiosity; and
 12102	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.
 12103	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12104	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe next morning, as she was going downstairs, she was met by her
 12105	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfather, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.
 12106	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12107	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Lizzy,” said he, “I was going to look for you; come into my room.”
 12108	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12109	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to
 12110	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner
 12111	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconnected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it
 12112	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmight be from Lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the
 12113	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconsequent explanations.
 12114	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12115	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down. He
 12116	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthen said,
 12117	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12118	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me
 12119	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its
 12120	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcontents. I did not know before, that I had two daughters on the brink
 12121	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest.”
 12122	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12123	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe colour now rushed into Elizabeth’s cheeks in the instantaneous
 12124	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;
 12125	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained
 12126	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thimself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to
 12127	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\therself; when her father continued:
 12128	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12129	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters
 12130	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover the
 12131	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tname of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins.”
 12132	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12133	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“From Mr. Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?”
 12134	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12135	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Something very much to the purpose of course. He begins with
 12136	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcongratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of
 12137	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhich, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping
 12138	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLucases. I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says
 12139	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ton that point. What relates to yourself, is as follows: ‘Having thus
 12140	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\toffered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on
 12141	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthis happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another;
 12142	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter
 12143	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after
 12144	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate may
 12145	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in
 12146	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthis land.’
 12147	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12148	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this? ‘This young
 12149	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of
 12150	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive
 12151	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpatronage. Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin
 12152	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitate
 12153	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tclosure with this gentleman’s proposals, which, of course, you will be
 12154	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinclined to take immediate advantage of.’
 12155	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12156	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out:
 12157	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12158	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“‘My motive for cautioning you is as follows. We have reason to imagine
 12159	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with
 12160	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta friendly eye.’
 12161	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12162	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“_Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_
 12163	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsurprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man within
 12164	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie
 12165	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmore effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any
 12166	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twoman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at you in his
 12167	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlife! It is admirable!”
 12168	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12169	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth tried to join in her father’s pleasantry, but could only force
 12170	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tone most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so
 12171	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlittle agreeable to her.
 12172	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12173	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Are you not diverted?”
 12174	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12175	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh! yes. Pray read on.”
 12176	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12177	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“‘After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last
 12178	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnight, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she
 12179	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfelt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some
 12180	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfamily objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her
 12181	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconsent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty
 12182	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and
 12183	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run
 12184	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.’ Mr.
 12185	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCollins moreover adds, ‘I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia’s sad
 12186	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbusiness has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their
 12187	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tliving together before the marriage took place should be so generally
 12188	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tknown. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain
 12189	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfrom declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young
 12190	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcouple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an
 12191	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tencouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should
 12192	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvery strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them,
 12193	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas a Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their
 12194	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnames to be mentioned in your hearing.’ That is his notion of Christian
 12195	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tforgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte’s
 12196	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsituation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But, Lizzy, you
 12197	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlook as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be _missish_,
 12198	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For what do we
 12199	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlive, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our
 12200	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tturn?”
 12201	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12202	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh!” cried Elizabeth, “I am excessively diverted. But it is so
 12203	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tstrange!”
 12204	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12205	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yes--_that_ is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man
 12206	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_
 12207	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate
 12208	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twriting, I would not give up Mr. Collins’s correspondence for any
 12209	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconsideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving
 12210	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and
 12211	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine
 12212	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tabout this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?”
 12213	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12214	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tTo this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had
 12215	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeen asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by
 12216	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her
 12217	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfeelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh, when she
 12218	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twould rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by
 12219	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhat he said of Mr. Darcy’s indifference, and she could do nothing but
 12220	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of
 12221	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this seeing too little, she might have fancied too much.

 12225	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tChapter 58
 12226	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12227	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12228	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tInstead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as
 12229	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy
 12230	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twith him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine’s
 12231	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvisit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time
 12232	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat
 12233	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed
 12234	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttheir all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the
 12235	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thabit of walking; Mary could never spare time; but the remaining five
 12236	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tset off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others
 12237	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy
 12238	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twere to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty
 12239	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a
 12240	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdesperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same.
 12241	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12242	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThey walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon
 12243	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMaria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,
 12244	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhen Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone. Now was the
 12245	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmoment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was
 12246	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thigh, she immediately said:
 12247	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12248	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving
 12249	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trelief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be wounding yours. I
 12250	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcan no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my
 12251	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpoor sister. Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to
 12252	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tacknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest
 12253	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.”
 12254	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12255	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,” replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise
 12256	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand emotion, “that you have ever been informed of what may, in a
 12257	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs. Gardiner
 12258	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas so little to be trusted.”
 12259	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12260	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You must not blame my aunt. Lydia’s thoughtlessness first betrayed to
 12261	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tme that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could
 12262	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnot rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again,
 12263	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced
 12264	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the
 12265	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsake of discovering them.”
 12266	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12267	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“If you _will_ thank me,” he replied, “let it be for yourself alone.
 12268	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThat the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other
 12269	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your
 12270	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t_family_ owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thought
 12271	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tonly of _you_.”
 12272	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12273	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause,
 12274	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther companion added, “You are too generous to trifle with me. If your
 12275	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfeelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. _My_
 12276	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taffections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence
 12277	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tme on this subject for ever.”
 12278	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12279	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of
 12280	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not
 12281	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvery fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone
 12282	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tso material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make
 12283	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. The
 12284	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thappiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never
 12285	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfelt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as
 12286	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twarmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth
 12287	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeen able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the
 12288	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texpression of heartfelt delight, diffused over his face, became him;
 12289	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbut, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of
 12290	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfeelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his
 12291	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taffection every moment more valuable.
 12292	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12293	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThey walked on, without knowing in what direction. There was too much to
 12294	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She
 12295	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsoon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding
 12296	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto the efforts of his aunt, who did call on him in her return through
 12297	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLondon, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the
 12298	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsubstance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on
 12299	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tevery expression of the latter which, in her ladyship’s apprehension,
 12300	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpeculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance; in the belief that
 12301	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuch a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise
 12302	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfrom her nephew which she had refused to give. But, unluckily for her
 12303	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.
 12304	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12305	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“It taught me to hope,” said he, “as I had scarcely ever allowed myself
 12306	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain that,
 12307	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have
 12308	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tacknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly.”
 12309	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12310	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, “Yes, you know enough
 12311	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof my frankness to believe me capable of _that_. After abusing you so
 12312	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tabominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all
 12313	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyour relations.”
 12314	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12315	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your
 12316	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taccusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my
 12317	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbehaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was
 12318	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence.”
 12319	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12320	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that
 12321	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tevening,” said Elizabeth. “The conduct of neither, if strictly examined,
 12322	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twill be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved
 12323	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin civility.”
 12324	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12325	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I
 12326	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthen said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of
 12327	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your
 12328	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: ‘had you behaved in a
 12329	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmore gentlemanlike manner.’ Those were your words. You know not, you can
 12330	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tscarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some time,
 12331	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.”
 12332	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12333	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an
 12334	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\timpression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such
 12335	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta way.”
 12336	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12337	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper
 12338	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfeeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never
 12339	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tforget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible
 12340	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tway that would induce you to accept me.”
 12341	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12342	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at
 12343	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tall. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.”
 12344	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12345	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tDarcy mentioned his letter. “Did it,” said he, “did it soon make you
 12346	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthink better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its
 12347	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcontents?”
 12348	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12349	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her
 12350	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tformer prejudices had been removed.
 12351	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12352	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I knew,” said he, “that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was
 12353	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnecessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part
 12354	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tespecially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the
 12355	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpower of reading again. I can remember some expressions which might
 12356	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tjustly make you hate me.”
 12357	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12358	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the
 12359	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpreservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my
 12360	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\topinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily
 12361	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tchanged as that implies.”
 12362	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12363	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“When I wrote that letter,” replied Darcy, “I believed myself perfectly
 12364	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcalm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a
 12365	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdreadful bitterness of spirit.”
 12366	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12367	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The
 12368	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tadieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings
 12369	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now
 12370	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tso widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant
 12371	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcircumstance attending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some
 12372	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof my philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you
 12373	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpleasure.”
 12374	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12375	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. Your
 12376	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tretrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment
 12377	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tarising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of
 12378	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinnocence. But with me, it is not so. Painful recollections will intrude
 12379	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhich cannot, which ought not, to be repelled. I have been a selfish
 12380	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeing all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a child I
 12381	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas taught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I
 12382	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas given good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.
 12383	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tUnfortunately an only son (for many years an only child), I was spoilt
 12384	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tby my parents, who, though good themselves (my father, particularly, all
 12385	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat was benevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught
 12386	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tme to be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond my own family
 12387	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcircle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to wish at least
 12388	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I
 12389	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been
 12390	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbut for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You
 12391	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttaught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you,
 12392	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my reception.
 12393	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tYou showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman
 12394	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tworthy of being pleased.”
 12395	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12396	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?”
 12397	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12398	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be
 12399	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twishing, expecting my addresses.”
 12400	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12401	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure
 12402	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me
 12403	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twrong. How you must have hated me after _that_ evening?”
 12404	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12405	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take
 12406	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta proper direction.”
 12407	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12408	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met at
 12409	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tPemberley. You blamed me for coming?”
 12410	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12411	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.”
 12412	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12413	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.
 12414	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMy conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I
 12415	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconfess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due.”
 12416	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12417	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“My object then,” replied Darcy, “was to show you, by every civility in
 12418	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmy power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to
 12419	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tobtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you
 12420	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsee that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes
 12421	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tintroduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an
 12422	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thour after I had seen you.”
 12423	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12424	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHe then told her of Georgiana’s delight in her acquaintance, and of her
 12425	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdisappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to
 12426	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of
 12427	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfollowing her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed
 12428	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbefore he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness
 12429	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthere had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must
 12430	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcomprehend.
 12431	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12432	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tShe expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to
 12433	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teach, to be dwelt on farther.
 12434	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12435	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAfter walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know
 12436	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tanything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that
 12437	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit was time to be at home.
 12438	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12439	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!” was a wonder which
 12440	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tintroduced the discussion of their affairs. Darcy was delighted with
 12441	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttheir engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of
 12442	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit.
 12443	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12444	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I must ask whether you were surprised?” said Elizabeth.
 12445	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12446	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.”
 12447	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12448	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much.” And
 12449	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthough he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much
 12450	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe case.
 12451	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12452	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“On the evening before my going to London,” said he, “I made a
 12453	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconfession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I
 12454	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttold him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his
 12455	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taffairs absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never had
 12456	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed myself
 12457	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent
 12458	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was
 12459	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.”
 12460	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12461	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his
 12462	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfriend.
 12463	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12464	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Did you speak from your own observation,” said she, “when you told him
 12465	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?”
 12466	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12467	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“From the former. I had narrowly observed her during the two visits
 12468	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhich I had lately made here; and I was convinced of her affection.”
 12469	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12470	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to
 12471	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim.”
 12472	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12473	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had
 12474	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tprevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but
 12475	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this reliance on mine made every thing easy. I was obliged to confess
 12476	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tone thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not
 12477	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tallow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months
 12478	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlast winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was
 12479	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tangry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained
 12480	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin any doubt of your sister’s sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me
 12481	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnow.”
 12482	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12483	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful
 12484	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfriend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked
 12485	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\therself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at,
 12486	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand it was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness
 12487	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he
 12488	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcontinued the conversation till they reached the house. In the hall they
 12489	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tparted.
 12490	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12491	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12492	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12493	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tChapter 59
 12494	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12495	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12496	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?” was a question
 12497	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhich Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered their room,
 12498	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand from all the others when they sat down to table. She had only to
 12499	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsay in reply, that they had wandered about, till she was beyond her own
 12500	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tknowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything
 12501	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\telse, awakened a suspicion of the truth.
 12502	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12503	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. The
 12504	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tacknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.
 12505	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tDarcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;
 12506	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy
 12507	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthan _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,
 12508	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthere were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt
 12509	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no
 12510	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tone liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a
 12511	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.
 12512	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12513	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAt night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far
 12514	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfrom Miss Bennet’s general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.
 12515	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12516	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!--engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no,
 12517	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible.”
 12518	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12519	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and
 12520	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I am
 12521	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we are
 12522	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tengaged.”
 12523	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12524	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tJane looked at her doubtingly. “Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much
 12525	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou dislike him.”
 12526	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12527	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot. Perhaps I
 12528	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdid not always love him so well as I do now. But in such cases as
 12529	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthese, a good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever
 12530	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tremember it myself.”
 12531	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12532	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMiss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more
 12533	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tseriously assured her of its truth.
 12534	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12535	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you,” cried
 12536	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tJane. “My dear, dear Lizzy, I would--I do congratulate you--but are you
 12537	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcertain? forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be
 12538	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thappy with him?”
 12539	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12540	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already, that
 12541	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twe are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased,
 12542	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tJane? Shall you like to have such a brother?”
 12543	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12544	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more
 12545	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdelight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you
 12546	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treally love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather than
 12547	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmarry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought
 12548	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto do?”
 12549	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12550	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when I
 12551	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttell you all.”
 12552	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12553	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“What do you mean?”
 12554	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12555	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am
 12556	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tafraid you will be angry.”
 12557	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12558	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“My dearest sister, now _be_ serious. I want to talk very seriously. Let
 12559	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tme know every thing that I am to know, without delay. Will you tell me
 12560	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thow long you have loved him?”
 12561	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12562	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began.
 12563	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBut I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds
 12564	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tat Pemberley.”
 12565	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12566	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAnother entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the
 12567	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdesired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances
 12568	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing
 12569	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfurther to wish.
 12570	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12571	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Now I am quite happy,” said she, “for you will be as happy as myself.
 12572	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you,
 12573	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley’s friend and your
 12574	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thusband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But
 12575	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you
 12576	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know
 12577	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof it to another, not to you.”
 12578	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12579	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling
 12580	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made
 12581	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther equally avoid the name of his friend. But now she would no longer
 12582	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconceal from her his share in Lydia’s marriage. All was acknowledged,
 12583	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand half the night spent in conversation.
 12584	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12585	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t                          * * * * *
 12586	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12587	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Good gracious!” cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next
 12588	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmorning, “if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with
 12589	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tour dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always
 12590	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcoming here? I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or
 12591	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tother, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him?
 12592	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley’s
 12593	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tway.”
 12594	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12595	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet
 12596	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an
 12597	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tepithet.
 12598	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12599	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAs soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and
 12600	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;
 12601	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand he soon afterwards said aloud, “Mrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes
 12602	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?”
 12603	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12604	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,” said Mrs. Bennet, “to walk
 12605	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has
 12606	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tnever seen the view.”
 12607	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12608	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“It may do very well for the others,” replied Mr. Bingley; “but I am
 12609	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsure it will be too much for Kitty. Won’t it, Kitty?” Kitty owned that
 12610	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great curiosity to see
 12611	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently consented. As she went
 12612	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tup stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying:
 12613	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12614	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that
 12615	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdisagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not mind it: it is
 12616	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tall for Jane’s sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking
 12617	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto him, except just now and then. So, do not put yourself to
 12618	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinconvenience.”
 12619	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12620	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tDuring their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet’s consent should be
 12621	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tasked in the course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved to herself the
 12622	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tapplication for her mother’s. She could not determine how her mother
 12623	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twould take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur
 12624	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twould be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man. But whether she
 12625	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twere violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it
 12626	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit
 12627	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear
 12628	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her
 12629	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdisapprobation.
 12630	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12631	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t                          * * * * *
 12632	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12633	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIn the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw
 12634	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was
 12635	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\textreme. She did not fear her father’s opposition, but he was going to
 12636	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe made unhappy; and that it should be through her means--that _she_,
 12637	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be
 12638	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfilling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her--was a wretched
 12639	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when,
 12640	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlooking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes
 12641	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\the approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while
 12642	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpretending to admire her work said in a whisper, “Go to your father, he
 12643	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twants you in the library.” She was gone directly.
 12644	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12645	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHer father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.
 12646	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Lizzy,” said he, “what are you doing? Are you out of your senses, to be
 12647	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taccepting this man? Have not you always hated him?”
 12648	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12649	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHow earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more
 12650	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from
 12651	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\texplanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;
 12652	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbut they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion,
 12653	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof her attachment to Mr. Darcy.
 12654	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12655	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be
 12656	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.
 12657	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBut will they make you happy?”
 12658	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12659	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Have you any other objection,” said Elizabeth, “than your belief of my
 12660	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tindifference?”
 12661	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12662	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but
 12663	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthis would be nothing if you really liked him.”
 12664	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12665	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I do, I do like him,” she replied, with tears in her eyes, “I love him.
 12666	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tIndeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not
 12667	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tknow what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in
 12668	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuch terms.”
 12669	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12670	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Lizzy,” said her father, “I have given him my consent. He is the kind
 12671	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which he
 12672	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcondescended to ask. I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on
 12673	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thaving him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know
 12674	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyour disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor
 12675	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trespectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked
 12676	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tup to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the
 12677	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgreatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape
 12678	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdiscredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing
 12679	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t_you_ unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are
 12680	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tabout.”
 12681	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12682	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and
 12683	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tat length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the object
 12684	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of
 12685	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection
 12686	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months’
 12687	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsuspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did
 12688	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconquer her father’s incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.
 12689	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12690	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Well, my dear,” said he, when she ceased speaking, “I have no more to
 12691	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsay. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with
 12692	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.”
 12693	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12694	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tTo complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy
 12695	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.
 12696	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12697	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every thing;
 12698	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmade up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow’s debts, and got him
 12699	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble
 12700	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand economy. Had it been your uncle’s doing, I must and _would_ have
 12701	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpaid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own
 12702	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tway. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about
 12703	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\this love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.”
 12704	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12705	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHe then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading
 12706	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Collins’s letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her
 12707	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tat last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, “If any young men come
 12708	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.”
 12709	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12710	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth’s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after
 12711	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thalf an hour’s quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join
 12712	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe others with tolerable composure. Every thing was too recent for
 12713	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer
 12714	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tanything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity
 12715	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twould come in time.
 12716	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12717	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWhen her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,
 12718	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand made the important communication. Its effect was most extraordinary;
 12719	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to
 12720	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tutter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes that she could
 12721	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcomprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to credit
 12722	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhat was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a
 12723	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in
 12724	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.
 12725	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12726	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would
 12727	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thave thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich
 12728	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages
 12729	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou will have! Jane’s is nothing to it--nothing at all. I am so
 12730	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpleased--so happy. Such a charming man!--so handsome! so tall!--Oh, my
 12731	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before. I
 12732	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing
 12733	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh,
 12734	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLord! What will become of me. I shall go distracted.”
 12735	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12736	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThis was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and
 12737	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,
 12738	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsoon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room,
 12739	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther mother followed her.
 12740	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12741	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“My dearest child,” she cried, “I can think of nothing else! Ten
 12742	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthousand a year, and very likely more! ‘Tis as good as a Lord! And a
 12743	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tspecial licence. You must and shall be married by a special licence. But
 12744	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmy dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of,
 12745	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthat I may have it to-morrow.”
 12746	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12747	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThis was a sad omen of what her mother’s behaviour to the gentleman
 12748	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thimself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the certain
 12749	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpossession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations’
 12750	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tconsent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow
 12751	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpassed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood
 12752	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin such awe of her intended son-in-law that she ventured not to speak to
 12753	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her
 12754	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdeference for his opinion.
 12755	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12756	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get
 12757	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tacquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising
 12758	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tevery hour in his esteem.
 12759	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12760	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,” said he. “Wickham, perhaps,
 12761	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tis my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well
 12762	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tas Jane’s.”

 12768	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12769	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth’s spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr.
 12770	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tDarcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. “How could
 12771	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou begin?” said she. “I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when
 12772	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first
 12773	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tplace?”
 12774	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12775	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which
 12776	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlaid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I
 12777	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tknew that I _had_ begun.”
 12778	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12779	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour
 12780	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke
 12781	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now be sincere;
 12782	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdid you admire me for my impertinence?”
 12783	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12784	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“For the liveliness of your mind, I did.”
 12785	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12786	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less.
 12787	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious
 12788	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tattention. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking,
 12789	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone. I roused, and
 12790	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinterested you, because I was so unlike _them_. Had you not been really
 12791	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tamiable, you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you
 12792	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttook to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and
 12793	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously
 12794	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcourted you. There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for
 12795	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly
 12796	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treasonable. To be sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks
 12797	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof _that_ when they fall in love.”
 12798	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12799	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while she was
 12800	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\till at Netherfield?”
 12801	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12802	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a virtue of it
 12803	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tby all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are
 12804	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me
 12805	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may
 12806	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling
 12807	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto come to the point at last. What made you so shy of me, when you first
 12808	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcalled, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did
 12809	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou look as if you did not care about me?”
 12810	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12811	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.”
 12812	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12813	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“But I was embarrassed.”
 12814	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12815	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And so was I.”
 12816	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12817	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.”
 12818	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12819	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“A man who had felt less, might.”
 12820	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12821	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that
 12822	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you
 12823	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t_would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder when
 12824	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyou _would_ have spoken, if I had not asked you! My resolution of
 12825	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect.
 12826	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t_Too much_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort
 12827	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsprings from a breach of promise? for I ought not to have mentioned the
 12828	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsubject. This will never do.”
 12829	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12830	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly fair. Lady
 12831	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCatherine’s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of
 12832	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tremoving all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present happiness to
 12833	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tyour eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour
 12834	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto wait for any opening of yours. My aunt’s intelligence had given me
 12835	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thope, and I was determined at once to know every thing.”
 12836	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12837	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,
 12838	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come down to
 12839	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tNetherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?
 12840	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tor had you intended any more serious consequence?”
 12841	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12842	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I
 12843	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmight ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or what I avowed to
 12844	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmyself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley,
 12845	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made.”
 12846	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12847	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to
 12848	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbefall her?”
 12849	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12850	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I am more likely to want more time than courage, Elizabeth. But it
 12851	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be
 12852	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdone directly.”
 12853	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12854	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you and
 12855	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tadmire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did. But
 12856	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.”
 12857	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12858	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tFrom an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy
 12859	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thad been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner’s
 12860	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlong letter; but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would
 12861	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and
 12862	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as
 12863	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfollows:
 12864	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12865	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done,
 12866	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but to say the
 12867	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttruth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than really existed.
 12868	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBut _now_ suppose as much as you choose; give a loose rein to your
 12869	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfancy, indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the
 12870	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsubject will afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you
 12871	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tcannot greatly err. You must write again very soon, and praise him a
 12872	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgreat deal more than you did in your last. I thank you, again and again,
 12873	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfor not going to the Lakes. How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your
 12874	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tidea of the ponies is delightful. We will go round the Park every day. I
 12875	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tam the happiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so
 12876	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbefore, but not one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she
 12877	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tonly smiles, I laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that
 12878	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\the can spare from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.
 12879	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tYours, etc.”
 12880	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12881	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Darcy’s letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style; and still
 12882	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdifferent from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in reply
 12883	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto his last.
 12884	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12885	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“DEAR SIR,
 12886	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12887	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will soon
 12888	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as you can.
 12889	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBut, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has more to give.
 12890	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12891	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yours sincerely, etc.”
 12892	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12893	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMiss Bingley’s congratulations to her brother, on his approaching
 12894	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmarriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote even
 12895	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her
 12896	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tformer professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was
 12897	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taffected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing
 12898	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.
 12899	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12900	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThe joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information,
 12901	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas as sincere as her brother’s in sending it. Four sides of paper were
 12902	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinsufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of
 12903	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbeing loved by her sister.
 12904	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12905	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tBefore any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations
 12906	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the
 12907	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCollinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The reason of this
 12908	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered
 12909	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tso exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew’s letter, that
 12910	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tCharlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till
 12911	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her friend
 12912	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their
 12913	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmeetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she
 12914	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsaw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of
 12915	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther husband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could even
 12916	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlisten to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away
 12917	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all
 12918	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmeeting frequently at St. James’s, with very decent composure. If he did
 12919	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.
 12920	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12921	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMrs. Phillips’s vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater, tax on his
 12922	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tforbearance; and though Mrs. Phillips, as well as her sister, stood in
 12923	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttoo much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley’s good
 12924	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thumour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar.
 12925	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tNor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all
 12926	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlikely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to shield
 12927	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep
 12928	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\thim to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse
 12929	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twithout mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising
 12930	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfrom all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it
 12931	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tadded to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to
 12932	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing
 12933	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at
 12934	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tPemberley.

 12940	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12941	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tHappy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got
 12942	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trid of her two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride
 12943	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may
 12944	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tbe guessed. I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the
 12945	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\taccomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many
 12946	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible,
 12947	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tamiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it
 12948	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity
 12949	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and
 12950	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tinvariably silly.
 12951	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12952	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her
 12953	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdrew him oftener from home than anything else could do. He delighted in
 12954	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tgoing to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.

 12956	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near
 12957	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to
 12958	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t_his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart. The darling wish of his
 12959	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county
 12960	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source
 12961	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.
 12962	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12963	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tKitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with
 12964	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally
 12965	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tknown, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a
 12966	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttemper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia’s example,
 12967	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less
 12968	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tignorant, and less insipid. From the further disadvantage of Lydia’s
 12969	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsociety she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham
 12970	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfrequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of
 12971	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tballs and young men, her father would never consent to her going.
 12972	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12973	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily
 12974	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdrawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet’s being quite
 12975	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tunable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but
 12976	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tshe could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no
 12977	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlonger mortified by comparisons between her sisters’ beauty and her own,
 12978	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tit was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without
 12979	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tmuch reluctance.
 12980	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12981	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAs for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from
 12982	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthe marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that
 12983	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude
 12984	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every
 12985	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on
 12986	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received
 12987	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfrom Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least,
 12988	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tif not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to this
 12989	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\teffect:
 12990	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12991	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“MY DEAR LIZZY,
 12992	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 12993	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear
 12994	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you so
 12995	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will think of us.
 12996	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tI am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and I do not
 12997	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthink we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help.
 12998	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAny place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but however,
 12999	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdo not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.
 13000	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 13001	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t“Yours, etc.”
 13002	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 13003	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tAs it happened that Elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured in
 13004	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.
 13005	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tSuch relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice
 13006	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tof what might be called economy in her own private expences, she
 13007	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tfrequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an
 13008	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tincome as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in
 13009	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttheir wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to
 13010	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttheir support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or
 13011	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\therself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance
 13012	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttowards discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the
 13013	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\trestoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the
 13014	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\textreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap
 13015	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsituation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection for
 13016	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther soon sunk into indifference; hers lasted a little longer; and
 13017	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to
 13018	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treputation which her marriage had given her.
 13019	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 13020	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tThough Darcy could never receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for
 13021	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tElizabeth’s sake, he assisted him further in his profession. Lydia was
 13022	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\toccasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself
 13023	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently
 13024	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tstaid so long, that even Bingley’s good humour was overcome, and he
 13025	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tproceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone.
 13026	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 13027	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tMiss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy’s marriage; but as she
 13028	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tthought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she
 13029	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tdropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as
 13030	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tattentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility
 13031	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto Elizabeth.
 13032	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 13033	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tPemberley was now Georgiana’s home; and the attachment of the sisters
 13034	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twas exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each
 13035	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tother even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion
 13036	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with
 13037	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tan astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of
 13038	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ttalking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect
 13039	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\twhich almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open
 13040	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tpleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen
 13041	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tin her way. By Elizabeth’s instructions, she began to comprehend that
 13042	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ta woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not
 13043	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\talways allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.
 13044	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 13045	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tLady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;
 13046	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in
 13047	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him
 13048	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tlanguage so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time
 13049	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tall intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth’s persuasion,
 13050	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\the was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;
 13051	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tand, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her
 13052	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tresentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity
 13053	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tto see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait
 13054	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ton them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had
 13055	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\treceived, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the
 13056	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tvisits of her uncle and aunt from the city.
 13057	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\t
 13058	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tWith the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.
 13059	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tDarcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever
 13060	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\tsensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing
 13061	PrideandPrejudicebyJaneAusten.txt\ther into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.
