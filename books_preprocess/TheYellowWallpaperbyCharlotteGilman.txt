    33	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tBy Charlotte Perkins Gilman
    34	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
    35	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
    36	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
    37	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
    38	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tIt is very seldom that mere ordinary people like John and myself secure
    39	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tancestral halls for the summer.
    40	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
    41	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tA colonial mansion, a hereditary estate, I would say a haunted house,
    42	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tand reach the height of romantic felicity--but that would be asking too
    43	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tmuch of fate!
    44	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
    45	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tStill I will proudly declare that there is something queer about it.
    46	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
    47	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tElse, why should it be let so cheaply? And why have stood so long
    48	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tuntenanted?
    49	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
    50	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tJohn laughs at me, of course, but one expects that in marriage.
    51	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
    52	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tJohn is practical in the extreme. He has no patience with faith, an
    53	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tintense horror of superstition, and he scoffs openly at any talk of
    54	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tthings not to be felt and seen and put down in figures.
    55	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
    56	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tJohn is a physician, and PERHAPS--(I would not say it to a living
    57	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tsoul, of course, but this is dead paper and a great relief to my
    58	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tmind)--PERHAPS that is one reason I do not get well faster.
    59	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
    60	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tYou see he does not believe I am sick!
    61	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
    62	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tAnd what can one do?
    63	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
    64	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tIf a physician of high standing, and one's own husband, assures friends
    65	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tand relatives that there is really nothing the matter with one but
    66	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\ttemporary nervous depression--a slight hysterical tendency--what is one
    67	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tto do?
    68	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
    69	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tMy brother is also a physician, and also of high standing, and he says
    70	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tthe same thing.
    71	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
    72	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tSo I take phosphates or phosphites--whichever it is, and tonics, and
    73	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tjourneys, and air, and exercise, and am absolutely forbidden to "work"
    74	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tuntil I am well again.
    75	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
    76	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tPersonally, I disagree with their ideas.
    77	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
    78	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tPersonally, I believe that congenial work, with excitement and change,
    79	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\twould do me good.
    80	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
    81	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tBut what is one to do?
    82	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
    83	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI did write for a while in spite of them; but it DOES exhaust me a good
    84	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tdeal--having to be so sly about it, or else meet with heavy opposition.
    85	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
    86	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI sometimes fancy that in my condition if I had less opposition and more
    87	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tsociety and stimulus--but John says the very worst thing I can do is to
    88	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tthink about my condition, and I confess it always makes me feel bad.
    89	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
    90	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tSo I will let it alone and talk about the house.
    91	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
    92	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tThe most beautiful place! It is quite alone, standing well back from the
    93	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\troad, quite three miles from the village. It makes me think of English
    94	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tplaces that you read about, for there are hedges and walls and gates
    95	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tthat lock, and lots of separate little houses for the gardeners and
    96	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tpeople.
    97	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
    98	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tThere is a DELICIOUS garden! I never saw such a garden--large and shady,
    99	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tfull of box-bordered paths, and lined with long grape-covered arbors
   100	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\twith seats under them.
   101	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   102	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tThere were greenhouses, too, but they are all broken now.
   103	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   104	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tThere was some legal trouble, I believe, something about the heirs and
   105	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tcoheirs; anyhow, the place has been empty for years.
   106	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   107	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tThat spoils my ghostliness, I am afraid, but I don't care--there is
   108	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tsomething strange about the house--I can feel it.
   109	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   110	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI even said so to John one moonlight evening, but he said what I felt
   111	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\twas a DRAUGHT, and shut the window.
   112	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   113	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI get unreasonably angry with John sometimes. I'm sure I never used to
   114	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tbe so sensitive. I think it is due to this nervous condition.
   115	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   116	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tBut John says if I feel so, I shall neglect proper self-control; so I
   117	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\ttake pains to control myself--before him, at least, and that makes me
   118	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tvery tired.
   119	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   120	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI don't like our room a bit. I wanted one downstairs that opened on the
   121	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tpiazza and had roses all over the window, and such pretty old-fashioned
   122	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tchintz hangings! but John would not hear of it.
   123	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   124	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tHe said there was only one window and not room for two beds, and no near
   125	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\troom for him if he took another.
   126	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   127	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tHe is very careful and loving, and hardly lets me stir without special
   128	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tdirection.
   129	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   130	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI have a schedule prescription for each hour in the day; he takes all
   131	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tcare from me, and so I feel basely ungrateful not to value it more.
   132	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   133	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tHe said we came here solely on my account, that I was to have perfect
   134	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\trest and all the air I could get. "Your exercise depends on your
   135	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tstrength, my dear," said he, "and your food somewhat on your appetite;
   136	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tbut air you can absorb all the time." So we took the nursery at the top
   137	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tof the house.
   138	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   139	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tIt is a big, airy room, the whole floor nearly, with windows that look
   140	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tall ways, and air and sunshine galore. It was nursery first and then
   141	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tplayroom and gymnasium, I should judge; for the windows are barred for
   142	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tlittle children, and there are rings and things in the walls.
   143	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   144	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tThe paint and paper look as if a boys' school had used it. It is
   145	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tstripped off--the paper--in great patches all around the head of my bed,
   146	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tabout as far as I can reach, and in a great place on the other side of
   147	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tthe room low down. I never saw a worse paper in my life.
   148	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   149	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tOne of those sprawling flamboyant patterns committing every artistic
   150	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tsin.
   151	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   152	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tIt is dull enough to confuse the eye in following, pronounced enough
   153	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tto constantly irritate and provoke study, and when you follow the
   154	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tlame uncertain curves for a little distance they suddenly commit
   155	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tsuicide--plunge off at outrageous angles, destroy themselves in unheard
   156	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tof contradictions.
   157	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   158	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tThe color is repellent, almost revolting; a smouldering unclean yellow,
   159	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tstrangely faded by the slow-turning sunlight.
   160	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   161	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tIt is a dull yet lurid orange in some places, a sickly sulphur tint in
   162	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tothers.
   163	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   164	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tNo wonder the children hated it! I should hate it myself if I had to
   165	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tlive in this room long.
   166	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   167	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tThere comes John, and I must put this away,--he hates to have me write a
   168	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tword.
   169	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   170	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   171	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tWe have been here two weeks, and I haven't felt like writing before,
   172	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tsince that first day.
   173	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   174	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI am sitting by the window now, up in this atrocious nursery, and
   175	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tthere is nothing to hinder my writing as much as I please, save lack of
   176	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tstrength.
   177	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   178	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tJohn is away all day, and even some nights when his cases are serious.
   179	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   180	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI am glad my case is not serious!
   181	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   182	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tBut these nervous troubles are dreadfully depressing.
   183	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   184	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tJohn does not know how much I really suffer. He knows there is no REASON
   185	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tto suffer, and that satisfies him.
   186	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   187	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tOf course it is only nervousness. It does weigh on me so not to do my
   188	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tduty in any way!
   189	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   190	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI meant to be such a help to John, such a real rest and comfort, and
   191	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\there I am a comparative burden already!
   192	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   193	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tNobody would believe what an effort it is to do what little I am
   194	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\table,--to dress and entertain, and order things.
   195	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   196	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tIt is fortunate Mary is so good with the baby. Such a dear baby!
   197	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   198	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tAnd yet I CANNOT be with him, it makes me so nervous.
   199	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   200	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI suppose John never was nervous in his life. He laughs at me so about
   201	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tthis wall-paper!
   202	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   203	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tAt first he meant to repaper the room, but afterwards he said that I
   204	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\twas letting it get the better of me, and that nothing was worse for a
   205	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tnervous patient than to give way to such fancies.
   206	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   207	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tHe said that after the wall-paper was changed it would be the heavy
   208	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tbedstead, and then the barred windows, and then that gate at the head of
   209	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tthe stairs, and so on.
   210	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   211	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t"You know the place is doing you good," he said, "and really, dear, I
   212	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tdon't care to renovate the house just for a three months' rental."
   213	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   214	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t"Then do let us go downstairs," I said, "there are such pretty rooms
   215	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tthere."
   216	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   217	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tThen he took me in his arms and called me a blessed little goose,
   218	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tand said he would go down to the cellar, if I wished, and have it
   219	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\twhitewashed into the bargain.
   220	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   221	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tBut he is right enough about the beds and windows and things.
   222	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   223	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tIt is an airy and comfortable room as any one need wish, and, of course,
   224	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI would not be so silly as to make him uncomfortable just for a whim.
   225	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   226	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI'm really getting quite fond of the big room, all but that horrid
   227	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tpaper.
   228	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   229	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tOut of one window I can see the garden, those mysterious deepshaded
   230	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tarbors, the riotous old-fashioned flowers, and bushes and gnarly trees.
   231	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   232	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tOut of another I get a lovely view of the bay and a little private wharf
   233	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tbelonging to the estate. There is a beautiful shaded lane that runs
   234	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tdown there from the house. I always fancy I see people walking in these
   235	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tnumerous paths and arbors, but John has cautioned me not to give way to
   236	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tfancy in the least. He says that with my imaginative power and habit of
   237	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tstory-making, a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to all manner
   238	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tof excited fancies, and that I ought to use my will and good sense to
   239	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tcheck the tendency. So I try.
   240	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   241	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI think sometimes that if I were only well enough to write a little it
   242	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\twould relieve the press of ideas and rest me.
   243	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   244	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tBut I find I get pretty tired when I try.
   245	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   246	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tIt is so discouraging not to have any advice and companionship about
   247	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tmy work. When I get really well, John says we will ask Cousin Henry and
   248	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tJulia down for a long visit; but he says he would as soon put fireworks
   249	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tin my pillow-case as to let me have those stimulating people about now.
   250	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   251	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI wish I could get well faster.
   252	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   253	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tBut I must not think about that. This paper looks to me as if it KNEW
   254	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\twhat a vicious influence it had!
   255	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   256	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tThere is a recurrent spot where the pattern lolls like a broken neck and
   257	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\ttwo bulbous eyes stare at you upside down.
   258	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   259	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI get positively angry with the impertinence of it and the
   260	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\teverlastingness. Up and down and sideways they crawl, and those absurd,
   261	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tunblinking eyes are everywhere. There is one place where two breadths
   262	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tdidn't match, and the eyes go all up and down the line, one a little
   263	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\thigher than the other.
   264	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   265	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI never saw so much expression in an inanimate thing before, and we all
   266	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tknow how much expression they have! I used to lie awake as a child and
   267	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tget more entertainment and terror out of blank walls and plain furniture
   268	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tthan most children could find in a toy store.
   269	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   270	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI remember what a kindly wink the knobs of our big, old bureau used to
   271	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\thave, and there was one chair that always seemed like a strong friend.
   272	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   273	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI used to feel that if any of the other things looked too fierce I could
   274	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\talways hop into that chair and be safe.
   275	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   276	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tThe furniture in this room is no worse than inharmonious, however, for
   277	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\twe had to bring it all from downstairs. I suppose when this was used
   278	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tas a playroom they had to take the nursery things out, and no wonder! I
   279	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tnever saw such ravages as the children have made here.
   280	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   281	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tThe wall-paper, as I said before, is torn off in spots, and it sticketh
   282	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tcloser than a brother--they must have had perseverance as well as
   283	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\thatred.
   284	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   285	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tThen the floor is scratched and gouged and splintered, the plaster
   286	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\titself is dug out here and there, and this great heavy bed which is all
   287	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\twe found in the room, looks as if it had been through the wars.
   288	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   289	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tBut I don't mind it a bit--only the paper.
   290	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   291	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tThere comes John's sister. Such a dear girl as she is, and so careful of
   292	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tme! I must not let her find me writing.
   293	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   294	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tShe is a perfect and enthusiastic housekeeper, and hopes for no better
   295	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tprofession. I verily believe she thinks it is the writing which made me
   296	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tsick!
   297	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   298	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tBut I can write when she is out, and see her a long way off from these
   299	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\twindows.
   300	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   301	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tThere is one that commands the road, a lovely shaded winding road, and
   302	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tone that just looks off over the country. A lovely country, too, full of
   303	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tgreat elms and velvet meadows.
   304	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   305	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tThis wall-paper has a kind of sub-pattern in a different shade, a
   306	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tparticularly irritating one, for you can only see it in certain lights,
   307	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tand not clearly then.
   308	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   309	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tBut in the places where it isn't faded and where the sun is just so--I
   310	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tcan see a strange, provoking, formless sort of figure, that seems to
   311	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tskulk about behind that silly and conspicuous front design.
   312	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   313	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tThere's sister on the stairs!
   314	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   315	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   316	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tWell, the Fourth of July is over! The people are gone and I am tired
   317	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tout. John thought it might do me good to see a little company, so we
   318	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tjust had mother and Nellie and the children down for a week.
   319	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   320	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tOf course I didn't do a thing. Jennie sees to everything now.
   321	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   322	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tBut it tired me all the same.
   323	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   324	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tJohn says if I don't pick up faster he shall send me to Weir Mitchell in
   325	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tthe fall.
   326	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   327	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tBut I don't want to go there at all. I had a friend who was in his hands
   328	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tonce, and she says he is just like John and my brother, only more so!
   329	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   330	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tBesides, it is such an undertaking to go so far.
   331	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   332	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI don't feel as if it was worth while to turn my hand over for anything,
   333	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tand I'm getting dreadfully fretful and querulous.
   334	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   335	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI cry at nothing, and cry most of the time.
   336	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   337	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tOf course I don't when John is here, or anybody else, but when I am
   338	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\talone.
   339	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   340	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tAnd I am alone a good deal just now. John is kept in town very often by
   341	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tserious cases, and Jennie is good and lets me alone when I want her to.
   342	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   343	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tSo I walk a little in the garden or down that lovely lane, sit on the
   344	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tporch under the roses, and lie down up here a good deal.
   345	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   346	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI'm getting really fond of the room in spite of the wall-paper. Perhaps
   347	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tBECAUSE of the wall-paper.
   348	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   349	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tIt dwells in my mind so!
   350	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   351	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI lie here on this great immovable bed--it is nailed down, I
   352	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tbelieve--and follow that pattern about by the hour. It is as good as
   353	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tgymnastics, I assure you. I start, we'll say, at the bottom, down in the
   354	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tcorner over there where it has not been touched, and I determine for the
   355	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tthousandth time that I WILL follow that pointless pattern to some sort
   356	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tof a conclusion.
   357	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   358	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI know a little of the principle of design, and I know this thing was
   359	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tnot arranged on any laws of radiation, or alternation, or repetition, or
   360	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tsymmetry, or anything else that I ever heard of.
   361	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   362	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tIt is repeated, of course, by the breadths, but not otherwise.
   363	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   364	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tLooked at in one way each breadth stands alone, the bloated curves and
   365	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tflourishes--a kind of "debased Romanesque" with delirium tremens--go
   366	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\twaddling up and down in isolated columns of fatuity.
   367	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   368	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tBut, on the other hand, they connect diagonally, and the sprawling
   369	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\toutlines run off in great slanting waves of optic horror, like a lot of
   370	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\twallowing seaweeds in full chase.
   371	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   372	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tThe whole thing goes horizontally, too, at least it seems so, and I
   373	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\texhaust myself in trying to distinguish the order of its going in that
   374	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tdirection.
   375	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   376	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tThey have used a horizontal breadth for a frieze, and that adds
   377	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\twonderfully to the confusion.
   378	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   379	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tThere is one end of the room where it is almost intact, and there, when
   380	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tthe crosslights fade and the low sun shines directly upon it, I can
   381	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\talmost fancy radiation after all,--the interminable grotesques seem to
   382	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tform around a common centre and rush off in headlong plunges of equal
   383	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tdistraction.
   384	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   385	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tIt makes me tired to follow it. I will take a nap I guess.
   386	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   387	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI don't know why I should write this.
   388	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   389	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI don't want to.
   390	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   391	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI don't feel able.
   392	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   393	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tAnd I know John would think it absurd. But I MUST say what I feel and
   394	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tthink in some way--it is such a relief!
   395	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   396	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tBut the effort is getting to be greater than the relief.
   397	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   398	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tHalf the time now I am awfully lazy, and lie down ever so much.
   399	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   400	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tJohn says I musn't lose my strength, and has me take cod liver oil and
   401	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tlots of tonics and things, to say nothing of ale and wine and rare meat.
   402	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   403	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tDear John! He loves me very dearly, and hates to have me sick. I tried
   404	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tto have a real earnest reasonable talk with him the other day, and tell
   405	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\thim how I wish he would let me go and make a visit to Cousin Henry and
   406	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tJulia.
   407	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   408	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tBut he said I wasn't able to go, nor able to stand it after I got there;
   409	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tand I did not make out a very good case for myself, for I was crying
   410	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tbefore I had finished.
   411	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   412	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tIt is getting to be a great effort for me to think straight. Just this
   413	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tnervous weakness I suppose.
   414	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   415	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tAnd dear John gathered me up in his arms, and just carried me upstairs
   416	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tand laid me on the bed, and sat by me and read to me till it tired my
   417	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\thead.
   418	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   419	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tHe said I was his darling and his comfort and all he had, and that I
   420	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tmust take care of myself for his sake, and keep well.
   421	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   422	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tHe says no one but myself can help me out of it, that I must use my will
   423	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tand self-control and not let any silly fancies run away with me.
   424	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   425	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tThere's one comfort, the baby is well and happy, and does not have to
   426	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\toccupy this nursery with the horrid wall-paper.
   427	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   428	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tIf we had not used it, that blessed child would have! What a fortunate
   429	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tescape! Why, I wouldn't have a child of mine, an impressionable little
   430	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tthing, live in such a room for worlds.
   431	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   432	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI never thought of it before, but it is lucky that John kept me here
   433	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tafter all, I can stand it so much easier than a baby, you see.
   434	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   435	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tOf course I never mention it to them any more--I am too wise,--but I
   436	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tkeep watch of it all the same.
   437	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   438	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tThere are things in that paper that nobody knows but me, or ever will.
   439	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   440	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tBehind that outside pattern the dim shapes get clearer every day.
   441	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   442	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tIt is always the same shape, only very numerous.
   443	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   444	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tAnd it is like a woman stooping down and creeping about behind that
   445	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tpattern. I don't like it a bit. I wonder--I begin to think--I wish John
   446	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\twould take me away from here!
   447	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   448	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tIt is so hard to talk with John about my case, because he is so wise,
   449	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tand because he loves me so.
   450	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   451	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tBut I tried it last night.
   452	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   453	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tIt was moonlight. The moon shines in all around just as the sun does.
   454	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   455	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI hate to see it sometimes, it creeps so slowly, and always comes in by
   456	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tone window or another.
   457	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   458	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tJohn was asleep and I hated to waken him, so I kept still and watched
   459	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tthe moonlight on that undulating wall-paper till I felt creepy.
   460	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   461	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tThe faint figure behind seemed to shake the pattern, just as if she
   462	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\twanted to get out.
   463	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   464	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI got up softly and went to feel and see if the paper DID move, and when
   465	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI came back John was awake.
   466	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   467	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t"What is it, little girl?" he said. "Don't go walking about like
   468	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tthat--you'll get cold."
   469	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   470	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI though it was a good time to talk, so I told him that I really was not
   471	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tgaining here, and that I wished he would take me away.
   472	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   473	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t"Why darling!" said he, "our lease will be up in three weeks, and I
   474	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tcan't see how to leave before.
   475	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   476	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t"The repairs are not done at home, and I cannot possibly leave town just
   477	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tnow. Of course if you were in any danger, I could and would, but you
   478	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\treally are better, dear, whether you can see it or not. I am a doctor,
   479	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tdear, and I know. You are gaining flesh and color, your appetite is
   480	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tbetter, I feel really much easier about you."
   481	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   482	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t"I don't weigh a bit more," said I, "nor as much; and my appetite may be
   483	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tbetter in the evening when you are here, but it is worse in the morning
   484	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\twhen you are away!"
   485	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   486	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t"Bless her little heart!" said he with a big hug, "she shall be as sick
   487	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tas she pleases! But now let's improve the shining hours by going to
   488	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tsleep, and talk about it in the morning!"
   489	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   490	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t"And you won't go away?" I asked gloomily.
   491	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   492	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t"Why, how can I, dear? It is only three weeks more and then we will
   493	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\ttake a nice little trip of a few days while Jennie is getting the house
   494	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tready. Really dear you are better!"
   495	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   496	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t"Better in body perhaps--" I began, and stopped short, for he sat up
   497	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tstraight and looked at me with such a stern, reproachful look that I
   498	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tcould not say another word.
   499	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   500	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t"My darling," said he, "I beg of you, for my sake and for our child's
   501	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tsake, as well as for your own, that you will never for one instant
   502	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tlet that idea enter your mind! There is nothing so dangerous, so
   503	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tfascinating, to a temperament like yours. It is a false and foolish
   504	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tfancy. Can you not trust me as a physician when I tell you so?"
   505	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   506	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tSo of course I said no more on that score, and we went to sleep before
   507	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tlong. He thought I was asleep first, but I wasn't, and lay there for
   508	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\thours trying to decide whether that front pattern and the back pattern
   509	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\treally did move together or separately.
   510	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   511	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   512	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tOn a pattern like this, by daylight, there is a lack of sequence, a
   513	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tdefiance of law, that is a constant irritant to a normal mind.
   514	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   515	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tThe color is hideous enough, and unreliable enough, and infuriating
   516	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tenough, but the pattern is torturing.
   517	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   518	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tYou think you have mastered it, but just as you get well underway in
   519	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tfollowing, it turns a back-somersault and there you are. It slaps you
   520	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tin the face, knocks you down, and tramples upon you. It is like a bad
   521	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tdream.
   522	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   523	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tThe outside pattern is a florid arabesque, reminding one of a fungus.
   524	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tIf you can imagine a toadstool in joints, an interminable string of
   525	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\ttoadstools, budding and sprouting in endless convolutions--why, that is
   526	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tsomething like it.
   527	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   528	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tThat is, sometimes!
   529	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   530	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tThere is one marked peculiarity about this paper, a thing nobody seems
   531	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tto notice but myself, and that is that it changes as the light changes.
   532	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   533	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tWhen the sun shoots in through the east window--I always watch for that
   534	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tfirst long, straight ray--it changes so quickly that I never can quite
   535	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tbelieve it.
   536	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   537	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tThat is why I watch it always.
   538	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   539	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tBy moonlight--the moon shines in all night when there is a moon--I
   540	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\twouldn't know it was the same paper.
   541	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   542	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tAt night in any kind of light, in twilight, candle light, lamplight, and
   543	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tworst of all by moonlight, it becomes bars! The outside pattern I mean,
   544	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tand the woman behind it is as plain as can be.
   545	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   546	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI didn't realize for a long time what the thing was that showed behind,
   547	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tthat dim sub-pattern, but now I am quite sure it is a woman.
   548	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   549	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tBy daylight she is subdued, quiet. I fancy it is the pattern that keeps
   550	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\ther so still. It is so puzzling. It keeps me quiet by the hour.
   551	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   552	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI lie down ever so much now. John says it is good for me, and to sleep
   553	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tall I can.
   554	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   555	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tIndeed he started the habit by making me lie down for an hour after each
   556	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tmeal.
   557	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   558	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tIt is a very bad habit I am convinced, for you see I don't sleep.
   559	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   560	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tAnd that cultivates deceit, for I don't tell them I'm awake--O no!
   561	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   562	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tThe fact is I am getting a little afraid of John.
   563	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   564	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tHe seems very queer sometimes, and even Jennie has an inexplicable look.
   565	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   566	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tIt strikes me occasionally, just as a scientific hypothesis,--that
   567	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tperhaps it is the paper!
   568	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   569	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI have watched John when he did not know I was looking, and come into
   570	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tthe room suddenly on the most innocent excuses, and I've caught him
   571	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tseveral times LOOKING AT THE PAPER! And Jennie too. I caught Jennie with
   572	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\ther hand on it once.
   573	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   574	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tShe didn't know I was in the room, and when I asked her in a quiet, a
   575	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tvery quiet voice, with the most restrained manner possible, what she
   576	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\twas doing with the paper--she turned around as if she had been caught
   577	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tstealing, and looked quite angry--asked me why I should frighten her so!
   578	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   579	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tThen she said that the paper stained everything it touched, that she had
   580	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tfound yellow smooches on all my clothes and John's, and she wished we
   581	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\twould be more careful!
   582	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   583	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tDid not that sound innocent? But I know she was studying that pattern,
   584	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tand I am determined that nobody shall find it out but myself!
   585	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   586	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   587	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tLife is very much more exciting now than it used to be. You see I have
   588	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tsomething more to expect, to look forward to, to watch. I really do eat
   589	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tbetter, and am more quiet than I was.
   590	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   591	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tJohn is so pleased to see me improve! He laughed a little the other day,
   592	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tand said I seemed to be flourishing in spite of my wall-paper.
   593	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   594	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI turned it off with a laugh. I had no intention of telling him it was
   595	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tBECAUSE of the wall-paper--he would make fun of me. He might even want
   596	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tto take me away.
   597	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   598	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI don't want to leave now until I have found it out. There is a week
   599	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tmore, and I think that will be enough.
   600	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   601	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   602	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI'm feeling ever so much better! I don't sleep much at night, for it
   603	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tis so interesting to watch developments; but I sleep a good deal in the
   604	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tdaytime.
   605	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   606	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tIn the daytime it is tiresome and perplexing.
   607	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   608	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tThere are always new shoots on the fungus, and new shades of yellow
   609	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tall over it. I cannot keep count of them, though I have tried
   610	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tconscientiously.
   611	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   612	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tIt is the strangest yellow, that wall-paper! It makes me think of all
   613	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tthe yellow things I ever saw--not beautiful ones like buttercups, but
   614	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\told foul, bad yellow things.
   615	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   616	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tBut there is something else about that paper--the smell! I noticed it
   617	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tthe moment we came into the room, but with so much air and sun it was
   618	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tnot bad. Now we have had a week of fog and rain, and whether the windows
   619	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tare open or not, the smell is here.
   620	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   621	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tIt creeps all over the house.
   622	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   623	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI find it hovering in the dining-room, skulking in the parlor, hiding in
   624	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tthe hall, lying in wait for me on the stairs.
   625	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   626	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tIt gets into my hair.
   627	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   628	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tEven when I go to ride, if I turn my head suddenly and surprise
   629	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tit--there is that smell!
   630	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   631	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tSuch a peculiar odor, too! I have spent hours in trying to analyze it,
   632	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tto find what it smelled like.
   633	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   634	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tIt is not bad--at first, and very gentle, but quite the subtlest, most
   635	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tenduring odor I ever met.
   636	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   637	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tIn this damp weather it is awful, I wake up in the night and find it
   638	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\thanging over me.
   639	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   640	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tIt used to disturb me at first. I thought seriously of burning the
   641	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\thouse--to reach the smell.
   642	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   643	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tBut now I am used to it. The only thing I can think of that it is like
   644	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tis the COLOR of the paper! A yellow smell.
   645	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   646	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tThere is a very funny mark on this wall, low down, near the mopboard.
   647	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tA streak that runs round the room. It goes behind every piece of
   648	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tfurniture, except the bed, a long, straight, even SMOOCH, as if it had
   649	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tbeen rubbed over and over.
   650	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   651	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI wonder how it was done and who did it, and what they did it for. Round
   652	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tand round and round--round and round and round--it makes me dizzy!
   653	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   654	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   655	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI really have discovered something at last.
   656	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   657	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tThrough watching so much at night, when it changes so, I have finally
   658	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tfound out.
   659	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   660	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tThe front pattern DOES move--and no wonder! The woman behind shakes it!
   661	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   662	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tSometimes I think there are a great many women behind, and sometimes
   663	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tonly one, and she crawls around fast, and her crawling shakes it all
   664	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tover.
   665	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   666	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tThen in the very bright spots she keeps still, and in the very shady
   667	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tspots she just takes hold of the bars and shakes them hard.
   668	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   669	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tAnd she is all the time trying to climb through. But nobody could climb
   670	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tthrough that pattern--it strangles so; I think that is why it has so
   671	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tmany heads.
   672	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   673	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tThey get through, and then the pattern strangles them off and turns them
   674	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tupside down, and makes their eyes white!
   675	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   676	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tIf those heads were covered or taken off it would not be half so bad.
   677	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   678	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   679	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI think that woman gets out in the daytime!
   680	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   681	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tAnd I'll tell you why--privately--I've seen her!
   682	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   683	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI can see her out of every one of my windows!
   684	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   685	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tIt is the same woman, I know, for she is always creeping, and most women
   686	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tdo not creep by daylight.
   687	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   688	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI see her on that long road under the trees, creeping along, and when a
   689	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tcarriage comes she hides under the blackberry vines.
   690	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   691	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI don't blame her a bit. It must be very humiliating to be caught
   692	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tcreeping by daylight!
   693	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   694	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI always lock the door when I creep by daylight. I can't do it at night,
   695	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tfor I know John would suspect something at once.
   696	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   697	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tAnd John is so queer now, that I don't want to irritate him. I wish he
   698	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\twould take another room! Besides, I don't want anybody to get that woman
   699	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tout at night but myself.
   700	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   701	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI often wonder if I could see her out of all the windows at once.
   702	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   703	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tBut, turn as fast as I can, I can only see out of one at one time.
   704	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   705	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tAnd though I always see her, she MAY be able to creep faster than I can
   706	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tturn!
   707	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   708	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI have watched her sometimes away off in the open country, creeping as
   709	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tfast as a cloud shadow in a high wind.
   710	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   711	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tIf only that top pattern could be gotten off from the under one! I mean
   712	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tto try it, little by little.
   713	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   714	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI have found out another funny thing, but I shan't tell it this time! It
   715	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tdoes not do to trust people too much.
   716	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   717	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tThere are only two more days to get this paper off, and I believe John
   718	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tis beginning to notice. I don't like the look in his eyes.
   719	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   720	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tAnd I heard him ask Jennie a lot of professional questions about me. She
   721	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\thad a very good report to give.
   722	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   723	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tShe said I slept a good deal in the daytime.
   724	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   725	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tJohn knows I don't sleep very well at night, for all I'm so quiet!
   726	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   727	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tHe asked me all sorts of questions, too, and pretended to be very loving
   728	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tand kind.
   729	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   730	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tAs if I couldn't see through him!
   731	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   732	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tStill, I don't wonder he acts so, sleeping under this paper for three
   733	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tmonths.
   734	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   735	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tIt only interests me, but I feel sure John and Jennie are secretly
   736	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\taffected by it.
   737	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   738	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   739	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tHurrah! This is the last day, but it is enough. John is to stay in town
   740	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tover night, and won't be out until this evening.
   741	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   742	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tJennie wanted to sleep with me--the sly thing! but I told her I should
   743	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tundoubtedly rest better for a night all alone.
   744	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   745	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tThat was clever, for really I wasn't alone a bit! As soon as it was
   746	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tmoonlight and that poor thing began to crawl and shake the pattern, I
   747	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tgot up and ran to help her.
   748	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   749	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI pulled and she shook, I shook and she pulled, and before morning we
   750	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\thad peeled off yards of that paper.
   751	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   752	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tA strip about as high as my head and half around the room.
   753	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   754	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tAnd then when the sun came and that awful pattern began to laugh at me,
   755	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI declared I would finish it to-day!
   756	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   757	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tWe go away to-morrow, and they are moving all my furniture down again to
   758	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tleave things as they were before.
   759	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   760	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tJennie looked at the wall in amazement, but I told her merrily that I
   761	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tdid it out of pure spite at the vicious thing.
   762	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   763	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tShe laughed and said she wouldn't mind doing it herself, but I must not
   764	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tget tired.
   765	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   766	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tHow she betrayed herself that time!
   767	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   768	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tBut I am here, and no person touches this paper but me--not ALIVE!
   769	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   770	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tShe tried to get me out of the room--it was too patent! But I said it
   771	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\twas so quiet and empty and clean now that I believed I would lie down
   772	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tagain and sleep all I could; and not to wake me even for dinner--I would
   773	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tcall when I woke.
   774	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   775	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tSo now she is gone, and the servants are gone, and the things are gone,
   776	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tand there is nothing left but that great bedstead nailed down, with the
   777	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tcanvas mattress we found on it.
   778	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   779	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tWe shall sleep downstairs to-night, and take the boat home to-morrow.
   780	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   781	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI quite enjoy the room, now it is bare again.
   782	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   783	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tHow those children did tear about here!
   784	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   785	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tThis bedstead is fairly gnawed!
   786	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   787	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tBut I must get to work.
   788	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   789	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI have locked the door and thrown the key down into the front path.
   790	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   791	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI don't want to go out, and I don't want to have anybody come in, till
   792	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tJohn comes.
   793	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   794	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI want to astonish him.
   795	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   796	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI've got a rope up here that even Jennie did not find. If that woman
   797	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tdoes get out, and tries to get away, I can tie her!
   798	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   799	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tBut I forgot I could not reach far without anything to stand on!
   800	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   801	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tThis bed will NOT move!
   802	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   803	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI tried to lift and push it until I was lame, and then I got so angry I
   804	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tbit off a little piece at one corner--but it hurt my teeth.
   805	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   806	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tThen I peeled off all the paper I could reach standing on the floor.
   807	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tIt sticks horribly and the pattern just enjoys it! All those strangled
   808	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\theads and bulbous eyes and waddling fungus growths just shriek with
   809	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tderision!
   810	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   811	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI am getting angry enough to do something desperate. To jump out of the
   812	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\twindow would be admirable exercise, but the bars are too strong even to
   813	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\ttry.
   814	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   815	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tBesides I wouldn't do it. Of course not. I know well enough that a step
   816	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tlike that is improper and might be misconstrued.
   817	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   818	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI don't like to LOOK out of the windows even--there are so many of those
   819	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tcreeping women, and they creep so fast.
   820	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   821	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI wonder if they all come out of that wall-paper as I did?
   822	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   823	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tBut I am securely fastened now by my well-hidden rope--you don't get ME
   824	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tout in the road there!
   825	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   826	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI suppose I shall have to get back behind the pattern when it comes
   827	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tnight, and that is hard!
   828	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   829	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tIt is so pleasant to be out in this great room and creep around as I
   830	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tplease!
   831	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   832	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI don't want to go outside. I won't, even if Jennie asks me to.
   833	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   834	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tFor outside you have to creep on the ground, and everything is green
   835	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tinstead of yellow.
   836	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   837	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tBut here I can creep smoothly on the floor, and my shoulder just fits in
   838	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tthat long smooch around the wall, so I cannot lose my way.
   839	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   840	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tWhy there's John at the door!
   841	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   842	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tIt is no use, young man, you can't open it!
   843	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   844	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tHow he does call and pound!
   845	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   846	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tNow he's crying for an axe.
   847	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   848	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tIt would be a shame to break down that beautiful door!
   849	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   850	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t"John dear!" said I in the gentlest voice, "the key is down by the front
   851	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tsteps, under a plantain leaf!"
   852	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   853	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tThat silenced him for a few moments.
   854	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   855	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tThen he said--very quietly indeed, "Open the door, my darling!"
   856	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   857	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t"I can't," said I. "The key is down by the front door under a plantain
   858	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tleaf!"
   859	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   860	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tAnd then I said it again, several times, very gently and slowly, and
   861	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tsaid it so often that he had to go and see, and he got it of course, and
   862	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tcame in. He stopped short by the door.
   863	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   864	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t"What is the matter?" he cried. "For God's sake, what are you doing!"
   865	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   866	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tI kept on creeping just the same, but I looked at him over my shoulder.
   867	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   868	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t"I've got out at last," said I, "in spite of you and Jane. And I've
   869	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tpulled off most of the paper, so you can't put me back!"
   870	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\t
   871	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tNow why should that man have fainted? But he did, and right across my
   872	TheYellowWallpaperbyCharlotteGilman.txt\tpath by the wall, so that I had to creep over him every time!
