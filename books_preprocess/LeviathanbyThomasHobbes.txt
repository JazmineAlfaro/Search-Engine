    51	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTRANSCRIBER'S NOTES ON THE E-TEXT:
    52	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
    53	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThis E-text was prepared from the Pelican Classics edition of Leviathan,
    54	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich in turn was prepared from the first edition. I have tried to
    55	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfollow as closely as possible the original, and to give the flavour of
    56	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe text that Hobbes himself proof-read, but the following differences
    57	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere unavoidable.
    58	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
    59	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHobbes used capitals and italics very extensively, for emphasis, for
    60	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tproper names, for quotations, and sometimes, it seems, just because.
    61	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
    62	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe original has very extensive margin notes, which are used to show
    63	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhere he introduces the definitions of words and concepts, to give in
    64	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshort the subject that a paragraph or section is dealing with, and to
    65	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgive references to his quotations, largely but not exclusively biblical.
    66	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo some degree, these margin notes seem to have been intended to serve
    67	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin place of an index, the original having none. They are all in italics.
    68	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
    69	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHe also used italics for words in other languages than English, and
    70	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere are a number of Greek words, in the Greek alphabet, in the text.
    71	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
    72	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo deal with these within the limits of plain vanilla ASCII, I have done
    73	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe following in this E-text.
    74	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
    75	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tI have restricted my use of full capitalization to those places where
    76	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHobbes used it, except in the chapter headings, which I have fully
    77	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcapitalized, where Hobbes used a mixture of full capitalization and
    78	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\titalics.
    79	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
    80	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhere it is clear that the italics are to indicate the text is quoting,
    81	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tI have introduced quotation marks. Within quotation marks I have
    82	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tretained the capitalization that Hobbes used.
    83	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
    84	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhere italics seem to be used for emphasis, or for proper names, or just
    85	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbecause, I have capitalized the initial letter of the words. This has
    86	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe disadvantage that they are not then distinguished from those that
    87	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHobbes capitalized in plain text, but the extent of his italics would
    88	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmake the text very ugly if I was to use an underscore or slash.
    89	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
    90	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhere the margin notes are either to introduce the paragraph subject,
    91	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor to show where he introduces word definitions, I have included them as
    92	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\theaders to the paragraph, again with all words having initial capitals,
    93	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand on a shortened line.
    94	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
    95	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor margin references to quotes, I have included them in the text,
    96	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin brackets immediately next to the quotation. Where Hobbes included
    97	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treferences in the main text, I have left them as he put them, except to
    98	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tchange his square brackets to round.
    99	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   100	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor the Greek alphabet, I have simply substituted the nearest ordinary
   101	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tletters that I can, and I have used initial capitals for foreign
   102	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlanguage words.
   103	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   104	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNeither Thomas Hobbes nor his typesetters seem to have had many
   105	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinhibitions about spelling and punctuation. I have tried to reproduce
   106	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tboth exactly, with the exception of the introduction of quotation marks.
   107	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   108	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn preparing the text, I have found that it has much more meaning if
   109	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tI read it with sub-vocalization, or aloud, rather than trying to read
   110	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsilently. Hobbes' use of emphasis and his eccentric punctuation and
   111	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconstruction seem then to work.
   112	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   113	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   114	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   115	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTO MY MOST HONOR'D FRIEND Mr. FRANCIS GODOLPHIN of GODOLPHIN
   116	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   117	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   118	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHONOR'D SIR.
   119	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   120	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tYour most worthy Brother Mr SIDNEY GODOLPHIN, when he lived, was pleas'd
   121	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto think my studies something, and otherwise to oblige me, as you know,
   122	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith reall testimonies of his good opinion, great in themselves, and the
   123	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgreater for the worthinesse of his person. For there is not any vertue
   124	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat disposeth a man, either to the service of God, or to the service
   125	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof his Country, to Civill Society, or private Friendship, that did not
   126	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmanifestly appear in his conversation, not as acquired by necessity,
   127	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor affected upon occasion, but inhaerent, and shining in a generous
   128	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconstitution of his nature. Therefore in honour and gratitude to him,
   129	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand with devotion to your selfe, I humbly Dedicate unto you this my
   130	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdiscourse of Common-wealth. I know not how the world will receive it,
   131	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnor how it may reflect on those that shall seem to favour it. For in a
   132	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tway beset with those that contend on one side for too great Liberty, and
   133	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ton the other side for too much Authority, 'tis hard to passe between the
   134	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpoints of both unwounded. But yet, me thinks, the endeavour to advance
   135	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Civill Power, should not be by the Civill Power condemned; nor
   136	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprivate men, by reprehending it, declare they think that Power too
   137	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgreat. Besides, I speak not of the men, but (in the Abstract) of the
   138	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSeat of Power, (like to those simple and unpartiall creatures in the
   139	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRoman Capitol, that with their noyse defended those within it, not
   140	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbecause they were they, but there) offending none, I think, but those
   141	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twithout, or such within (if there be any such) as favour them. That
   142	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich perhaps may most offend, are certain Texts of Holy Scripture,
   143	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talledged by me to other purpose than ordinarily they use to be by
   144	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tothers. But I have done it with due submission, and also (in order to
   145	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmy Subject) necessarily; for they are the Outworks of the Enemy, from
   146	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhence they impugne the Civill Power. If notwithstanding this, you find
   147	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmy labour generally decryed, you may be pleased to excuse your selfe,
   148	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand say that I am a man that love my own opinions, and think all true I
   149	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsay, that I honoured your Brother, and honour you, and have presum'd on
   150	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat, to assume the Title (without your knowledge) of being, as I am,
   151	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   152	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSir,

   306	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTHE INTRODUCTION
   307	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   308	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   309	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNature (the art whereby God hath made and governes the world) is by the
   310	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tart of man, as in many other things, so in this also imitated, that it
   311	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcan make an Artificial Animal. For seeing life is but a motion of Limbs,
   312	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe begining whereof is in some principall part within; why may we not
   313	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsay, that all Automata (Engines that move themselves by springs and
   314	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twheeles as doth a watch) have an artificiall life? For what is the
   315	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHeart, but a Spring; and the Nerves, but so many Strings; and the
   316	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJoynts, but so many Wheeles, giving motion to the whole Body, such as
   317	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas intended by the Artificer? Art goes yet further, imitating that
   318	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRationall and most excellent worke of Nature, Man. For by Art is created
   319	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat great LEVIATHAN called a COMMON-WEALTH, or STATE, (in latine
   320	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCIVITAS) which is but an Artificiall Man; though of greater stature
   321	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand strength than the Naturall, for whose protection and defence it
   322	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas intended; and in which, the Soveraignty is an Artificiall Soul, as
   323	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgiving life and motion to the whole body; The Magistrates, and other
   324	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOfficers of Judicature and Execution, artificiall Joynts; Reward and
   325	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPunishment (by which fastned to the seat of the Soveraignty, every joynt
   326	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand member is moved to performe his duty) are the Nerves, that do the
   327	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsame in the Body Naturall; The Wealth and Riches of all the particular
   328	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmembers, are the Strength; Salus Populi (the Peoples Safety) its
   329	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBusinesse; Counsellors, by whom all things needfull for it to know,
   330	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare suggested unto it, are the Memory; Equity and Lawes, an artificiall
   331	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tReason and Will; Concord, Health; Sedition, Sicknesse; and Civill War,
   332	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDeath. Lastly, the Pacts and Covenants, by which the parts of this Body
   333	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPolitique were at first made, set together, and united, resemble that
   334	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFiat, or the Let Us Make Man, pronounced by God in the Creation.
   335	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   336	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo describe the Nature of this Artificiall man, I will consider
   337	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   338	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFirst the Matter thereof, and the Artificer; both which is Man.
   339	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   340	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSecondly, How, and by what Covenants it is made; what are the Rights and
   341	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tjust Power or Authority of a Soveraigne; and what it is that Preserveth
   342	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Dissolveth it.
   343	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   344	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThirdly, what is a Christian Common-Wealth.
   345	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   346	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLastly, what is the Kingdome of Darkness.
   347	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   348	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConcerning the first, there is a saying much usurped of late, That
   349	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWisedome is acquired, not by reading of Books, but of Men. Consequently
   350	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhereunto, those persons, that for the most part can give no other proof
   351	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof being wise, take great delight to shew what they think they have read
   352	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin men, by uncharitable censures of one another behind their backs.
   353	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut there is another saying not of late understood, by which they might
   354	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlearn truly to read one another, if they would take the pains; and that
   355	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis, Nosce Teipsum, Read Thy Self: which was not meant, as it is now
   356	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tused, to countenance, either the barbarous state of men in power,
   357	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttowards their inferiors; or to encourage men of low degree, to a
   358	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsawcie behaviour towards their betters; But to teach us, that for the
   359	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsimilitude of the thoughts, and Passions of one man, to the thoughts,
   360	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Passions of another, whosoever looketh into himselfe, and
   361	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsidereth what he doth, when he does Think, Opine, Reason, Hope,
   362	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFeare, &c, and upon what grounds; he shall thereby read and know,
   363	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhat are the thoughts, and Passions of all other men, upon the like
   364	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\toccasions. I say the similitude of Passions, which are the same in all
   365	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen, Desire, Feare, Hope, &c; not the similitude or The Objects of the
   366	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPassions, which are the things Desired, Feared, Hoped, &c: for these the
   367	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconstitution individuall, and particular education do so vary, and they
   368	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare so easie to be kept from our knowledge, that the characters of mans
   369	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\theart, blotted and confounded as they are, with dissembling, lying,
   370	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcounterfeiting, and erroneous doctrines, are legible onely to him that
   371	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsearcheth hearts. And though by mens actions wee do discover their
   372	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdesignee sometimes; yet to do it without comparing them with our own,
   373	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand distinguishing all circumstances, by which the case may come to
   374	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe altered, is to decypher without a key, and be for the most part
   375	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdeceived, by too much trust, or by too much diffidence; as he that
   376	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treads, is himselfe a good or evill man.
   377	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   378	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut let one man read another by his actions never so perfectly, it
   379	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tserves him onely with his acquaintance, which are but few. He that is
   380	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto govern a whole Nation, must read in himselfe, not this, or that
   381	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tparticular man; but Man-kind; which though it be hard to do, harder than
   382	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto learn any Language, or Science; yet, when I shall have set down my
   383	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\town reading orderly, and perspicuously, the pains left another, will be
   384	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tonely to consider, if he also find not the same in himselfe. For this
   385	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tkind of Doctrine, admitteth no other Demonstration.

   395	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCHAPTER I. OF SENSE
   396	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   397	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   398	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConcerning the Thoughts of man, I will consider them first Singly, and
   399	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tafterwards in Trayne, or dependance upon one another. Singly, they
   400	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare every one a Representation or Apparence, of some quality, or other
   401	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAccident of a body without us; which is commonly called an Object. Which
   402	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tObject worketh on the Eyes, Eares, and other parts of mans body; and by
   403	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdiversity of working, produceth diversity of Apparences.
   404	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   405	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Originall of them all, is that which we call Sense; (For there is
   406	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tno conception in a mans mind, which hath not at first, totally, or by
   407	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tparts, been begotten upon the organs of Sense.) The rest are derived
   408	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom that originall.
   409	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   410	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo know the naturall cause of Sense, is not very necessary to the
   411	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbusiness now in hand; and I have els-where written of the same at large.
   412	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNevertheless, to fill each part of my present method, I will briefly
   413	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdeliver the same in this place.
   414	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   415	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe cause of Sense, is the Externall Body, or Object, which presseth the
   416	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\torgan proper to each Sense, either immediatly, as in the Tast and Touch;
   417	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor mediately, as in Seeing, Hearing, and Smelling: which pressure, by
   418	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe mediation of Nerves, and other strings, and membranes of the body,
   419	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontinued inwards to the Brain, and Heart, causeth there a resistance,
   420	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor counter-pressure, or endeavour of the heart, to deliver it self:
   421	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich endeavour because Outward, seemeth to be some matter without. And
   422	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis Seeming, or Fancy, is that which men call sense; and consisteth, as
   423	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto the Eye, in a Light, or Colour Figured; To the Eare, in a Sound; To
   424	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Nostrill, in an Odour; To the Tongue and Palat, in a Savour; and
   425	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto the rest of the body, in Heat, Cold, Hardnesse, Softnesse, and such
   426	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother qualities, as we discern by Feeling. All which qualities called
   427	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSensible, are in the object that causeth them, but so many several
   428	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmotions of the matter, by which it presseth our organs diversly. Neither
   429	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin us that are pressed, are they anything els, but divers motions; (for
   430	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmotion, produceth nothing but motion.) But their apparence to us is
   431	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFancy, the same waking, that dreaming. And as pressing, rubbing,
   432	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor striking the Eye, makes us fancy a light; and pressing the Eare,
   433	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tproduceth a dinne; so do the bodies also we see, or hear, produce the
   434	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsame by their strong, though unobserved action, For if those Colours,
   435	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Sounds, were in the Bodies, or Objects that cause them, they could
   436	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot bee severed from them, as by glasses, and in Ecchoes by reflection,
   437	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twee see they are; where we know the thing we see, is in one place; the
   438	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tapparence, in another. And though at some certain distance, the reall,
   439	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand very object seem invested with the fancy it begets in us; Yet still
   440	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe object is one thing, the image or fancy is another. So that Sense in
   441	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall cases, is nothing els but originall fancy, caused (as I have said)
   442	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby the pressure, that is, by the motion, of externall things upon our
   443	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEyes, Eares, and other organs thereunto ordained.
   444	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   445	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut the Philosophy-schooles, through all the Universities of
   446	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChristendome, grounded upon certain Texts of Aristotle, teach another
   447	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdoctrine; and say, For the cause of Vision, that the thing seen, sendeth
   448	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tforth on every side a Visible Species(in English) a Visible Shew,
   449	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tApparition, or Aspect, or a Being Seen; the receiving whereof into the
   450	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEye, is Seeing. And for the cause of Hearing, that the thing heard,
   451	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsendeth forth an Audible Species, that is, an Audible Aspect, or Audible
   452	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBeing Seen; which entring at the Eare, maketh Hearing. Nay for the
   453	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcause of Understanding also, they say the thing Understood sendeth forth
   454	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIntelligible Species, that is, an Intelligible Being Seen; which
   455	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcomming into the Understanding, makes us Understand. I say not this,
   456	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas disapproving the use of Universities: but because I am to speak
   457	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thereafter of their office in a Common-wealth, I must let you see on
   458	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall occasions by the way, what things would be amended in them; amongst
   459	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich the frequency of insignificant Speech is one.
   460	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   461	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   462	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   463	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCHAPTER II. OF IMAGINATION
   464	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   465	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   466	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThat when a thing lies still, unlesse somewhat els stirre it, it will
   467	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlye still for ever, is a truth that no man doubts of. But that when a
   468	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthing is in motion, it will eternally be in motion, unless somewhat els
   469	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tstay it, though the reason be the same, (namely, that nothing can change
   470	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit selfe,) is not so easily assented to. For men measure, not onely
   471	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother men, but all other things, by themselves: and because they find
   472	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthemselves subject after motion to pain, and lassitude, think every
   473	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthing els growes weary of motion, and seeks repose of its own accord;
   474	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlittle considering, whether it be not some other motion, wherein that
   475	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdesire of rest they find in themselves, consisteth. From hence it is,
   476	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat the Schooles say, Heavy bodies fall downwards, out of an appetite
   477	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto rest, and to conserve their nature in that place which is most proper
   478	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor them; ascribing appetite, and Knowledge of what is good for their
   479	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconservation, (which is more than man has) to things inanimate absurdly.
   480	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   481	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhen a Body is once in motion, it moveth (unless something els hinder
   482	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit) eternally; and whatsoever hindreth it, cannot in an instant, but in
   483	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttime, and by degrees quite extinguish it: And as wee see in the water,
   484	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthough the wind cease, the waves give not over rowling for a long
   485	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttime after; so also it happeneth in that motion, which is made in the
   486	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinternall parts of a man, then, when he Sees, Dreams, &c. For after the
   487	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobject is removed, or the eye shut, wee still retain an image of the
   488	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthing seen, though more obscure than when we see it. And this is it,
   489	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat Latines call Imagination, from the image made in seeing; and apply
   490	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe same, though improperly, to all the other senses. But the Greeks
   491	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcall it Fancy; which signifies Apparence, and is as proper to one sense,
   492	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas to another. Imagination therefore is nothing but Decaying Sense; and
   493	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis found in men, and many other living Creatures, as well sleeping, as
   494	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twaking.
   495	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   496	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   497	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   498	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   499	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMemory
   500	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   501	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe decay of Sense in men waking, is not the decay of the motion made in
   502	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsense; but an obscuring of it, in such manner, as the light of the Sun
   503	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobscureth the light of the Starres; which starrs do no less exercise
   504	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir vertue by which they are visible, in the day, than in the night.
   505	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut because amongst many stroaks, which our eyes, eares, and other
   506	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\torgans receive from externall bodies, the predominant onely is sensible;
   507	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore the light of the Sun being predominant, we are not affected
   508	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith the action of the starrs. And any object being removed from our
   509	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teyes, though the impression it made in us remain; yet other objects more
   510	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpresent succeeding, and working on us, the Imagination of the past is
   511	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobscured, and made weak; as the voyce of a man is in the noyse of the
   512	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tday. From whence it followeth, that the longer the time is, after the
   513	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsight, or Sense of any object, the weaker is the Imagination. For the
   514	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontinuall change of mans body, destroyes in time the parts which in
   515	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsense were moved: So that the distance of time, and of place, hath one
   516	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand the same effect in us. For as at a distance of place, that which wee
   517	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlook at, appears dimme, and without distinction of the smaller parts;
   518	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand as Voyces grow weak, and inarticulate: so also after great distance
   519	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof time, our imagination of the Past is weak; and wee lose( for example)
   520	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Cities wee have seen, many particular Streets; and of Actions, many
   521	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tparticular Circumstances. This Decaying Sense, when wee would express
   522	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe thing it self, (I mean Fancy it selfe,) wee call Imagination, as I
   523	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsaid before; But when we would express the Decay, and signifie that the
   524	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSense is fading, old, and past, it is called Memory. So that Imagination
   525	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Memory, are but one thing, which for divers considerations hath
   526	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdivers names.
   527	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   528	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMuch memory, or memory of many things, is called Experience. Againe,
   529	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tImagination being only of those things which have been formerly
   530	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tperceived by Sense, either all at once, or by parts at severall
   531	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttimes; The former, (which is the imagining the whole object, as it was
   532	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpresented to the sense) is Simple Imagination; as when one imagineth a
   533	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman, or horse, which he hath seen before. The other is Compounded; as
   534	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhen from the sight of a man at one time, and of a horse at another, we
   535	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconceive in our mind a Centaure. So when a man compoundeth the image of
   536	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this own person, with the image of the actions of an other man; as when a
   537	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman imagins himselfe a Hercules, or an Alexander, (which happeneth often
   538	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto them that are much taken with reading of Romants) it is a compound
   539	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\timagination, and properly but a Fiction of the mind. There be also other
   540	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tImaginations that rise in men, (though waking) from the great impression
   541	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmade in sense; As from gazing upon the Sun, the impression leaves an
   542	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\timage of the Sun before our eyes a long time after; and from being long
   543	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand vehemently attent upon Geometricall Figures, a man shall in the
   544	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdark, (though awake) have the Images of Lines, and Angles before his
   545	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teyes: which kind of Fancy hath no particular name; as being a thing that
   546	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdoth not commonly fall into mens discourse.
   547	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   548	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   549	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   550	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   551	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDreams
   552	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   553	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe imaginations of them that sleep, are those we call Dreams. And these
   554	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talso (as all other Imaginations) have been before, either totally, or
   555	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby parcells in the Sense. And because in sense, the Brain, and Nerves,
   556	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich are the necessary Organs of sense, are so benummed in sleep, as
   557	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot easily to be moved by the action of Externall Objects, there can
   558	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thappen in sleep, no Imagination; and therefore no Dreame, but what
   559	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tproceeds from the agitation of the inward parts of mans body; which
   560	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinward parts, for the connexion they have with the Brayn, and other
   561	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOrgans, when they be distempered, do keep the same in motion; whereby
   562	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Imaginations there formerly made, appeare as if a man were waking;
   563	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsaving that the Organs of Sense being now benummed, so as there is
   564	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tno new object, which can master and obscure them with a more vigorous
   565	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\timpression, a Dreame must needs be more cleare, in this silence of
   566	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsense, than are our waking thoughts. And hence it cometh to pass, that
   567	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit is a hard matter, and by many thought impossible to distinguish
   568	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texactly between Sense and Dreaming. For my part, when I consider, that
   569	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin Dreames, I do not often, nor constantly think of the same Persons,
   570	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPlaces, Objects, and Actions that I do waking; nor remember so long a
   571	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttrayne of coherent thoughts, Dreaming, as at other times; And because
   572	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twaking I often observe the absurdity of Dreames, but never dream of
   573	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe absurdities of my waking Thoughts; I am well satisfied, that being
   574	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tawake, I know I dreame not; though when I dreame, I think my selfe
   575	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tawake.
   576	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   577	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd seeing dreames are caused by the distemper of some of the inward
   578	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tparts of the Body; divers distempers must needs cause different Dreams.
   579	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd hence it is, that lying cold breedeth Dreams of Feare, and raiseth
   580	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe thought and Image of some fearfull object (the motion from the
   581	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbrain to the inner parts, and from the inner parts to the Brain being
   582	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treciprocall:) and that as Anger causeth heat in some parts of the Body,
   583	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhen we are awake; so when we sleep, the over heating of the same parts
   584	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcauseth Anger, and raiseth up in the brain the Imagination of an Enemy.
   585	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn the same manner; as naturall kindness, when we are awake causeth
   586	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdesire; and desire makes heat in certain other parts of the body; so
   587	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talso, too much heat in those parts, while wee sleep, raiseth in the
   588	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbrain an imagination of some kindness shewn. In summe, our Dreams are
   589	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe reverse of our waking Imaginations; The motion when we are awake,
   590	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeginning at one end; and when we Dream, at another.

   595	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tApparitions Or Visions
   596	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   597	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe most difficult discerning of a mans Dream, from his waking thoughts,
   598	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis then, when by some accident we observe not that we have slept:
   599	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich is easie to happen to a man full of fearfull thoughts; and
   600	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhose conscience is much troubled; and that sleepeth, without the
   601	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcircumstances, of going to bed, or putting off his clothes, as one that
   602	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnoddeth in a chayre. For he that taketh pains, and industriously layes
   603	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thimselfe to sleep, in case any uncouth and exorbitant fancy come unto
   604	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim, cannot easily think it other than a Dream. We read of Marcus
   605	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBrutes, (one that had his life given him by Julius Caesar, and was also
   606	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this favorite, and notwithstanding murthered him,) how at Phillipi,
   607	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe night before he gave battell to Augustus Caesar, he saw a fearfull
   608	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tapparition, which is commonly related by Historians as a Vision: but
   609	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsidering the circumstances, one may easily judge to have been but
   610	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta short Dream. For sitting in his tent, pensive and troubled with the
   611	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thorrour of his rash act, it was not hard for him, slumbering in the
   612	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcold, to dream of that which most affrighted him; which feare, as by
   613	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdegrees it made him wake; so also it must needs make the Apparition by
   614	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdegrees to vanish: And having no assurance that he slept, he could have
   615	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tno cause to think it a Dream, or any thing but a Vision. And this is no
   616	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tvery rare Accident: for even they that be perfectly awake, if they be
   617	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttimorous, and supperstitious, possessed with fearfull tales, and alone
   618	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the dark, are subject to the like fancies, and believe they see
   619	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tspirits and dead mens Ghosts walking in Churchyards; whereas it is
   620	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teither their Fancy onely, or els the knavery of such persons, as make
   621	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tuse of such superstitious feare, to pass disguised in the night, to
   622	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tplaces they would not be known to haunt.
   623	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   624	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFrom this ignorance of how to distinguish Dreams, and other strong
   625	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFancies, from vision and Sense, did arise the greatest part of the
   626	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tReligion of the Gentiles in time past, that worshipped Satyres, Fawnes,
   627	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnymphs, and the like; and now adayes the opinion than rude people have
   628	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Fayries, Ghosts, and Goblins; and of the power of Witches. For as for
   629	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWitches, I think not that their witch craft is any reall power; but yet
   630	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat they are justly punished, for the false beliefe they have, that
   631	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey can do such mischiefe, joyned with their purpose to do it if they
   632	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcan; their trade being neerer to a new Religion, than to a Craft or
   633	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tScience. And for Fayries, and walking Ghosts, the opinion of them has I
   634	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthink been on purpose, either taught, or not confuted, to keep in
   635	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcredit the use of Exorcisme, of Crosses, of holy Water, and other such
   636	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinventions of Ghostly men. Neverthelesse, there is no doubt, but God can
   637	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmake unnaturall Apparitions. But that he does it so often, as men need
   638	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto feare such things, more than they feare the stay, or change, of the
   639	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcourse of Nature, which he also can stay, and change, is no point of
   640	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChristian faith. But evill men under pretext that God can do any thing,
   641	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare so bold as to say any thing when it serves their turn, though
   642	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey think it untrue; It is the part of a wise man, to believe them no
   643	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfurther, than right reason makes that which they say, appear credible.
   644	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIf this superstitious fear of Spirits were taken away, and with it,
   645	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPrognostiques from Dreams, false Prophecies, and many other things
   646	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdepending thereon, by which, crafty ambitious persons abuse the
   647	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsimple people, men would be much more fitted than they are for civill
   648	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tObedience.
   649	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   650	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd this ought to be the work of the Schooles; but they rather nourish
   651	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch doctrine. For (not knowing what Imagination, or the Senses are),
   652	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhat they receive, they teach: some saying, that Imaginations rise of
   653	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthemselves, and have no cause: Others that they rise most commonly from
   654	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Will; and that Good thoughts are blown (inspired) into a man, by
   655	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod; and evill thoughts by the Divell: or that Good thoughts are powred
   656	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(infused) into a man, by God; and evill ones by the Divell. Some say
   657	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Senses receive the Species of things, and deliver them to the
   658	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-sense; and the Common Sense delivers them over to the Fancy, and
   659	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Fancy to the Memory, and the Memory to the Judgement, like
   660	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thanding of things from one to another, with many words making nothing

   670	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twe generally call Understanding; and is common to Man and Beast. For a
   671	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdogge by custome will understand the call, or the rating of his Master;
   672	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand so will many other Beasts. That Understanding which is peculiar to
   673	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman, is the Understanding not onely his will; but his conceptions and
   674	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthoughts, by the sequell and contexture of the names of things into
   675	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAffirmations, Negations, and other formes of Speech: And of this kinde

   680	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCHAPTER III. OF THE CONSEQUENCE OR TRAYNE OF IMAGINATIONS
   681	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   682	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   683	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBy Consequence, or Trayne of Thoughts, I understand that succession
   684	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof one Thought to another, which is called (to distinguish it from
   685	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDiscourse in words) Mentall Discourse.
   686	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   687	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhen a man thinketh on any thing whatsoever, His next Thought after, is
   688	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot altogether so casuall as it seems to be. Not every Thought to every
   689	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThought succeeds indifferently. But as wee have no Imagination, whereof
   690	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twe have not formerly had Sense, in whole, or in parts; so we have no
   691	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTransition from one Imagination to another, whereof we never had the
   692	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlike before in our Senses. The reason whereof is this. All Fancies
   693	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare Motions within us, reliques of those made in the Sense: And those
   694	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmotions that immediately succeeded one another in the sense, continue
   695	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talso together after Sense: In so much as the former comming again to
   696	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttake place, and be praedominant, the later followeth, by coherence of
   697	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe matter moved, is such manner, as water upon a plain Table is drawn
   698	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich way any one part of it is guided by the finger. But because
   699	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin sense, to one and the same thing perceived, sometimes one thing,
   700	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsometimes another succeedeth, it comes to passe in time, that in the
   701	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tImagining of any thing, there is no certainty what we shall Imagine
   702	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnext; Onely this is certain, it shall be something that succeeded the
   703	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsame before, at one time or another.
   704	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   705	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   706	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   707	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   708	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTrayne Of Thoughts Unguided
   709	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   710	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThis Trayne of Thoughts, or Mentall Discourse, is of two sorts. The
   711	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfirst is Unguided, Without Designee, and inconstant; Wherein there is no
   712	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPassionate Thought, to govern and direct those that follow, to it self,
   713	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas the end and scope of some desire, or other passion: In which case the
   714	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthoughts are said to wander, and seem impertinent one to another, as
   715	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin a Dream. Such are Commonly the thoughts of men, that are not onely
   716	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twithout company, but also without care of any thing; though even then
   717	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir Thoughts are as busie as at other times, but without harmony; as
   718	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe sound which a Lute out of tune would yeeld to any man; or in tune,
   719	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto one that could not play. And yet in this wild ranging of the mind,
   720	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta man may oft-times perceive the way of it, and the dependance of one
   721	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthought upon another. For in a Discourse of our present civill warre,
   722	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhat could seem more impertinent, than to ask (as one did) what was the
   723	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tvalue of a Roman Penny? Yet the Cohaerence to me was manifest enough.
   724	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor the Thought of the warre, introduced the Thought of the delivering
   725	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tup the King to his Enemies; The Thought of that, brought in the Thought
   726	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the delivering up of Christ; and that again the Thought of the 30
   727	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpence, which was the price of that treason: and thence easily followed
   728	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat malicious question; and all this in a moment of time; for Thought
   729	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis quick.
   730	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   731	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   732	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   733	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   734	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTrayne Of Thoughts Regulated
   735	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   736	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe second is more constant; as being Regulated by some desire, and
   737	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdesignee. For the impression made by such things as wee desire, or
   738	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfeare, is strong, and permanent, or, (if it cease for a time,) of quick
   739	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treturn: so strong it is sometimes, as to hinder and break our sleep.
   740	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFrom Desire, ariseth the Thought of some means we have seen produce the
   741	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlike of that which we ayme at; and from the thought of that, the
   742	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthought of means to that mean; and so continually, till we come to some
   743	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeginning within our own power. And because the End, by the greatnesse
   744	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the impression, comes often to mind, in case our thoughts begin to
   745	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twander, they are quickly again reduced into the way: which observed by
   746	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tone of the seven wise men, made him give men this praecept, which is
   747	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnow worne out, Respice Finem; that is to say, in all your actions,
   748	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlook often upon what you would have, as the thing that directs all your
   749	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthoughts in the way to attain it.
   750	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   751	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   752	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   753	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   754	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRemembrance
   755	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   756	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Trayn of regulated Thoughts is of two kinds; One, when of an effect
   757	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\timagined, wee seek the causes, or means that produce it: and this
   758	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis common to Man and Beast. The other is, when imagining any thing
   759	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhatsoever, wee seek all the possible effects, that can by it be
   760	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tproduced; that is to say, we imagine what we can do with it, when wee
   761	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave it. Of which I have not at any time seen any signe, but in man
   762	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tonely; for this is a curiosity hardly incident to the nature of any
   763	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tliving creature that has no other Passion but sensuall, such as are
   764	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thunger, thirst, lust, and anger. In summe, the Discourse of the Mind,
   765	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhen it is governed by designee, is nothing but Seeking, or the faculty
   766	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Invention, which the Latines call Sagacitas, and Solertia; a hunting
   767	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tout of the causes, of some effect, present or past; or of the effects,
   768	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof some present or past cause, sometimes a man seeks what he hath lost;
   769	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand from that place, and time, wherein hee misses it, his mind runs
   770	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tback, from place to place, and time to time, to find where, and when
   771	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the had it; that is to say, to find some certain, and limited time and
   772	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tplace, in which to begin a method of seeking. Again, from thence, his
   773	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthoughts run over the same places and times, to find what action, or
   774	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother occasion might make him lose it. This we call Remembrance,
   775	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor Calling to mind: the Latines call it Reminiscentia, as it were a
   776	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRe-Conning of our former actions.
   777	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   778	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSometimes a man knows a place determinate, within the compasse whereof
   779	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this is to seek; and then his thoughts run over all the parts thereof,
   780	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the same manner, as one would sweep a room, to find a jewell; or as
   781	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Spaniel ranges the field, till he find a sent; or as a man should run
   782	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tover the alphabet, to start a rime.

   786	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   787	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPrudence
   788	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   789	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSometime a man desires to know the event of an action; and then he
   790	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthinketh of some like action past, and the events thereof one after
   791	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tanother; supposing like events will follow like actions. As he that
   792	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tforesees what wil become of a Criminal, re-cons what he has seen follow
   793	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ton the like Crime before; having this order of thoughts, The Crime,
   794	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Officer, the Prison, the Judge, and the Gallowes. Which kind
   795	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof thoughts, is called Foresight, and Prudence, or Providence; and
   796	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsometimes Wisdome; though such conjecture, through the difficulty of
   797	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobserving all circumstances, be very fallacious. But this is certain; by
   798	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thow much one man has more experience of things past, than another; by
   799	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tso much also he is more Prudent, and his expectations the seldomer faile
   800	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim. The Present onely has a being in Nature; things Past have a being
   801	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the Memory onely, but things To Come have no being at all; the Future
   802	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeing but a fiction of the mind, applying the sequels of actions Past,
   803	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto the actions that are Present; which with most certainty is done by
   804	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim that has most Experience; but not with certainty enough. And though
   805	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit be called Prudence, when the Event answereth our Expectation; yet in
   806	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tits own nature, it is but Presumption. For the foresight of things to
   807	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcome, which is Providence, belongs onely to him by whose will they are
   808	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto come. From him onely, and supernaturally, proceeds Prophecy. The best
   809	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tProphet naturally is the best guesser; and the best guesser, he that is
   810	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmost versed and studied in the matters he guesses at: for he hath most
   811	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSignes to guesse by.
   812	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   813	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   814	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   815	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   816	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSignes
   817	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   818	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tA Signe, is the Event Antecedent, of the Consequent; and contrarily,
   819	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Consequent of the Antecedent, when the like Consequences have been
   820	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobserved, before: And the oftner they have been observed, the lesse
   821	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tuncertain is the Signe. And therefore he that has most experience in
   822	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tany kind of businesse, has most Signes, whereby to guesse at the Future
   823	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttime, and consequently is the most prudent: And so much more prudent
   824	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthan he that is new in that kind of business, as not to be equalled by
   825	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tany advantage of naturall and extemporary wit: though perhaps many young
   826	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen think the contrary.
   827	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   828	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNeverthelesse it is not Prudence that distinguisheth man from beast.
   829	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThere be beasts, that at a year old observe more, and pursue that which
   830	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis for their good, more prudently, than a child can do at ten.

   834	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   835	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConjecture Of The Time Past
   836	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   837	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAs Prudence is a Praesumtion of the Future, contracted from the
   838	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tExperience of time Past; So there is a Praesumtion of things Past taken
   839	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom other things (not future but) past also. For he that hath seen
   840	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby what courses and degrees, a flourishing State hath first come into
   841	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcivill warre, and then to ruine; upon the sights of the ruines of any
   842	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother State, will guesse, the like warre, and the like courses have been
   843	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere also. But his conjecture, has the same incertainty almost with the
   844	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconjecture of the Future; both being grounded onely upon Experience.
   845	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   846	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThere is no other act of mans mind, that I can remember, naturally
   847	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tplanted in him, so, as to need no other thing, to the exercise of it,
   848	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut to be born a man, and live with the use of his five Senses. Those
   849	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother Faculties, of which I shall speak by and by, and which seem proper
   850	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto man onely, are acquired, and encreased by study and industry; and of
   851	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmost men learned by instruction, and discipline; and proceed all from
   852	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe invention of Words, and Speech. For besides Sense, and Thoughts, and
   853	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Trayne of thoughts, the mind of man has no other motion; though by
   854	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe help of Speech, and Method, the same Facultyes may be improved to
   855	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch a height, as to distinguish men from all other living Creatures.
   856	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   857	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhatsoever we imagine, is Finite. Therefore there is no Idea, or
   858	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconception of anything we call Infinite. No man can have in his mind an
   859	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tImage of infinite magnitude; nor conceive the ends, and bounds of
   860	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe thing named; having no Conception of the thing, but of our own
   861	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinability. And therefore the Name of GOD is used, not to make us
   862	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconceive him; (for he is Incomprehensible; and his greatnesse, and power
   863	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare unconceivable;) but that we may honour him. Also because whatsoever
   864	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(as I said before,) we conceive, has been perceived first by sense,
   865	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teither all at once, or by parts; a man can have no thought, representing
   866	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tany thing, not subject to sense. No man therefore can conceive any
   867	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthing, but he must conceive it in some place; and indued with some
   868	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdeterminate magnitude; and which may be divided into parts; nor that any
   869	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthing is all in this place, and all in another place at the same time;
   870	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnor that two, or more things can be in one, and the same place at once:
   871	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor none of these things ever have, or can be incident to Sense; but are
   872	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tabsurd speeches, taken upon credit (without any signification at all,)
   873	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom deceived Philosophers, and deceived, or deceiving Schoolemen.

   877	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCHAPTER IV. OF SPEECH
   878	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   879	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   880	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   881	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   882	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOriginall Of Speech
   883	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   884	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Invention of Printing, though ingenious, compared with the invention
   885	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Letters, is no great matter. But who was the first that found the use
   886	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Letters, is not known. He that first brought them into Greece, men
   887	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsay was Cadmus, the sonne of Agenor, King of Phaenicia. A profitable
   888	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInvention for continuing the memory of time past, and the conjunction of
   889	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmankind, dispersed into so many, and distant regions of the Earth; and
   890	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith all difficult, as proceeding from a watchfull observation of the
   891	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdivers motions of the Tongue, Palat, Lips, and other organs of Speech;
   892	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhereby to make as many differences of characters, to remember them.
   893	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut the most noble and profitable invention of all other, was that of
   894	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSpeech, consisting of Names or Apellations, and their Connexion; whereby
   895	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen register their Thoughts; recall them when they are past; and also
   896	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdeclare them one to another for mutuall utility and conversation;
   897	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twithout which, there had been amongst men, neither Common-wealth, nor
   898	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSociety, nor Contract, nor Peace, no more than amongst Lyons, Bears,
   899	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Wolves. The first author of Speech was GOD himselfe, that instructed
   900	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAdam how to name such creatures as he presented to his sight; For the
   901	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tScripture goeth no further in this matter. But this was sufficient
   902	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto direct him to adde more names, as the experience and use of the
   903	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcreatures should give him occasion; and to joyn them in such manner by
   904	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdegrees, as to make himselfe understood; and so by succession of time,
   905	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tso much language might be gotten, as he had found use for; though not so
   906	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcopious, as an Orator or Philosopher has need of. For I do not find any
   907	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthing in the Scripture, out of which, directly or by consequence can
   908	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe gathered, that Adam was taught the names of all Figures, Numbers,
   909	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMeasures, Colours, Sounds, Fancies, Relations; much less the names
   910	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Words and Speech, as Generall, Speciall, Affirmative, Negative,
   911	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInterrogative, Optative, Infinitive, all which are usefull; and least of
   912	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall, of Entity, Intentionality, Quiddity, and other significant words of
   913	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe School.
   914	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   915	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut all this language gotten, and augmented by Adam and his posterity,
   916	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas again lost at the tower of Babel, when by the hand of God, every man
   917	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas stricken for his rebellion, with an oblivion of his former language.
   918	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd being hereby forced to disperse themselves into severall parts of
   919	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe world, it must needs be, that the diversity of Tongues that now is,
   920	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tproceeded by degrees from them, in such manner, as need (the mother of
   921	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall inventions) taught them; and in tract of time grew every where more
   922	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcopious.
   923	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   924	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   925	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   926	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   927	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Use Of Speech
   928	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   929	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe generall use of Speech, is to transferre our Mentall Discourse, into
   930	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tVerbal; or the Trayne of our Thoughts, into a Trayne of Words; and that
   931	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor two commodities; whereof one is, the Registring of the Consequences
   932	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof our Thoughts; which being apt to slip out of our memory, and put
   933	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tus to a new labour, may again be recalled, by such words as they were
   934	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmarked by. So that the first use of names, is to serve for Markes,
   935	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor Notes of remembrance. Another is, when many use the same words,
   936	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto signifie (by their connexion and order,) one to another, what they
   937	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconceive, or think of each matter; and also what they desire, feare,
   938	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor have any other passion for, and for this use they are called
   939	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSignes. Speciall uses of Speech are these; First, to Register, what by
   940	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcogitation, wee find to be the cause of any thing, present or past; and
   941	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhat we find things present or past may produce, or effect: which in
   942	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsumme, is acquiring of Arts. Secondly, to shew to others that knowledge
   943	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich we have attained; which is, to Counsell, and Teach one another.
   944	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThirdly, to make known to others our wills, and purposes, that we may
   945	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave the mutuall help of one another. Fourthly, to please and delight
   946	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tour selves, and others, by playing with our words, for pleasure or
   947	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tornament, innocently.
   948	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   949	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   950	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   951	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   952	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAbuses Of Speech
   953	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   954	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo these Uses, there are also foure correspondent Abuses. First,
   955	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhen men register their thoughts wrong, by the inconstancy of the
   956	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsignification of their words; by which they register for their
   957	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconceptions, that which they never conceived; and so deceive themselves.
   958	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSecondly, when they use words metaphorically; that is, in other sense
   959	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthan that they are ordained for; and thereby deceive others. Thirdly,
   960	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhen by words they declare that to be their will, which is not.
   961	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFourthly, when they use them to grieve one another: for seeing nature
   962	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thath armed living creatures, some with teeth, some with horns, and some
   963	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith hands, to grieve an enemy, it is but an abuse of Speech, to grieve
   964	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim with the tongue, unlesse it be one whom wee are obliged to govern;
   965	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand then it is not to grieve, but to correct and amend.
   966	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   967	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe manner how Speech serveth to the remembrance of the consequence
   968	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof causes and effects, consisteth in the imposing of Names, and the
   969	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConnexion of them.
   970	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   971	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   972	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   973	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   974	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNames Proper & Common Universall
   975	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   976	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf Names, some are Proper, and singular to one onely thing; as Peter,
   977	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJohn, This Man, This Tree: and some are Common to many things; as Man,
   978	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHorse, Tree; every of which though but one Name, is nevertheless the
   979	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tname of divers particular things; in respect of all which together, it
   980	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis called an Universall; there being nothing in the world Universall
   981	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut Names; for the things named, are every one of them Individual and
   982	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSingular.
   983	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   984	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOne Universall name is imposed on many things, for their similitude in
   985	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsome quality, or other accident: And whereas a Proper Name bringeth to
   986	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmind one thing onely; Universals recall any one of those many.
   987	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   988	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd of Names Universall, some are of more, and some of lesse extent; the
   989	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlarger comprehending the lesse large: and some again of equall extent,
   990	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcomprehending each other reciprocally. As for example, the Name Body is
   991	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof larger signification than the word Man, and conprehendeth it; and the
   992	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnames Man and Rationall, are of equall extent, comprehending mutually
   993	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tone another. But here wee must take notice, that by a Name is not
   994	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talwayes understood, as in Grammar, one onely word; but sometimes by
   995	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcircumlocution many words together. For all these words, Hee That In
   996	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHis Actions Observeth The Lawes Of His Country, make but one Name,
   997	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tequivalent to this one word, Just.
   998	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
   999	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBy this imposition of Names, some of larger, some of stricter
  1000	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsignification, we turn the reckoning of the consequences of things
  1001	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\timagined in the mind, into a reckoning of the consequences of
  1002	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAppellations. For example, a man that hath no use of Speech at all,
  1003	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(such, as is born and remains perfectly deafe and dumb,) if he set
  1004	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbefore his eyes a triangle, and by it two right angles, (such as are the
  1005	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcorners of a square figure,) he may by meditation compare and find, that
  1006	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe three angles of that triangle, are equall to those two right angles
  1007	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat stand by it. But if another triangle be shewn him different in
  1008	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshape from the former, he cannot know without a new labour, whether the
  1009	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthree angles of that also be equall to the same. But he that hath the
  1010	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tuse of words, when he observes, that such equality was consequent, not
  1011	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto the length of the sides, nor to any other particular thing in his
  1012	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttriangle; but onely to this, that the sides were straight, and the
  1013	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tangles three; and that that was all, for which he named it a Triangle;
  1014	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twill boldly conclude Universally, that such equality of angles is in
  1015	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall triangles whatsoever; and register his invention in these generall
  1016	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttermes, Every Triangle Hath Its Three Angles Equall To Two Right Angles.
  1017	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd thus the consequence found in one particular, comes to be registred
  1018	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand remembred, as a Universall rule; and discharges our mentall
  1019	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treckoning, of time and place; and delivers us from all labour of the
  1020	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmind, saving the first; and makes that which was found true Here, and
  1021	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNow, to be true in All Times and Places.
  1022	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1023	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut the use of words in registring our thoughts, is in nothing so
  1024	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevident as in Numbering. A naturall foole that could never learn by
  1025	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\theart the order of numerall words, as One, Two, and Three, may observe
  1026	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevery stroak of the Clock, and nod to it, or say one, one, one; but can
  1027	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnever know what houre it strikes. And it seems, there was a time when
  1028	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose names of number were not in use; and men were fayn to apply their
  1029	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfingers of one or both hands, to those things they desired to keep
  1030	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\taccount of; and that thence it proceeded, that now our numerall words
  1031	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare but ten, in any Nation, and in some but five, and then they begin
  1032	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagain. And he that can tell ten, if he recite them out of order, will
  1033	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlose himselfe, and not know when he has done: Much lesse will he be
  1034	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\table to add, and substract, and performe all other operations of
  1035	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tArithmetique. So that without words, there is no possibility of
  1036	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treckoning of Numbers; much lesse of Magnitudes, of Swiftnesse, of Force,
  1037	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand other things, the reckonings whereof are necessary to the being, or
  1038	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twell-being of man-kind.
  1039	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1040	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhen two Names are joyned together into a Consequence, or Affirmation;
  1041	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas thus, A Man Is A Living Creature; or thus, If He Be A Man, He Is A
  1042	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLiving Creature, If the later name Living Creature, signifie all that
  1043	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe former name Man signifieth, then the affirmation, or consequence is
  1044	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTrue; otherwise False. For True and False are attributes of Speech, not
  1045	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof things. And where Speech in not, there is neither Truth nor Falshood.
  1046	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tErrour there may be, as when wee expect that which shall not be; or
  1047	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuspect what has not been: but in neither case can a man be charged with
  1048	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tUntruth.
  1049	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1050	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSeeing then that Truth consisteth in the right ordering of names in our
  1051	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\taffirmations, a man that seeketh precise Truth, had need to remember
  1052	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhat every name he uses stands for; and to place it accordingly; or els
  1053	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the will find himselfe entangled in words, as a bird in lime-twiggs; the
  1054	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmore he struggles, the more belimed. And therefore in Geometry, (which
  1055	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis the onely Science that it hath pleased God hitherto to bestow on
  1056	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmankind,) men begin at settling the significations of their words; which
  1057	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsettling of significations, they call Definitions; and place them in the
  1058	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeginning of their reckoning.

  1060	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBy this it appears how necessary it is for any man that aspires to true
  1061	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKnowledge, to examine the Definitions of former Authors; and either
  1062	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto correct them, where they are negligently set down; or to make them
  1063	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thimselfe. For the errours of Definitions multiply themselves, according
  1064	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas the reckoning proceeds; and lead men into absurdities, which at last
  1065	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey see, but cannot avoyd, without reckoning anew from the beginning;
  1066	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin which lyes the foundation of their errours. From whence it happens,
  1067	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat they which trust to books, do as they that cast up many little
  1068	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsumms into a greater, without considering whether those little summes
  1069	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere rightly cast up or not; and at last finding the errour visible,
  1070	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand not mistrusting their first grounds, know not which way to cleere
  1071	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthemselves; but spend time in fluttering over their bookes; as birds
  1072	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat entring by the chimney, and finding themselves inclosed in a
  1073	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tchamber, flitter at the false light of a glasse window, for want of wit
  1074	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto consider which way they came in. So that in the right Definition
  1075	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Names, lyes the first use of Speech; which is the Acquisition of
  1076	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tScience: And in wrong, or no Definitions' lyes the first abuse; from
  1077	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich proceed all false and senslesse Tenets; which make those men that
  1078	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttake their instruction from the authority of books, and not from their
  1079	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\town meditation, to be as much below the condition of ignorant men, as
  1080	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen endued with true Science are above it. For between true Science,
  1081	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand erroneous Doctrines, Ignorance is in the middle. Naturall sense and
  1082	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\timagination, are not subject to absurdity. Nature it selfe cannot erre:
  1083	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand as men abound in copiousnesse of language; so they become more wise,
  1084	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor more mad than ordinary. Nor is it possible without Letters for any
  1085	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman to become either excellently wise, or (unless his memory be hurt by
  1086	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdisease, or ill constitution of organs) excellently foolish. For words
  1087	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare wise mens counters, they do but reckon by them: but they are the
  1088	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmony of fooles, that value them by the authority of an Aristotle, a
  1089	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCicero, or a Thomas, or any other Doctor whatsoever, if but a man.

  1094	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSubject To Names
  1095	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1096	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSubject To Names, is whatsoever can enter into, or be considered in an
  1097	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\taccount; and be added one to another to make a summe; or substracted one
  1098	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom another, and leave a remainder. The Latines called Accounts of mony
  1099	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRationes, and accounting, Ratiocinatio: and that which we in bills or
  1100	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbooks of account call Items, they called Nomina; that is, Names: and
  1101	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthence it seems to proceed, that they extended the word Ratio, to the
  1102	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfaculty of Reckoning in all other things. The Greeks have but one word
  1103	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLogos, for both Speech and Reason; not that they thought there was no
  1104	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSpeech without Reason; but no Reasoning without Speech: And the act of
  1105	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treasoning they called syllogisme; which signifieth summing up of the
  1106	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsequences of one saying to another. And because the same things may
  1107	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tenter into account for divers accidents; their names are (to shew that
  1108	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdiversity) diversly wrested, and diversified. This diversity of names
  1109	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmay be reduced to foure generall heads.
  1110	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1111	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFirst, a thing may enter into account for Matter, or Body; as Living,
  1112	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSensible, Rationall, Hot, Cold, Moved, Quiet; with all which names the
  1113	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tword Matter, or Body is understood; all such, being names of Matter.
  1114	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1115	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSecondly, it may enter into account, or be considered, for some accident
  1116	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor quality, which we conceive to be in it; as for Being Moved, for Being
  1117	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSo Long, for Being Hot, &c; and then, of the name of the thing it selfe,
  1118	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby a little change or wresting, wee make a name for that accident, which
  1119	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twe consider; and for Living put into account Life; for Moved, Motion;
  1120	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor Hot, Heat; for Long, Length, and the like. And all such Names, are
  1121	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe names of the accidents and properties, by which one Matter, and Body
  1122	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis distinguished from another. These are called Names Abstract; Because
  1123	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSevered (not from Matter, but) from the account of Matter.
  1124	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1125	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThirdly, we bring into account, the Properties of our own bodies,
  1126	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhereby we make such distinction: as when any thing is Seen by us, we
  1127	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treckon not the thing it selfe; but the Sight, the Colour, the Idea of
  1128	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit in the fancy: and when any thing is Heard, wee reckon it not; but the
  1129	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHearing, or Sound onely, which is our fancy or conception of it by the
  1130	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEare: and such are names of fancies.
  1131	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1132	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFourthly, we bring into account, consider, and give names, to Names
  1133	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthemselves, and to Speeches: For, Generall, Universall, Speciall,
  1134	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOequivocall, are names of Names. And Affirmation, Interrogation,
  1135	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommandement, Narration, Syllogisme, Sermon, Oration, and many other
  1136	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch, are names of Speeches.

  1142	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1143	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd this is all the variety of Names Positive; which are put to mark
  1144	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsomewhat which is in Nature, or may be feigned by the mind of man, as
  1145	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBodies that are, or may be conceived to be; or of bodies, the Properties
  1146	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat are, or may be feigned to be; or Words and Speech.

  1151	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNegative Names With Their Uses
  1152	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1153	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThere be also other Names, called Negative; which are notes to signifie
  1154	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat a word is not the name of the thing in question; as these words
  1155	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNothing, No Man, Infinite, Indocible, Three Want Foure, and the
  1156	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlike; which are nevertheless of use in reckoning, or in correcting of
  1157	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treckoning; and call to mind our past cogitations, though they be not
  1158	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnames of any thing; because they make us refuse to admit of Names not
  1159	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trightly used.
  1160	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t

  1163	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1164	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWords Insignificant
  1165	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1166	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAll other names, are but insignificant sounds; and those of two
  1167	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsorts. One, when they are new, and yet their meaning not explained by
  1168	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDefinition; whereof there have been aboundance coyned by Schoole-men,
  1169	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand pusled Philosophers.
  1170	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1171	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnother, when men make a name of two Names, whose significations are
  1172	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontradictory and inconsistent; as this name, an Incorporeall Body, or
  1173	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(which is all one) an Incorporeall Substance, and a great number more.
  1174	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor whensoever any affirmation is false, the two names of which it
  1175	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis composed, put together and made one, signifie nothing at all. For
  1176	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texample if it be a false affirmation to say A Quadrangle Is Round,
  1177	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe word Round Quadrangle signifies nothing; but is a meere sound. So
  1178	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlikewise if it be false, to say that vertue can be powred, or blown up
  1179	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand down; the words In-powred Vertue, In-blown Vertue, are as absurd
  1180	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand insignificant, as a Round Quadrangle. And therefore you shall hardly
  1181	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmeet with a senselesse and insignificant word, that is not made up of
  1182	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsome Latin or Greek names. A Frenchman seldome hears our Saviour called
  1183	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby the name of Parole, but by the name of Verbe often; yet Verbe and
  1184	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tParole differ no more, but that one is Latin, the other French.
  1185	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1186	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1187	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1188	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1189	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tUnderstanding
  1190	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1191	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhen a man upon the hearing of any Speech, hath those thoughts which the
  1192	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twords of that Speech, and their connexion, were ordained and constituted
  1193	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto signifie; Then he is said to understand it; Understanding being
  1194	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnothing els, but conception caused by Speech. And therefore if Speech
  1195	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe peculiar to man (as for ought I know it is,) then is Understanding
  1196	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpeculiar to him also. And therefore of absurd and false affirmations,
  1197	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin case they be universall, there can be no Understanding; though many
  1198	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthink they understand, then, when they do but repeat the words softly,
  1199	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor con them in their mind.
  1200	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1201	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhat kinds of Speeches signifie the Appetites, Aversions, and Passions
  1202	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof mans mind; and of their use and abuse, I shall speak when I have
  1203	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tspoken of the Passions.
  1204	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t

  1207	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1208	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInconstant Names
  1209	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1210	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe names of such things as affect us, that is, which please, and
  1211	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdisplease us, because all men be not alike affected with the same thing,
  1212	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnor the same man at all times, are in the common discourses of men, of
  1213	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInconstant signification. For seeing all names are imposed to signifie
  1214	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tour conceptions; and all our affections are but conceptions; when we
  1215	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconceive the same things differently, we can hardly avoyd different
  1216	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnaming of them. For though the nature of that we conceive, be the
  1217	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsame; yet the diversity of our reception of it, in respect of different
  1218	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconstitutions of body, and prejudices of opinion, gives everything a
  1219	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttincture of our different passions. And therefore in reasoning, a man
  1220	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbust take heed of words; which besides the signification of what we
  1221	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\timagine of their nature, disposition, and interest of the speaker; such
  1222	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas are the names of Vertues, and Vices; For one man calleth Wisdome,
  1223	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhat another calleth Feare; and one Cruelty, what another Justice;
  1224	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tone Prodigality, what another Magnanimity; one Gravity, what another
  1225	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tStupidity, &c. And therefore such names can never be true grounds of any
  1226	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tratiocination. No more can Metaphors, and Tropes of speech: but these
  1227	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare less dangerous, because they profess their inconstancy; which the
  1228	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother do not.

  1237	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tReason What It Is
  1238	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1239	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhen a man Reasoneth, hee does nothing els but conceive a summe totall,
  1240	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom Addition of parcels; or conceive a Remainder, from Substraction of
  1241	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tone summe from another: which (if it be done by Words,) is conceiving of
  1242	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe consequence of the names of all the parts, to the name of the whole;
  1243	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor from the names of the whole and one part, to the name of the other
  1244	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpart. And though in some things, (as in numbers,) besides Adding and
  1245	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSubstracting, men name other operations, as Multiplying and Dividing;
  1246	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tyet they are the same; for Multiplication, is but Addition together of
  1247	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthings equall; and Division, but Substracting of one thing, as often as
  1248	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twe can. These operations are not incident to Numbers onely, but to
  1249	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall manner of things that can be added together, and taken one out of
  1250	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tanother. For as Arithmeticians teach to adde and substract in Numbers;
  1251	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tso the Geometricians teach the same in Lines, Figures (solid and
  1252	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuperficiall,) Angles, Proportions, Times, degrees of Swiftnesse, Force,
  1253	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPower, and the like; The Logicians teach the same in Consequences
  1254	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf Words; adding together Two Names, to make an Affirmation; and Two
  1255	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAffirmations, to make a syllogisme; and Many syllogismes to make a
  1256	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDemonstration; and from the Summe, or Conclusion of a syllogisme, they
  1257	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsubstract one Proposition, to finde the other. Writers of Politiques,
  1258	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tadde together Pactions, to find mens Duties; and Lawyers, Lawes and
  1259	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFacts, to find what is Right and Wrong in the actions of private men.
  1260	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn summe, in what matter soever there is place for Addition and
  1261	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSubstraction, there also is place for Reason; and where these have no
  1262	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tplace, there Reason has nothing at all to do.

  1269	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOut of all which we may define, (that is to say determine,) what that
  1270	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis, which is meant by this word Reason, when wee reckon it amongst
  1271	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Faculties of the mind. For Reason, in this sense, is nothing but
  1272	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tReckoning (that is, Adding and Substracting) of the Consequences of
  1273	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgenerall names agreed upon, for the Marking and Signifying of our
  1274	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthoughts; I say Marking them, when we reckon by our selves; and
  1275	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSignifying, when we demonstrate, or approve our reckonings to other men.

  1280	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRight Reason Where
  1281	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1282	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd as in Arithmetique, unpractised men must, and Professors themselves
  1283	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmay often erre, and cast up false; so also in any other subject of
  1284	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tReasoning, the ablest, most attentive, and most practised men, may
  1285	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdeceive themselves, and inferre false Conclusions; Not but that Reason
  1286	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit selfe is always Right Reason, as well as Arithmetique is a certain
  1287	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand infallible art: But no one mans Reason, nor the Reason of any
  1288	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tone number of men, makes the certaintie; no more than an account is
  1289	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore well cast up, because a great many men have unanimously
  1290	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tapproved it. And therfore, as when there is a controversy in an account,
  1291	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe parties must by their own accord, set up for right Reason, the
  1292	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tReason of some Arbitrator, or Judge, to whose sentence they will
  1293	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tboth stand, or their controversie must either come to blowes, or be
  1294	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tundecided, for want of a right Reason constituted by Nature; so is
  1295	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit also in all debates of what kind soever: And when men that think
  1296	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthemselves wiser than all others, clamor and demand right Reason for
  1297	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tjudge; yet seek no more, but that things should be determined, by no
  1298	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother mens reason but their own, it is as intolerable in the society of
  1299	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen, as it is in play after trump is turned, to use for trump on every
  1300	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\toccasion, that suite whereof they have most in their hand. For they do
  1301	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnothing els, that will have every of their passions, as it comes to
  1302	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbear sway in them, to be taken for right Reason, and that in their own
  1303	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontroversies: bewraying their want of right Reason, by the claym they

  1310	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1311	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Use and End of Reason, is not the finding of the summe, and truth
  1312	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof one, or a few consequences, remote from the first definitions, and
  1313	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsettled significations of names; but to begin at these; and proceed from
  1314	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tone consequence to another. For there can be no certainty of the last
  1315	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConclusion, without a certainty of all those Affirmations and Negations,
  1316	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ton which it was grounded, and inferred. As when a master of a family,
  1317	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin taking an account, casteth up the summs of all the bills of expence,
  1318	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinto one sum; and not regarding how each bill is summed up, by those
  1319	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat give them in account; nor what it is he payes for; he advantages
  1320	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thimselfe no more, than if he allowed the account in grosse, trusting to
  1321	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevery of the accountants skill and honesty; so also in Reasoning of all
  1322	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother things, he that takes up conclusions on the trust of Authors, and
  1323	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdoth not fetch them from the first Items in every Reckoning, (which are
  1324	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe significations of names settled by definitions), loses his labour;
  1325	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand does not know any thing; but onely beleeveth.

  1330	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf Error And Absurdity
  1331	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1332	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhen a man reckons without the use of words, which may be done in
  1333	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tparticular things, (as when upon the sight of any one thing, wee
  1334	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconjecture what was likely to have preceded, or is likely to follow upon
  1335	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit;) if that which he thought likely to follow, followes not; or that
  1336	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich he thought likely to have preceded it, hath not preceded it, this
  1337	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis called ERROR; to which even the most prudent men are subject. But
  1338	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhen we Reason in Words of generall signification, and fall upon a
  1339	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgenerall inference which is false; though it be commonly called Error,
  1340	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit is indeed an ABSURDITY, or senseless Speech. For Error is but a
  1341	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdeception, in presuming that somewhat is past, or to come; of which,
  1342	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthough it were not past, or not to come; yet there was no impossibility
  1343	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdiscoverable. But when we make a generall assertion, unlesse it be a
  1344	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttrue one, the possibility of it is unconceivable. And words whereby we
  1345	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconceive nothing but the sound, are those we call Absurd, insignificant,
  1346	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Non-sense. And therefore if a man should talk to me of a Round
  1347	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tQuadrangle; or Accidents Of Bread In Cheese; or Immaterial Substances;
  1348	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor of A Free Subject; A Free Will; or any Free, but free from being
  1349	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thindred by opposition, I should not say he were in an Errour; but that
  1350	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this words were without meaning; that is to say, Absurd.
  1351	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1352	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tI have said before, (in the second chapter,) that a Man did excell
  1353	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall other Animals in this faculty, that when he conceived any thing
  1354	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhatsoever, he was apt to enquire the consequences of it, and what
  1355	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teffects he could do with it. And now I adde this other degree of the
  1356	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsame excellence, that he can by words reduce the consequences he findes
  1357	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto generall Rules, called Theoremes, or Aphorismes; that is, he can
  1358	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tReason, or reckon, not onely in number; but in all other things, whereof
  1359	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tone may be added unto, or substracted from another.
  1360	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1361	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut this priviledge, is allayed by another; and that is, by the
  1362	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpriviledge of Absurdity; to which no living creature is subject, but man
  1363	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tonely. And of men, those are of all most subject to it, that professe
  1364	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPhilosophy. For it is most true that Cicero sayth of them somewhere;
  1365	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat there can be nothing so absurd, but may be found in the books of
  1366	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPhilosophers. And the reason is manifest. For there is not one of them
  1367	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat begins his ratiocination from the Definitions, or Explications of
  1368	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe names they are to use; which is a method that hath been used onely
  1369	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin Geometry; whose Conclusions have thereby been made indisputable.
  1370	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1371	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1372	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1373	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1374	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCauses Of Absurditie
  1375	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1376	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe first cause of Absurd conclusions I ascribe to the want of Method;
  1377	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin that they begin not their Ratiocination from Definitions; that
  1378	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis, from settled significations of their words: as if they could cast
  1379	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\taccount, without knowing the value of the numerall words, One, Two, and
  1380	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThree.
  1381	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1382	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd whereas all bodies enter into account upon divers considerations,
  1383	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(which I have mentioned in the precedent chapter;) these considerations
  1384	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeing diversly named, divers absurdities proceed from the confusion, and
  1385	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunfit connexion of their names into assertions. And therefore
  1386	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1387	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe second cause of Absurd assertions, I ascribe to the giving of names
  1388	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Bodies, to Accidents; or of Accidents, to Bodies; As they do, that
  1389	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsay, Faith Is Infused, or Inspired; when nothing can be Powred, or
  1390	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBreathed into any thing, but body; and that, Extension is Body; that
  1391	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPhantasmes are Spirits, &c.
  1392	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1393	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe third I ascribe to the giving of the names of the Accidents of
  1394	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBodies Without Us, to the Accidents of our Own Bodies; as they do that
  1395	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsay, the Colour Is In The Body; The Sound Is In The Ayre, &c.
  1396	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1397	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe fourth, to the giving of the names of Bodies, to Names, or Speeches;
  1398	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas they do that say, that There Be Things Universall; that A Living
  1399	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCreature Is Genus, or A Generall Thing, &c.
  1400	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1401	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe fifth, to the giving of the names of Accidents, to Names and
  1402	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSpeeches; as they do that say, The Nature Of A Thing Is In Its
  1403	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDefinition; A Mans Command Is His Will; and the like.
  1404	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1405	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe sixth, to the use of Metaphors, Tropes, and other Rhetoricall
  1406	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfigures, in stead of words proper. For though it be lawfull to say, (for
  1407	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texample) in common speech, The Way Goeth, Or Leadeth Hither, Or Thither,
  1408	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Proverb Sayes This Or That (whereas wayes cannot go, nor Proverbs
  1409	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tspeak;) yet in reckoning, and seeking of truth, such speeches are not to
  1410	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe admitted.
  1411	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1412	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe seventh, to names that signifie nothing; but are taken up, and
  1413	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlearned by rote from the Schooles, as Hypostatical, Transubstantiate,
  1414	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConsubstantiate, Eternal-now, and the like canting of Schoole-men.
  1415	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1416	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo him that can avoyd these things, it is not easie to fall into any
  1417	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tabsurdity, unlesse it be by the length of an account; wherein he may
  1418	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tperhaps forget what went before. For all men by nature reason alike, and
  1419	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twell, when they have good principles. For who is so stupid, as both to
  1420	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmistake in Geometry, and also to persist in it, when another detects his
  1421	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\terror to him?
  1422	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1423	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1424	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1425	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1426	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tScience
  1427	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1428	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBy this it appears that Reason is not as Sense, and Memory, borne with
  1429	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tus; nor gotten by Experience onely; as Prudence is; but attayned by
  1430	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIndustry; first in apt imposing of Names; and secondly by getting a good
  1431	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand orderly Method in proceeding from the Elements, which are Names,
  1432	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto Assertions made by Connexion of one of them to another; and so to
  1433	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsyllogismes, which are the Connexions of one Assertion to another, till
  1434	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twe come to a knowledge of all the Consequences of names appertaining to
  1435	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe subject in hand; and that is it, men call SCIENCE. And whereas
  1436	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSense and Memory are but knowledge of Fact, which is a thing past, and
  1437	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tirrevocable; Science is the knowledge of Consequences, and dependance
  1438	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof one fact upon another: by which, out of that we can presently do, we
  1439	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tknow how to do something els when we will, or the like, another time;
  1440	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBecause when we see how any thing comes about, upon what causes, and by
  1441	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhat manner; when the like causes come into our power, wee see how to
  1442	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmake it produce the like effects.
  1443	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1444	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChildren therefore are not endued with Reason at all, till they have
  1445	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tattained the use of Speech: but are called Reasonable Creatures, for the
  1446	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpossibility apparent of having the use of Reason in time to come. And
  1447	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe most part of men, though they have the use of Reasoning a little
  1448	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tway, as in numbring to some degree; yet it serves them to little use in
  1449	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommon life; in which they govern themselves, some better, some worse,
  1450	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\taccording to their differences of experience, quicknesse of memory, and
  1451	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinclinations to severall ends; but specially according to good or evill
  1452	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfortune, and the errors of one another. For as for Science, or certain
  1453	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trules of their actions, they are so farre from it, that they know
  1454	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot what it is. Geometry they have thought Conjuring: but for other
  1455	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSciences, they who have not been taught the beginnings, and some
  1456	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprogresse in them, that they may see how they be acquired and generated,
  1457	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare in this point like children, that having no thought of generation,
  1458	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare made believe by the women, that their brothers and sisters are not
  1459	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tborn, but found in the garden.
  1460	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1461	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut yet they that have no Science, are in better, and nobler condition
  1462	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith their naturall Prudence; than men, that by mis-reasoning, or by
  1463	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttrusting them that reason wrong, fall upon false and absurd generall
  1464	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trules. For ignorance of causes, and of rules, does not set men so farre
  1465	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tout of their way, as relying on false rules, and taking for causes of
  1466	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhat they aspire to, those that are not so, but rather causes of the
  1467	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontrary.
  1468	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1469	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo conclude, The Light of humane minds is Perspicuous Words, but by
  1470	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texact definitions first snuffed, and purged from ambiguity; Reason is
  1471	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Pace; Encrease of Science, the Way; and the Benefit of man-kind, the
  1472	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEnd. And on the contrary, Metaphors, and senslesse and ambiguous words,
  1473	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare like Ignes Fatui; and reasoning upon them, is wandering amongst
  1474	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinnumerable absurdities; and their end, contention, and sedition, or
  1475	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontempt.
  1476	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t

  1479	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1480	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPrudence & Sapience, With Their Difference
  1481	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1482	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAs, much Experience, is Prudence; so, is much Science, Sapience. For
  1483	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthough wee usually have one name of Wisedome for them both; yet
  1484	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Latines did always distinguish between Prudentia and Sapientia,
  1485	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tascribing the former to Experience, the later to Science. But to make
  1486	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir difference appeare more cleerly, let us suppose one man endued
  1487	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith an excellent naturall use, and dexterity in handling his armes; and
  1488	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tanother to have added to that dexterity, an acquired Science, of where
  1489	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the can offend, or be offended by his adversarie, in every possible
  1490	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tposture, or guard: The ability of the former, would be to the ability
  1491	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the later, as Prudence to Sapience; both usefull; but the later
  1492	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinfallible. But they that trusting onely to the authority of books,
  1493	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfollow the blind blindly, are like him that trusting to the false rules
  1494	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the master of fence, ventures praesumptuously upon an adversary, that
  1495	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teither kills, or disgraces him.

  1499	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1500	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSignes Of Science
  1501	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1502	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe signes of Science, are some, certain and infallible; some,
  1503	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tuncertain. Certain, when he that pretendeth the Science of any thing,
  1504	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcan teach the same; that is to say, demonstrate the truth thereof
  1505	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tperspicuously to another: Uncertain, when onely some particular events
  1506	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tanswer to his pretence, and upon many occasions prove so as he sayes
  1507	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey must. Signes of prudence are all uncertain; because to observe by
  1508	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texperience, and remember all circumstances that may alter the successe,
  1509	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis impossible. But in any businesse, whereof a man has not infallible
  1510	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tScience to proceed by; to forsake his own natural judgement, and be
  1511	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tguided by generall sentences read in Authors, and subject to many
  1512	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texceptions, is a signe of folly, and generally scorned by the name of
  1513	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPedantry. And even of those men themselves, that in Councells of the
  1514	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth, love to shew their reading of Politiques and History,
  1515	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tvery few do it in their domestique affaires, where their particular
  1516	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinterest is concerned; having Prudence enough for their private
  1517	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\taffaires: but in publique they study more the reputation of their owne
  1518	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twit, than the successe of anothers businesse.

  1523	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1524	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCOMMONLY CALLED THE PASSIONS. AND THE SPEECHES BY WHICH THEY ARE
  1525	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEXPRESSED.
  1526	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1527	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1528	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1529	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1530	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMotion Vitall And Animal
  1531	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1532	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThere be in Animals, two sorts of Motions peculiar to them: One called
  1533	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tVitall; begun in generation, and continued without interruption through
  1534	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir whole life; such as are the Course of the Bloud, the Pulse, the
  1535	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBreathing, the Concoctions, Nutrition, Excretion, &c; to which Motions
  1536	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere needs no help of Imagination: The other in Animal Motion,
  1537	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\totherwise called Voluntary Motion; as to Go, to Speak, to Move any of
  1538	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tour limbes, in such manner as is first fancied in our minds. That Sense,
  1539	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis Motion in the organs and interiour parts of mans body, caused by
  1540	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe action of the things we See, Heare, &c.; And that Fancy is but the
  1541	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tReliques of the same Motion, remaining after Sense, has been already
  1542	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsayd in the first and second Chapters. And because Going, Speaking, and
  1543	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe like Voluntary motions, depend alwayes upon a precedent thought of
  1544	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhither, Which Way, and What; it is evident, that the Imagination is
  1545	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe first internall beginning of all Voluntary Motion. And although
  1546	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunstudied men, doe not conceive any motion at all to be there, where
  1547	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe thing moved is invisible; or the space it is moved in, is (for the
  1548	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshortnesse of it) insensible; yet that doth not hinder, but that such
  1549	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMotions are. For let a space be never so little, that which is moved
  1550	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tover a greater space, whereof that little one is part, must first be
  1551	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmoved over that. These small beginnings of Motion, within the body
  1552	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Man, before they appear in walking, speaking, striking, and other
  1553	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tvisible actions, are commonly called ENDEAVOUR.
  1554	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1555	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1556	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1557	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1558	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEndeavour; Appetite; Desire; Hunger; Thirst; Aversion
  1559	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1560	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThis Endeavour, when it is toward something which causes it, is called
  1561	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAPPETITE, or DESIRE; the later, being the generall name; and the other,
  1562	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\toftentimes restrayned to signifie the Desire of Food, namely Hunger and
  1563	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThirst. And when the Endeavour is fromward something, it is generally
  1564	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcalled AVERSION. These words Appetite, and Aversion we have from the
  1565	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLatines; and they both of them signifie the motions, one of approaching,
  1566	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe other of retiring. So also do the Greek words for the same, which
  1567	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare orme and aphorme. For nature it selfe does often presse upon men
  1568	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose truths, which afterwards, when they look for somewhat beyond
  1569	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNature, they stumble at. For the Schooles find in meere Appetite to go,
  1570	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor move, no actuall Motion at all: but because some Motion they must
  1571	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tacknowledge, they call it Metaphoricall Motion; which is but an absurd
  1572	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tspeech; for though Words may be called metaphoricall; Bodies, and
  1573	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMotions cannot.
  1574	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1575	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThat which men Desire, they are also sayd to LOVE; and to HATE those
  1576	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthings, for which they have Aversion. So that Desire, and Love, are the
  1577	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsame thing; save that by Desire, we alwayes signifie the Absence of
  1578	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe object; by Love, most commonly the Presence of the same. So also

  1580	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tObject.
  1581	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1582	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf Appetites, and Aversions, some are born with men; as Appetite of
  1583	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfood, Appetite of excretion, and exoneration, (which may also and more
  1584	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tproperly be called Aversions, from somewhat they feele in their Bodies;)
  1585	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand some other Appetites, not many. The rest, which are Appetites of
  1586	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tparticular things, proceed from Experience, and triall of their effects
  1587	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tupon themselves, or other men. For of things wee know not at all, or
  1588	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbelieve not to be, we can have no further Desire, than to tast and try.
  1589	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut Aversion wee have for things, not onely which we know have hurt us;
  1590	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut also that we do not know whether they will hurt us, or not.

  1595	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tContempt
  1596	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1597	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThose things which we neither Desire, nor Hate, we are said to Contemne:
  1598	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCONTEMPT being nothing els but an immobility, or contumacy of the Heart,
  1599	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin resisting the action of certain things; and proceeding from that the
  1600	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHeart is already moved otherwise, by either more potent objects; or from
  1601	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twant of experience of them.
  1602	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1603	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd because the constitution of a mans Body, is in continuall mutation;
  1604	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit is impossible that all the same things should alwayes cause in him
  1605	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe same Appetites, and aversions: much lesse can all men consent, in
  1606	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Desire of almost any one and the same Object.

  1612	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1613	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut whatsoever is the object of any mans Appetite or Desire; that is
  1614	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit, which he for his part calleth Good: And the object of his Hate,
  1615	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Aversion, evill; And of his contempt, Vile, and Inconsiderable.
  1616	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor these words of Good, evill, and Contemptible, are ever used with
  1617	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trelation to the person that useth them: There being nothing simply and
  1618	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tabsolutely so; nor any common Rule of Good and evill, to be taken from
  1619	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe nature of the objects themselves; but from the Person of the man
  1620	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(where there is no Common-wealth;) or, (in a Common-wealth,) From the
  1621	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPerson that representeth it; or from an Arbitrator or Judge, whom men
  1622	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdisagreeing shall by consent set up, and make his sentence the Rule

  1628	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPulchrum Turpe; Delightfull Profitable; Unpleasant Unprofitable
  1629	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1630	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Latine Tongue has two words, whose significations approach to
  1631	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose of Good and Evill; but are not precisely the same; And those are
  1632	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPulchrum and Turpe. Whereof the former signifies that, which by some
  1633	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tapparent signes promiseth Good; and the later, that, which promiseth
  1634	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevill. But in our Tongue we have not so generall names to expresse them
  1635	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby. But for Pulchrum, we say in some things, Fayre; in other Beautifull,
  1636	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor Handsome, or Gallant, or Honourable, or Comely, or Amiable; and
  1637	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor Turpe, Foule, Deformed, Ugly, Base, Nauseous, and the like, as the
  1638	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsubject shall require; All which words, in their proper places signifie
  1639	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnothing els, but the Mine, or Countenance, that promiseth Good and
  1640	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevill. So that of Good there be three kinds; Good in the Promise,
  1641	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat is Pulchrum; Good in Effect, as the end desired, which is called
  1642	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJucundum, Delightfull; and Good as the Means, which is called Utile,
  1643	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tProfitable; and as many of evill: For evill, in Promise, is that
  1644	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey call Turpe; evill in Effect, and End, is Molestum, Unpleasant,
  1645	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTroublesome; and evill in the Means, Inutile, Unprofitable, Hurtfull.

  1650	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDelight Displeasure
  1651	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1652	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAs, in Sense, that which is really within us, is (As I have sayd
  1653	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbefore) onely Motion, caused by the action of externall objects, but in
  1654	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tapparence; to the Sight, Light and Colour; to the Eare, Sound; to the
  1655	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNostrill, Odour, &c: so, when the action of the same object is continued
  1656	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom the Eyes, Eares, and other organs to the Heart; the real effect
  1657	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere is nothing but Motion, or Endeavour; which consisteth in Appetite,
  1658	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor Aversion, to, or from the object moving. But the apparence, or sense
  1659	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof that motion, is that wee either call DELIGHT, or TROUBLE OF MIND.

  1666	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThis Motion, which is called Appetite, and for the apparence of it
  1667	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDelight, and Pleasure, seemeth to be, a corroboration of Vitall motion,
  1668	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand a help thereunto; and therefore such things as caused Delight, were
  1669	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot improperly called Jucunda, (A Juvando,) from helping or fortifying;
  1670	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand the contrary, Molesta, Offensive, from hindering, and troubling the
  1671	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmotion vitall.
  1672	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1673	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPleasure therefore, (or Delight,) is the apparence, or sense of Good;
  1674	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Molestation or Displeasure, the apparence, or sense of evill. And
  1675	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsequently all Appetite, Desire, and Love, is accompanied with some
  1676	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDelight more or lesse; and all Hatred, and Aversion, with more or lesse

  1683	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1684	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf Pleasures, or Delights, some arise from the sense of an object
  1685	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPresent; And those may be called Pleasures Of Sense, (The word Sensuall,
  1686	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas it is used by those onely that condemn them, having no place till
  1687	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere be Lawes.) Of this kind are all Onerations and Exonerations of the
  1688	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbody; as also all that is pleasant, in the Sight, Hearing, Smell,
  1689	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTast, Or Touch; Others arise from the Expectation, that proceeds from
  1690	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tforesight of the End, or Consequence of things; whether those things in
  1691	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Sense Please or Displease: And these are Pleasures Of The Mind of
  1692	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim that draweth those consequences; and are generally called JOY. In
  1693	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe like manner, Displeasures, are some in the Sense, and called PAYNE;

  1695	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1696	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThese simple Passions called Appetite, Desire, Love, Aversion, Hate,
  1697	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJoy, and griefe, have their names for divers considerations diversified.
  1698	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAs first, when they one succeed another, they are diversly called from
  1699	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe opinion men have of the likelihood of attaining what they
  1700	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdesire. Secondly, from the object loved or hated. Thirdly, from the
  1701	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsideration of many of them together. Fourthly, from the Alteration or

  1703	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1704	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t

  1707	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDespaire-- The same, without such opinion, DESPAIRE.
  1708	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t

  1762	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCuriosity-- Desire, to know why, and how, CURIOSITY; such as is in no
  1763	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tliving creature but Man; so that Man is distinguished, not onely by his
  1764	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tReason; but also by this singular Passion from other Animals; in whom
  1765	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe appetite of food, and other pleasures of Sense, by praedominance,
  1766	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttake away the care of knowing causes; which is a Lust of the mind,
  1767	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat by a perseverance of delight in the continuall and indefatigable
  1768	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgeneration of Knowledge, exceedeth the short vehemence of any carnall
  1769	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPleasure.
  1770	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1771	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tReligion Superstition; True Religion-- Feare of power invisible, feigned
  1772	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby the mind, or imagined from tales publiquely allowed, RELIGION; not
  1773	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tallowed, superstition. And when the power imagined is truly such as we
  1774	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\timagine, TRUE RELIGION.
  1775	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1776	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPanique Terrour-- Feare, without the apprehension of why, or what,
  1777	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPANIQUE TERROR; called so from the fables that make Pan the author of
  1778	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem; whereas in truth there is always in him that so feareth, first,
  1779	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsome apprehension of the cause, though the rest run away by example;
  1780	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevery one supposing his fellow to know why. And therefore this Passion
  1781	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thappens to none but in a throng, or multitude of people.
  1782	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1783	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAdmiration-- Joy, from apprehension of novelty, ADMIRATION; proper to
  1784	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman, because it excites the appetite of knowing the cause.
  1785	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1786	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGlory Vaine-glory-- Joy, arising from imagination of a man's own power
  1787	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand ability, is that exultation of the mind which is called GLORYING:
  1788	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich, if grounded upon the experience of his own former actions, is
  1789	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe same with Confidence: but if grounded on the flattery of others, or
  1790	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tonely supposed by himselfe, for delight in the consequences of it,
  1791	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis called VAINE-GLORY: which name is properly given; because a
  1792	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twell-grounded Confidence begetteth attempt; whereas the supposing of
  1793	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpower does not, and is therefore rightly called Vaine.
  1794	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1795	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDejection-- Griefe, from opinion of want of power, is called dejection
  1796	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof mind.
  1797	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1798	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Vaine-glory which consisteth in the feigning or supposing of
  1799	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tabilities in ourselves, which we know are not, is most incident to young
  1800	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen, and nourished by the Histories or Fictions of Gallant Persons; and
  1801	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis corrected often times by Age, and Employment.
  1802	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1803	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSudden Glory Laughter-- Sudden glory, is the passion which maketh those
  1804	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGrimaces called LAUGHTER; and is caused either by some sudden act of
  1805	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir own, that pleaseth them; or by the apprehension of some
  1806	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdeformed thing in another, by comparison whereof they suddenly applaud
  1807	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthemselves. And it is incident most to them, that are conscious of the
  1808	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfewest abilities in themselves; who are forced to keep themselves in
  1809	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir own favour, by observing the imperfections of other men.
  1810	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd therefore much Laughter at the defects of others is a signe of
  1811	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPusillanimity. For of great minds, one of the proper workes is, to help
  1812	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand free others from scorn; and compare themselves onely with the most
  1813	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\table.
  1814	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1815	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSudden Dejection Weeping-- On the contrary, Sudden Dejection is the
  1816	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpassion that causeth WEEPING; and is caused by such accidents, as
  1817	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuddenly take away some vehement hope, or some prop of their power: and
  1818	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey are most subject to it, that rely principally on helps externall,
  1819	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch as are Women, and Children. Therefore, some Weep for the loss of
  1820	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFriends; Others for their unkindnesse; others for the sudden stop made
  1821	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto their thoughts of revenge, by Reconciliation. But in all cases, both
  1822	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaughter and Weeping, are sudden motions; Custome taking them both away.
  1823	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor no man Laughs at old jests; or Weeps for an old calamity.
  1824	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1825	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tShame Blushing-- Griefe, for the discovery of some defect of ability
  1826	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis SHAME, or the passion that discovereth itself in BLUSHING; and
  1827	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsisteth in the apprehension of some thing dishonourable; and in young
  1828	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen, is a signe of the love of good reputation; and commendable: in
  1829	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\told men it is a signe of the same; but because it comes too late, not
  1830	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommendable.
  1831	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1832	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tImpudence-- The Contempt of good reputation is called IMPUDENCE.
  1833	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1834	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPitty-- Griefe, for the calamity of another is PITTY; and ariseth
  1835	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom the imagination that the like calamity may befall himselfe; and
  1836	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore is called also COMPASSION, and in the phrase of this present
  1837	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttime a FELLOW-FEELING: and therefore for Calamity arriving from
  1838	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgreat wickedness, the best men have the least Pitty; and for the same
  1839	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCalamity, those have least Pitty, that think themselves least obnoxious
  1840	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto the same.
  1841	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1842	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCruelty-- Contempt, or little sense of the calamity of others, is that
  1843	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich men call CRUELTY; proceeding from Security of their own fortune.
  1844	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor, that any man should take pleasure in other mens' great harmes,
  1845	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twithout other end of his own, I do not conceive it possible.

  1852	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDeliberation-- When in the mind of man, Appetites and Aversions, Hopes
  1853	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Feares, concerning one and the same thing, arise alternately; and
  1854	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdivers good and evill consequences of the doing, or omitting the thing
  1855	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpropounded, come successively into our thoughts; so that sometimes we
  1856	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave an Appetite to it, sometimes an Aversion from it; sometimes Hope to
  1857	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe able to do it; sometimes Despaire, or Feare to attempt it; the whole
  1858	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsum of Desires, Aversions, Hopes and Feares, continued till the thing be
  1859	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teither done, or thought impossible, is that we call DELIBERATION.
  1860	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1861	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTherefore of things past, there is no Deliberation; because manifestly
  1862	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\timpossible to be changed: nor of things known to be impossible, or
  1863	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthought so; because men know, or think such Deliberation vaine. But
  1864	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof things impossible, which we think possible, we may Deliberate; not
  1865	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tknowing it is in vain. And it is called DELIBERATION; because it is a
  1866	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tputting an end to the Liberty we had of doing, or omitting, according to
  1867	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tour own Appetite, or Aversion.
  1868	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1869	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThis alternate succession of Appetites, Aversions, Hopes and Feares is
  1870	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tno less in other living Creatures than in Man; and therefore Beasts also
  1871	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDeliberate.
  1872	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1873	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEvery Deliberation is then sayd to End when that whereof they
  1874	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDeliberate, is either done, or thought impossible; because till then wee
  1875	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tretain the liberty of doing, or omitting, according to our Appetite, or
  1876	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAversion.

  1881	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Will
  1882	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1883	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn Deliberation, the last Appetite, or Aversion, immediately adhaering
  1884	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto the action, or to the omission thereof, is that wee call the
  1885	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWILL; the Act, (not the faculty,) of Willing. And Beasts that have
  1886	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDeliberation must necessarily also have Will. The Definition of the
  1887	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWill, given commonly by the Schooles, that it is a Rationall Appetite,
  1888	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis not good. For if it were, then could there be no Voluntary Act
  1889	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagainst Reason. For a Voluntary Act is that, which proceedeth from the
  1890	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWill, and no other. But if in stead of a Rationall Appetite, we shall
  1891	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsay an Appetite resulting from a precedent Deliberation, then the
  1892	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDefinition is the same that I have given here. Will, therefore, Is The
  1893	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLast Appetite In Deliberating. And though we say in common Discourse, a
  1894	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman had a Will once to do a thing, that neverthelesse he forbore to
  1895	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdo; yet that is properly but an Inclination, which makes no Action
  1896	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tVoluntary; because the action depends not of it, but of the last
  1897	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInclination, or Appetite. For if the intervenient Appetites make any
  1898	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\taction Voluntary, then by the same reason all intervenient Aversions
  1899	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshould make the same action Involuntary; and so one and the same action
  1900	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshould be both Voluntary & Involuntary.
  1901	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1902	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBy this it is manifest, that not onely actions that have their beginning
  1903	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom Covetousness, Ambition, Lust, or other Appetites to the thing
  1904	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpropounded; but also those that have their beginning from Aversion,
  1905	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor Feare of those consequences that follow the omission, are Voluntary
  1906	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tActions.

  1911	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFormes Of Speech, In Passion
  1912	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1913	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe formes of Speech by which the Passions are expressed, are partly the
  1914	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsame, and partly different from those, by which we express our Thoughts.
  1915	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd first generally all Passions may be expressed Indicatively; as, I
  1916	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLove, I Feare, I Joy, I Deliberate, I Will, I Command: but some of them
  1917	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave particular expressions by themselves, which nevertheless are not
  1918	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\taffirmations, unless it be when they serve to make other inferences,
  1919	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbesides that of the Passion they proceed from. Deliberation is expressed
  1920	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSubjunctively; which is a speech proper to signifie suppositions, with
  1921	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir consequences; as, If This Be Done, Then This Will Follow; and
  1922	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdiffers not from the language of Reasoning, save that Reasoning is in
  1923	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgenerall words, but Deliberation for the most part is of Particulars.
  1924	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe language of Desire, and Aversion, is Imperative; as, Do This,
  1925	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tForbear That; which when the party is obliged to do, or forbear, is
  1926	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommand; otherwise Prayer; or els Counsell. The language of Vaine-Glory,
  1927	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Indignation, Pitty and Revengefulness, Optative: but of the Desire to
  1928	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tknow, there is a peculiar expression called Interrogative; as, What Is
  1929	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIt, When Shall It, How Is It Done, and Why So? Other language of the
  1930	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPassions I find none: for Cursing, Swearing, Reviling, and the like, do
  1931	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot signifie as Speech; but as the actions of a tongue accustomed.
  1932	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1933	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThese forms of Speech, I say, are expressions, or voluntary
  1934	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsignifications of our Passions: but certain signes they be not; because
  1935	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey may be used arbitrarily, whether they that use them, have such
  1936	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPassions or not. The best signes of Passions present, are either in the
  1937	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcountenance, motions of the body, actions, and ends, or aims, which we
  1938	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\totherwise know the man to have.

  1943	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGood And Evill Apparent
  1944	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1945	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd because in Deliberation the Appetites and Aversions are raised by
  1946	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tforesight of the good and evill consequences, and sequels of the action
  1947	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhereof we Deliberate; the good or evill effect thereof dependeth on the
  1948	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tforesight of a long chain of consequences, of which very seldome any man
  1949	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis able to see to the end. But for so far as a man seeth, if the Good
  1950	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin those consequences be greater than the evill, the whole chain is that
  1951	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich Writers call Apparent or Seeming Good. And contrarily, when the
  1952	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevill exceedeth the good, the whole is Apparent or Seeming Evill: so
  1953	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat he who hath by Experience, or Reason, the greatest and surest
  1954	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprospect of Consequences, Deliberates best himself; and is able, when he
  1955	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twill, to give the best counsel unto others.

  1965	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas perpetual Tranquillity of mind, while we live here; because Life
  1966	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\titself is but Motion, and can never be without Desire, nor without
  1967	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFeare, no more than without Sense. What kind of Felicity God hath
  1968	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tordained to them that devoutly honour him, a man shall no sooner know,
  1969	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthan enjoy; being joys, that now are as incomprehensible, as the word of

  1980	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe opinion they have of a man's felicity is by the Greeks called
  1981	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMakarismos, for which we have no name in our tongue. And thus much is

  1986	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCHAPTER VII. OF THE ENDS OR RESOLUTIONS OF DISCOURSE
  1987	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1988	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1989	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf all Discourse, governed by desire of Knowledge, there is at last
  1990	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tan End, either by attaining, or by giving over. And in the chain of
  1991	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDiscourse, wheresoever it be interrupted, there is an End for that time.
  1992	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1993	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1994	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1995	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1996	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJudgement, or Sentence Final; Doubt
  1997	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  1998	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIf the Discourse be meerly Mentall, it consisteth of thoughts that the
  1999	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthing will be, and will not be; or that it has been, and has not been,
  2000	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talternately. So that wheresoever you break off the chayn of a mans
  2001	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDiscourse, you leave him in a Praesumption of It Will Be, or, It Will
  2002	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNot Be; or it Has Been, or, Has Not Been. All which is Opinion. And that
  2003	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich is alternate Appetite, in Deliberating concerning Good and Evil,
  2004	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe same is alternate Opinion in the Enquiry of the truth of Past, and
  2005	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFuture. And as the last Appetite in Deliberation is called the Will, so
  2006	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe last Opinion in search of the truth of Past, and Future, is called
  2007	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe JUDGEMENT, or Resolute and Final Sentence of him that Discourseth.
  2008	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd as the whole chain of Appetites alternate, in the question of Good
  2009	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor Bad is called Deliberation; so the whole chain of Opinions alternate,
  2010	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the question of True, or False is called DOUBT.
  2011	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2012	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNo Discourse whatsoever, can End in absolute knowledge of Fact, past, or
  2013	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto come. For, as for the knowledge of Fact, it is originally, Sense; and
  2014	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tever after, Memory. And for the knowledge of consequence, which I have
  2015	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsaid before is called Science, it is not Absolute, but Conditionall. No
  2016	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman can know by Discourse, that this, or that, is, has been, or will
  2017	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe; which is to know absolutely: but onely, that if This be, That is; if
  2018	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThis has been, That has been; if This shall be, That shall be: which
  2019	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis to know conditionally; and that not the consequence of one thing to
  2020	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tanother; but of one name of a thing, to another name of the same thing.
  2021	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t

  2025	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tScience Opinion Conscience
  2026	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2027	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd therefore, when the Discourse is put into Speech, and begins with
  2028	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Definitions of Words, and proceeds by Connexion of the same into
  2029	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgeneral Affirmations, and of these again into Syllogismes, the end or
  2030	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlast sum is called the Conclusion; and the thought of the mind by it
  2031	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsignified is that conditional Knowledge, or Knowledge of the consequence
  2032	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof words, which is commonly called Science. But if the first ground of
  2033	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch Discourse be not Definitions, or if the Definitions be not rightly
  2034	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tjoyned together into Syllogismes, then the End or Conclusion is again
  2035	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOPINION, namely of the truth of somewhat said, though sometimes in
  2036	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tabsurd and senslesse words, without possibility of being understood.
  2037	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhen two, or more men, know of one and the same fact, they are said
  2038	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto be CONSCIOUS of it one to another; which is as much as to know it
  2039	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttogether. And because such are fittest witnesses of the facts of one
  2040	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tanother, or of a third, it was, and ever will be reputed a very Evill
  2041	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tact, for any man to speak against his Conscience; or to corrupt or force
  2042	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tanother so to do: Insomuch that the plea of Conscience, has been always
  2043	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thearkened unto very diligently in all times. Afterwards, men made use
  2044	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the same word metaphorically, for the knowledge of their own secret
  2045	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfacts, and secret thoughts; and therefore it is Rhetorically said that
  2046	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Conscience is a thousand witnesses. And last of all, men, vehemently
  2047	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin love with their own new opinions, (though never so absurd,) and
  2048	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobstinately bent to maintain them, gave those their opinions also that
  2049	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treverenced name of Conscience, as if they would have it seem unlawful,
  2050	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto change or speak against them; and so pretend to know they are true,
  2051	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhen they know at most but that they think so.

  2055	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2056	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBeliefe Faith
  2057	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2058	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhen a mans Discourse beginneth not at Definitions, it beginneth either
  2059	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tat some other contemplation of his own, and then it is still called
  2060	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOpinion; Or it beginneth at some saying of another, of whose ability to
  2061	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tknow the truth, and of whose honesty in not deceiving, he doubteth
  2062	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot; and then the Discourse is not so much concerning the Thing, as the
  2063	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPerson; And the Resolution is called BELEEFE, and FAITH: Faith, In the
  2064	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman; Beleefe, both Of the man, and Of the truth of what he sayes. So
  2065	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthen in Beleefe are two opinions; one of the saying of the man; the
  2066	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother of his vertue. To Have Faith In, or Trust To, or Beleeve A Man,
  2067	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsignifie the same thing; namely, an opinion of the veracity of the man:
  2068	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut to Beleeve What Is Said, signifieth onely an opinion of the truth
  2069	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the saying. But wee are to observe that this Phrase, I Beleeve In;
  2070	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas also the Latine, Credo In; and the Greek, Pisteno Eis, are never used
  2071	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut in the writings of Divines. In stead of them, in other writings are
  2072	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tput, I Beleeve Him; I Have Faith In Him; I Rely On Him: and in Latin,
  2073	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCredo Illi; Fido Illi: and in Greek, Pisteno Anto: and that this
  2074	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsingularity of the Ecclesiastical use of the word hath raised many
  2075	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdisputes about the right object of the Christian Faith.
  2076	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2077	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut by Beleeving In, as it is in the Creed, is meant, not trust in the
  2078	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPerson; but Confession and acknowledgement of the Doctrine. For not
  2079	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tonely Christians, but all manner of men do so believe in God, as to hold
  2080	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall for truth they heare him say, whether they understand it, or not;
  2081	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich is all the Faith and trust can possibly be had in any person
  2082	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhatsoever: But they do not all believe the Doctrine of the Creed.
  2083	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2084	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFrom whence we may inferre, that when wee believe any saying whatsoever
  2085	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit be, to be true, from arguments taken, not from the thing it selfe, or
  2086	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom the principles of naturall Reason, but from the Authority, and
  2087	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgood opinion wee have, of him that hath sayd it; then is the speaker, or
  2088	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tperson we believe in, or trust in, and whose word we take, the object of
  2089	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tour Faith; and the Honour done in Believing, is done to him onely. And
  2090	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsequently, when wee Believe that the Scriptures are the word of God,
  2091	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thaving no immediate revelation from God himselfe, our Beleefe, Faith,
  2092	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Trust is in the Church; whose word we take, and acquiesce therein.
  2093	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd they that believe that which a Prophet relates unto them in the
  2094	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tname of God, take the word of the Prophet, do honour to him, and in him
  2095	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttrust, and believe, touching the truth of what he relateth, whether he
  2096	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe a true, or a false Prophet. And so it is also with all other History.
  2097	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor if I should not believe all that is written By Historians, of the
  2098	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tglorious acts of Alexander, or Caesar; I do not think the Ghost of
  2099	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAlexander, or Caesar, had any just cause to be offended; or any body
  2100	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\telse, but the Historian. If Livy say the Gods made once a Cow speak, and
  2101	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twe believe it not; wee distrust not God therein, but Livy. So that it is
  2102	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevident, that whatsoever we believe, upon no other reason, than what is

  2110	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAND THEIR CONTRARY DEFECTS

  2115	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIntellectuall Vertue Defined
  2116	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2117	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tVertue generally, in all sorts of subjects, is somewhat that is valued
  2118	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor eminence; and consisteth in comparison. For if all things
  2119	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere equally in all men, nothing would be prized. And by Vertues
  2120	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tINTELLECTUALL, are always understood such abilityes of the mind, as men
  2121	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpraise, value, and desire should be in themselves; and go commonly under
  2122	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe name of a Good Witte; though the same word Witte, be used also, to
  2123	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdistinguish one certain ability from the rest.
  2124	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2125	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2126	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2127	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2128	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWit, Naturall, Or Acquired
  2129	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2130	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThese Vertues are of two sorts; Naturall, and Acquired. By Naturall, I
  2131	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmean not, that which a man hath from his Birth: for that is nothing else
  2132	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut Sense; wherein men differ so little one from another, and from brute
  2133	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBeasts, as it is not to be reckoned amongst Vertues. But I mean, that
  2134	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWitte, which is gotten by Use onely, and Experience; without Method,
  2135	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCulture, or Instruction. This NATURALL WITTE, consisteth principally
  2136	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin two things; Celerity Of Imagining, (that is, swift succession of one
  2137	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthought to another;) and Steddy Direction to some approved end. On the
  2138	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tContrary a slow Imagination, maketh that Defect, or fault of the mind,
  2139	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich is commonly called DULNESSE, Stupidity, and sometimes by other
  2140	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnames that signifie slownesse of motion, or difficulty to be moved.
  2141	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2142	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2143	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2144	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2145	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGood Wit, Or Fancy; Good Judgement; Discretion
  2146	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2147	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd this difference of quicknesse, is caused by the difference of mens
  2148	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpassions; that love and dislike, some one thing, some another: and
  2149	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore some mens thoughts run one way, some another: and are held to,
  2150	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand observe differently the things that passe through their imagination.
  2151	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd whereas in his succession of mens thoughts, there is nothing to
  2152	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobserve in the things they think on, but either in what they be Like One
  2153	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnother, or in what they be Unlike, or What They Serve For, or How They
  2154	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tServe To Such A Purpose; Those that observe their similitudes, in case
  2155	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey be such as are but rarely observed by others, are sayd to have a
  2156	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGood Wit; by which, in this occasion, is meant a Good Fancy. But they
  2157	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat observe their differences, and dissimilitudes; which is called
  2158	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDistinguishing, and Discerning, and Judging between thing and thing; in
  2159	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcase, such discerning be not easie, are said to have a Good Judgement:
  2160	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand particularly in matter of conversation and businesse; wherein,
  2161	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttimes, places, and persons are to be discerned, this Vertue is called
  2162	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDISCRETION. The former, that is, Fancy, without the help of Judgement,
  2163	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis not commended as a Vertue: but the later which is Judgement, and
  2164	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDiscretion, is commended for it selfe, without the help of Fancy.
  2165	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBesides the Discretion of times, places, and persons, necessary to a
  2166	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgood Fancy, there is required also an often application of his thoughts
  2167	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto their End; that is to say, to some use to be made of them. This done;
  2168	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the that hath this Vertue, will be easily fitted with similitudes, that
  2169	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twill please, not onely by illustration of his discourse, and adorning it
  2170	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith new and apt metaphors; but also, by the rarity or their invention.
  2171	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut without Steddinesse, and Direction to some End, a great Fancy is one
  2172	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tkind of Madnesse; such as they have, that entring into any discourse,
  2173	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare snatched from their purpose, by every thing that comes in their
  2174	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthought, into so many, and so long digressions, and parentheses, that
  2175	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey utterly lose themselves: Which kind of folly, I know no particular
  2176	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tname for: but the cause of it is, sometimes want of experience; whereby
  2177	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat seemeth to a man new and rare, which doth not so to others:
  2178	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsometimes Pusillanimity; by which that seems great to him, which other
  2179	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen think a trifle: and whatsoever is new, or great, and therefore
  2180	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthought fit to be told, withdrawes a man by degrees from the intended
  2181	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tway of his discourse.
  2182	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2183	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn a good Poem, whether it be Epique, or Dramatique; as also in Sonnets,
  2184	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEpigrams, and other Pieces, both Judgement and Fancy are required:
  2185	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut the Fancy must be more eminent; because they please for the
  2186	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tExtravagancy; but ought not to displease by Indiscretion.
  2187	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2188	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn a good History, the Judgement must be eminent; because the goodnesse
  2189	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsisteth, in the Method, in the Truth, and in the Choyse of the
  2190	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tactions that are most profitable to be known. Fancy has no place, but
  2191	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tonely in adorning the stile.
  2192	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2193	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn Orations of Prayse, and in Invectives, the Fancy is praedominant;
  2194	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbecause the designe is not truth, but to Honour or Dishonour; which is
  2195	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdone by noble, or by vile comparisons. The Judgement does but suggest
  2196	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhat circumstances make an action laudable, or culpable.
  2197	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2198	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn Hortatives, and Pleadings, as Truth, or Disguise serveth best to the
  2199	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDesigne in hand; so is the Judgement, or the Fancy most required.
  2200	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2201	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn Demonstration, in Councell, and all rigourous search of Truth,
  2202	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJudgement does all; except sometimes the understanding have need to be
  2203	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\topened by some apt similitude; and then there is so much use of Fancy.
  2204	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut for Metaphors, they are in this case utterly excluded. For seeing
  2205	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey openly professe deceipt; to admit them into Councell, or Reasoning,
  2206	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere manifest folly.
  2207	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2208	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd in any Discourse whatsoever, if the defect of Discretion be
  2209	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tapparent, how extravagant soever the Fancy be, the whole discourse
  2210	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twill be taken for a signe of want of wit; and so will it never when the
  2211	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDiscretion is manifest, though the Fancy be never so ordinary.
  2212	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2213	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe secret thoughts of a man run over all things, holy, prophane,
  2214	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tclean, obscene, grave, and light, without shame, or blame; which verball
  2215	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdiscourse cannot do, farther than the Judgement shall approve of the
  2216	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTime, Place, and Persons. An Anatomist, or a Physitian may speak, or
  2217	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twrite his judgement of unclean things; because it is not to please,
  2218	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut profit: but for another man to write his extravagant, and pleasant
  2219	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfancies of the same, is as if a man, from being tumbled into the dirt,
  2220	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshould come and present himselfe before good company. And 'tis the want
  2221	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Discretion that makes the difference. Again, in profest remissnesse
  2222	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof mind, and familiar company, a man may play with the sounds, and
  2223	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\taequivocal significations of words; and that many times with encounters
  2224	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof extraordinary Fancy: but in a Sermon, or in publique, or before
  2225	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpersons unknown, or whom we ought to reverence, there is no Gingling of
  2226	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twords that will not be accounted folly: and the difference is onely in
  2227	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe want of Discretion. So that where Wit is wanting, it is not Fancy
  2228	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat is wanting, but Discretion. Judgement therefore without Fancy is
  2229	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWit, but Fancy without Judgement not.

  2232	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2233	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2234	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPrudence
  2235	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2236	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhen the thoughts of a man, that has a designe in hand, running over a
  2237	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmultitude of things, observes how they conduce to that designe; or what
  2238	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdesigne they may conduce into; if his observations be such as are not
  2239	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teasie, or usuall, This wit of his is called PRUDENCE; and dependeth on
  2240	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmuch Experience, and Memory of the like things, and their consequences
  2241	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\theretofore. In which there is not so much difference of Men, as there is
  2242	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin their Fancies and Judgements; Because the Experience of men equall
  2243	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin age, is not much unequall, as to the quantity; but lyes in different
  2244	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\toccasions; every one having his private designes. To govern well a
  2245	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfamily, and a kingdome, are not different degrees of Prudence; but
  2246	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdifferent sorts of businesse; no more then to draw a picture in little,
  2247	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor as great, or greater then the life, are different degrees of Art. A
  2248	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tplain husband-man is more Prudent in affaires of his own house, then a
  2249	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPrivy Counseller in the affaires of another man.
  2250	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t

  2254	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCraft
  2255	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2256	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo Prudence, if you adde the use of unjust, or dishonest means, such
  2257	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas usually are prompted to men by Feare, or Want; you have that Crooked
  2258	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWisdome, which is called CRAFT; which is a signe of Pusillanimity. For
  2259	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMagnanimity is contempt of unjust, or dishonest helps. And that which
  2260	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Latines Call Versutia, (translated into English, Shifting,) and is
  2261	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta putting off of a present danger or incommodity, by engaging into
  2262	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta greater, as when a man robbs one to pay another, is but a shorter
  2263	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsighted Craft, called Versutia, from Versura, which signifies taking
  2264	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmony at usurie, for the present payment of interest.
  2265	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2266	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2267	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2268	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2269	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAcquired Wit
  2270	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2271	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAs for Acquired Wit, (I mean acquired by method and instruction,) there
  2272	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis none but Reason; which is grounded on the right use of Speech; and
  2273	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tproduceth the Sciences. But of Reason and Science, I have already spoken
  2274	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the fifth and sixth Chapters.
  2275	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2276	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe causes of this difference of Witts, are in the Passions: and
  2277	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe difference of Passions, proceedeth partly from the different
  2278	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConstitution of the body, and partly from different Education. For if
  2279	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe difference proceeded from the temper of the brain, and the organs of
  2280	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSense, either exterior or interior, there would be no lesse difference
  2281	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof men in their Sight, Hearing, or other Senses, than in their Fancies,
  2282	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Discretions. It proceeds therefore from the Passions; which are
  2283	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdifferent, not onely from the difference of mens complexions; but also
  2284	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom their difference of customes, and education.
  2285	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2286	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Passions that most of all cause the differences of Wit, are
  2287	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprincipally, the more or lesse Desire of Power, of Riches, of Knowledge,
  2288	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand of Honour. All which may be reduced to the first, that is Desire of
  2289	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPower. For Riches, Knowledge and Honour are but severall sorts of Power.
  2290	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2291	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2292	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2293	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2294	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGiddinesse Madnesse
  2295	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2296	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd therefore, a man who has no great Passion for any of these things;
  2297	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut is as men terme it indifferent; though he may be so farre a good
  2298	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman, as to be free from giving offence; yet he cannot possibly have
  2299	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teither a great Fancy, or much Judgement. For the Thoughts, are to the
  2300	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDesires, as Scouts, and Spies, to range abroad, and find the way to the
  2301	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthings Desired: All Stedinesse of the minds motion, and all quicknesse
  2302	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the same, proceeding from thence. For as to have no Desire, is to
  2303	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe Dead: so to have weak Passions, is Dulnesse; and to have Passions
  2304	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tindifferently for every thing, GIDDINESSE, and Distraction; and to have
  2305	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tstronger, and more vehement Passions for any thing, than is ordinarily
  2306	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tseen in others, is that which men call MADNESSE.
  2307	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2308	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhereof there be almost as many kinds, as of the Passions themselves.
  2309	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSometimes the extraordinary and extravagant Passion, proceedeth from the
  2310	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevill constitution of the organs of the Body, or harme done them; and
  2311	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsometimes the hurt, and indisposition of the Organs, is caused by the
  2312	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tvehemence, or long continuance of the Passion. But in both cases the
  2313	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMadnesse is of one and the same nature.
  2314	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2315	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Passion, whose violence, or continuance maketh Madnesse, is either
  2316	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgreat Vaine-Glory; which is commonly called Pride, and Selfe-Conceipt;
  2317	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor great Dejection of mind.
  2318	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2319	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2320	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2321	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2322	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRage
  2323	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2324	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPride, subjecteth a man to Anger, the excesse whereof, is the Madnesse
  2325	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcalled RAGE, and FURY. And thus it comes to passe that excessive desire
  2326	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Revenge, when it becomes habituall, hurteth the organs, and becomes
  2327	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRage: That excessive love, with jealousie, becomes also Rage: Excessive
  2328	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\topinion of a mans own selfe, for divine inspiration, for wisdome,
  2329	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlearning, forme, and the like, becomes Distraction, and Giddinesse:
  2330	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe same, joyned with Envy, Rage: Vehement opinion of the truth of any
  2331	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthing, contradicted by others, Rage.
  2332	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2333	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2334	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2335	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2336	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMelancholy
  2337	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2338	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDejection, subjects a man to causelesse fears; which is a Madnesse
  2339	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommonly called MELANCHOLY, apparent also in divers manners; as in
  2340	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thaunting of solitudes, and graves; in superstitious behaviour; and in
  2341	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfearing some one, some another particular thing. In summe, all Passions
  2342	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat produce strange and unusuall behaviour, are called by the generall
  2343	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tname of Madnesse. But of the severall kinds of Madnesse, he that
  2344	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twould take the paines, might enrowle a legion. And if the Excesses be
  2345	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmadnesse, there is no doubt but the Passions themselves, when they tend
  2346	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto Evill, are degrees of the same.
  2347	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2348	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(For example,) Though the effect of folly, in them that are possessed of
  2349	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tan opinion of being inspired, be not visible alwayes in one man, by any
  2350	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tvery extravagant action, that proceedeth from such Passion; yet when
  2351	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmany of them conspire together, the Rage of the whole multitude is
  2352	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tvisible enough. For what argument of Madnesse can there be greater, than
  2353	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto clamour, strike, and throw stones at our best friends? Yet this is
  2354	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsomewhat lesse than such a multitude will do. For they will clamour,
  2355	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfight against, and destroy those, by whom all their lifetime before,
  2356	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey have been protected, and secured from injury. And if this be
  2357	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMadnesse in the multitude, it is the same in every particular man. For
  2358	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas in the middest of the sea, though a man perceive no sound of
  2359	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat part of the water next him; yet he is well assured, that part
  2360	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontributes as much, to the Roaring of the Sea, as any other part, of
  2361	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe same quantity: so also, thought wee perceive no great unquietnesse,
  2362	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin one, or two men; yet we may be well assured, that their singular
  2363	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPassions, are parts of the Seditious roaring of a troubled Nation. And
  2364	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tif there were nothing else that bewrayed their madnesse; yet that very
  2365	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tarrogating such inspiration to themselves, is argument enough. If some
  2366	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman in Bedlam should entertaine you with sober discourse; and you desire
  2367	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin taking leave, to know what he were, that you might another time
  2368	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trequite his civility; and he should tell you, he were God the Father;
  2369	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tI think you need expect no extravagant action for argument of his
  2370	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMadnesse.
  2371	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2372	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThis opinion of Inspiration, called commonly, Private Spirit, begins
  2373	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tvery often, from some lucky finding of an Errour generally held by
  2374	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tothers; and not knowing, or not remembring, by what conduct of reason,
  2375	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey came to so singular a truth, (as they think it, though it be many
  2376	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttimes an untruth they light on,) they presently admire themselves; as
  2377	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeing in the speciall grace of God Almighty, who hath revealed the same
  2378	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto them supernaturally, by his Spirit.
  2379	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2380	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAgain, that Madnesse is nothing else, but too much appearing Passion,
  2381	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmay be gathered out of the effects of Wine, which are the same with
  2382	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose of the evill disposition of the organs. For the variety of
  2383	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbehaviour in men that have drunk too much, is the same with that of
  2384	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMad-men: some of them Raging, others Loving, others laughing, all
  2385	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\textravagantly, but according to their severall domineering Passions:
  2386	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor the effect of the wine, does but remove Dissimulation; and take from
  2387	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem the sight of the deformity of their Passions. For, (I believe) the
  2388	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmost sober men, when they walk alone without care and employment of the
  2389	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmind, would be unwilling the vanity and Extravagance of their thoughts
  2390	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tat that time should be publiquely seen: which is a confession, that
  2391	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPassions unguided, are for the most part meere Madnesse.
  2392	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2393	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe opinions of the world, both in antient and later ages, concerning
  2394	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe cause of madnesse, have been two. Some, deriving them from the
  2395	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPassions; some, from Daemons, or Spirits, either good, or bad, which
  2396	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey thought might enter into a man, possesse him, and move his organs
  2397	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis such strange, and uncouth manner, as mad-men use to do. The former
  2398	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsort therefore, called such men, Mad-men: but the Later, called them
  2399	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsometimes Daemoniacks, (that is, possessed with spirits;) sometimes
  2400	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEnergumeni, (that is agitated, or moved with spirits;) and now in
  2401	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tItaly they are called not onely Pazzi, Mad-men; but also Spiritati, men
  2402	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpossest.
  2403	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2404	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThere was once a great conflux of people in Abdera, a City of the
  2405	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGreeks, at the acting of the Tragedy of Andromeda, upon an extream hot
  2406	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tday: whereupon, a great many of the spectators falling into Fevers, had
  2407	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis accident from the heat, and from The Tragedy together, that they
  2408	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdid nothing but pronounce Iambiques, with the names of Perseus and
  2409	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAndromeda; which together with the Fever, was cured, by the comming on
  2410	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Winter: And this madnesse was thought to proceed from the Passion
  2411	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\timprinted by the Tragedy. Likewise there raigned a fit of madnesse in
  2412	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tanother Graecian city, which seized onely the young Maidens; and caused
  2413	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmany of them to hang themselves. This was by most then thought an act of
  2414	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Divel. But one that suspected, that contempt of life in them,
  2415	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmight proceed from some Passion of the mind, and supposing they did not
  2416	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontemne also their honour, gave counsell to the Magistrates, to strip
  2417	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch as so hang'd themselves, and let them hang out naked. This the
  2418	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tstory sayes cured that madnesse. But on the other side, the same
  2419	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGraecians, did often ascribe madnesse, to the operation of the
  2420	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEumenides, or Furyes; and sometimes of Ceres, Phoebus, and other Gods:
  2421	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tso much did men attribute to Phantasmes, as to think them aereal living
  2422	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbodies; and generally to call them Spirits. And as the Romans in this,
  2423	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\theld the same opinion with the Greeks: so also did the Jewes; For they
  2424	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcalle mad-men Prophets, or (according as they thought the spirits
  2425	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgood or bad) Daemoniacks; and some of them called both Prophets, and
  2426	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDaemoniacks, mad-men; and some called the same man both Daemoniack, and
  2427	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmad-man. But for the Gentiles, 'tis no wonder; because Diseases, and
  2428	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHealth; Vices, and Vertues; and many naturall accidents, were with them
  2429	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttermed, and worshipped as Daemons. So that a man was to understand by
  2430	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDaemon, as well (sometimes) an Ague, as a Divell. But for the Jewes to
  2431	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave such opinion, is somewhat strange. For neither Moses, nor Abraham
  2432	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpretended to Prophecy by possession of a Spirit; but from the voyce of
  2433	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod; or by a Vision or Dream: Nor is there any thing in his Law,
  2434	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMorall, or Ceremoniall, by which they were taught, there was any such
  2435	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEnthusiasme; or any Possession. When God is sayd, (Numb. 11. 25.) to
  2436	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttake from the Spirit that was in Moses, and give it to the 70. Elders,
  2437	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Spirit of God (taking it for the substance of God) is not divided.
  2438	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Scriptures by the Spirit of God in man, mean a mans spirit, enclined
  2439	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto Godlinesse. And where it is said (Exod. 28. 3.) "Whom I have filled
  2440	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith the Spirit of wisdome to make garments for Aaron," is not meant a
  2441	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tspirit put into them, that can make garments; but the wisdome of their
  2442	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\town spirits in that kind of work. In the like sense, the spirit of
  2443	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman, when it produceth unclean actions, is ordinarily called an unclean
  2444	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tspirit; and so other spirits, though not alwayes, yet as often as the
  2445	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tvertue or vice so stiled, is extraordinary, and Eminent. Neither did the
  2446	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother Prophets of the old Testament pretend Enthusiasme; or, that God
  2447	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tspake in them; but to them by Voyce, Vision, or Dream; and the Burthen
  2448	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf The Lord was not Possession, but Command. How then could the Jewes
  2449	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfall into this opinion of possession? I can imagine no reason, but that
  2450	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich is common to all men; namely, the want of curiosity to search
  2451	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnaturall causes; and their placing Felicity, in the acquisition of the
  2452	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgrosse pleasures of the Senses, and the things that most immediately
  2453	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconduce thereto. For they that see any strange, and unusuall ability, or
  2454	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdefect in a mans mind; unlesse they see withall, from what cause it may
  2455	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprobably proceed, can hardly think it naturall; and if not naturall,
  2456	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey must needs thinke it supernaturall; and then what can it be, but
  2457	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat either God, or the Divell is in him? And hence it came to passe,
  2458	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhen our Saviour (Mark 3.21.) was compassed about with the multitude,
  2459	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose of the house doubted he was mad, and went out to hold him: but
  2460	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Scribes said he had Belzebub, and that was it, by which he cast out
  2461	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdivels; as if the greater mad-man had awed the lesser. And that (John
  2462	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t10. 20.) some said, "He hath a Divell, and is mad;" whereas others
  2463	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tholding him for a Prophet, sayd, "These are not the words of one that
  2464	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thath a Divell." So in the old Testament he that came to anoynt Jehu, (2
  2465	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKings 9.11.) was a Prophet; but some of the company asked Jehu, "What
  2466	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcame that mad-man for?" So that in summe, it is manifest, that whosoever
  2467	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbehaved himselfe in extraordinary manner, was thought by the Jewes to be
  2468	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpossessed either with a good, or evill spirit; except by the Sadduces,
  2469	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twho erred so farre on the other hand, as not to believe there were at
  2470	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall any spirits, (which is very neere to direct Atheisme;) and thereby
  2471	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tperhaps the more provoked others, to terme such men Daemoniacks, rather
  2472	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthan mad-men.
  2473	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2474	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut why then does our Saviour proceed in the curing of them, as if they
  2475	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere possest; and not as if they were mad. To which I can give no other
  2476	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tkind of answer, but that which is given to those that urge the Scripture
  2477	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin like manner against the opinion of the motion of the Earth. The
  2478	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tScripture was written to shew unto men the kingdome of God; and to
  2479	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprepare their mindes to become his obedient subjects; leaving the
  2480	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tworld, and the Philosophy thereof, to the disputation of men, for the
  2481	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texercising of their naturall Reason. Whether the Earths, or Suns motion
  2482	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmake the day, and night; or whether the Exorbitant actions of men,
  2483	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tproceed from Passion, or from the Divell, (so we worship him not) it is
  2484	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall one, as to our obedience, and subjection to God Almighty; which is
  2485	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe thing for which the Scripture was written. As for that our Saviour
  2486	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tspeaketh to the disease, as to a person; it is the usuall phrase of all
  2487	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat cure by words onely, as Christ did, (and Inchanters pretend to
  2488	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdo, whether they speak to a Divel or not.) For is not Christ also said
  2489	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(Math. 8.26.) to have rebuked the winds? Is not he said also (Luk. 4.
  2490	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t39.) to rebuke a Fever? Yet this does not argue that a Fever is a Divel.
  2491	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd whereas many of these Divels are said to confesse Christ; it is not
  2492	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnecessary to interpret those places otherwise, than that those mad-men
  2493	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconfessed him. And whereas our Saviour (Math. 12. 43.) speaketh of an
  2494	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunclean Spirit, that having gone out of a man, wandreth through dry
  2495	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tplaces, seeking rest, and finding none; and returning into the same
  2496	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman, with seven other spirits worse than himselfe; It is manifestly a
  2497	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tParable, alluding to a man, that after a little endeavour to quit his
  2498	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlusts, is vanquished by the strength of them; and becomes seven times
  2499	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tworse than he was. So that I see nothing at all in the Scripture, that
  2500	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trequireth a beliefe, that Daemoniacks were any other thing but Mad-men.
  2501	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2502	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2503	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2504	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2505	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInsignificant Speech
  2506	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2507	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThere is yet another fault in the Discourses of some men; which may also
  2508	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe numbred amongst the sorts of Madnesse; namely, that abuse of words,
  2509	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhereof I have spoken before in the fifth chapter, by the Name of
  2510	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAbsurdity. And that is, when men speak such words, as put together, have
  2511	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin them no signification at all; but are fallen upon by some, through
  2512	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmisunderstanding of the words they have received, and repeat by rote; by
  2513	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tothers, from intention to deceive by obscurity. And this is incident to
  2514	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnone but those, that converse in questions of matters incomprehensible,
  2515	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas the Schoole-men; or in questions of abstruse Philosophy. The common
  2516	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsort of men seldome speak Insignificantly, and are therefore, by those
  2517	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother Egregious persons counted Idiots. But to be assured their words
  2518	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare without any thing correspondent to them in the mind, there would
  2519	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tneed some Examples; which if any man require, let him take a Schoole-man
  2520	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinto his hands, and see if he can translate any one chapter concerning
  2521	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tany difficult point; as the Trinity; the Deity; the nature of Christ;
  2522	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTransubstantiation; Free-will. &c. into any of the moderne tongues, so
  2523	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas to make the same intelligible; or into any tolerable Latine, such
  2524	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas they were acquainted withall, that lived when the Latine tongue was
  2525	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tVulgar. What is the meaning of these words. "The first cause does not
  2526	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnecessarily inflow any thing into the second, by force of the Essential
  2527	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsubordination of the second causes, by which it may help it to worke?"
  2528	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThey are the Translation of the Title of the sixth chapter of Suarez
  2529	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfirst Booke, Of The Concourse, Motion, And Help Of God. When men write
  2530	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhole volumes of such stuffe, are they not Mad, or intend to make others
  2531	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tso? And particularly, in the question of Transubstantiation; where
  2532	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tafter certain words spoken, they that say, the White-nesse, Round-nesse,
  2533	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMagni-tude, Quali-ty, Corruptibili-ty, all which are incorporeall, &c.
  2534	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgo out of the Wafer, into the Body of our blessed Saviour, do they not
  2535	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmake those Nesses, Tudes and Ties, to be so many spirits possessing his
  2536	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbody? For by Spirits, they mean alwayes things, that being incorporeall,
  2537	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare neverthelesse moveable from one place to another. So that this kind
  2538	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Absurdity, may rightly be numbred amongst the many sorts of Madnesse;
  2539	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand all the time that guided by clear Thoughts of their worldly lust,
  2540	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey forbear disputing, or writing thus, but Lucide Intervals. And thus

  2545	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCHAPTER IX. OF THE SEVERALL SUBJECTS OF KNOWLEDGE
  2546	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2547	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2548	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThere are of KNOWLEDGE two kinds; whereof one is Knowledge Of Fact: the
  2549	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother Knowledge Of The Consequence Of One Affirmation To Another. The
  2550	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tformer is nothing else, but Sense and Memory, and is Absolute Knowledge;
  2551	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas when we see a Fact doing, or remember it done: And this is the
  2552	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKnowledge required in a Witnesse. The later is called Science; and is
  2553	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConditionall; as when we know, that, If The Figure Showne Be A Circle,
  2554	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThen Any Straight Line Through The Centre Shall Divide It Into Two
  2555	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEquall Parts. And this is the Knowledge required in a Philosopher; that
  2556	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis to say, of him that pretends to Reasoning.
  2557	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2558	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Register of Knowledge Of Fact is called History. Whereof there be
  2559	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttwo sorts: one called Naturall History; which is the History of such
  2560	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFacts, or Effects of Nature, as have no Dependance on Mans Will; Such as
  2561	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare the Histories of Metals, Plants, Animals, Regions, and the like. The
  2562	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother, is Civill History; which is the History of the Voluntary Actions
  2563	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof men in Common-wealths.
  2564	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2565	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Registers of Science, are such Books as contain the Demonstrations
  2566	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Consequences of one Affirmation, to another; and are commonly called
  2567	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBooks of Philosophy; whereof the sorts are many, according to the
  2568	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdiversity of the Matter; And may be divided in such manner as I have

  2711	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2712	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe POWER of a Man, (to take it Universally,) is his present means,
  2713	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto obtain some future apparent Good. And is either Originall, or
  2714	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInstrumentall.
  2715	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2716	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNaturall Power, is the eminence of the Faculties of Body, or Mind: as
  2717	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\textraordinary Strength, Forme, Prudence, Arts, Eloquence, Liberality,
  2718	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNobility. Instrumentall are those Powers, which acquired by these, or
  2719	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby fortune, are means and Instruments to acquire more: as Riches,
  2720	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tReputation, Friends, and the Secret working of God, which men call
  2721	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGood Luck. For the nature of Power, is in this point, like to Fame,
  2722	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tincreasing as it proceeds; or like the motion of heavy bodies, which the
  2723	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfurther they go, make still the more hast.
  2724	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2725	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Greatest of humane Powers, is that which is compounded of the Powers
  2726	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof most men, united by consent, in one person, Naturall, or civill, that
  2727	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thas the use of all their Powers depending on his will; such as is the
  2728	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPower of a Common-wealth: or depending on the wills of each particular;
  2729	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch as is the Power of a Faction, or of divers factions leagued.
  2730	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTherefore to have servants, is Power; To have Friends, is Power: for
  2731	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey are strengths united.
  2732	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2733	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAlso Riches joyned with liberality, is Power; because it procureth
  2734	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfriends, and servants: Without liberality, not so; because in this case
  2735	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey defend not; but expose men to Envy, as a Prey.
  2736	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2737	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tReputation of power, is Power; because it draweth with it the adhaerance
  2738	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof those that need protection.
  2739	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2740	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSo is Reputation of love of a mans Country, (called Popularity,) for the
  2741	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsame Reason.
  2742	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2743	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAlso, what quality soever maketh a man beloved, or feared of many; or
  2744	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe reputation of such quality, is Power; because it is a means to have
  2745	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe assistance, and service of many.
  2746	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2747	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGood successe is Power; because it maketh reputation of Wisdome, or good
  2748	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfortune; which makes men either feare him, or rely on him.
  2749	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2750	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAffability of men already in power, is encrease of Power; because it
  2751	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgaineth love.
  2752	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2753	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tReputation of Prudence in the conduct of Peace or War, is Power; because
  2754	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto prudent men, we commit the government of our selves, more willingly
  2755	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthan to others.
  2756	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2757	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNobility is Power, not in all places, but onely in those Common-wealths,
  2758	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhere it has Priviledges: for in such priviledges consisteth their
  2759	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPower.
  2760	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2761	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEloquence is Power; because it is seeming Prudence.
  2762	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2763	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tForme is Power; because being a promise of Good, it recommendeth men to
  2764	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe favour of women and strangers.
  2765	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2766	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Sciences, are small Power; because not eminent; and therefore, not
  2767	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tacknowledged in any man; nor are at all, but in a few; and in them, but
  2768	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof a few things. For Science is of that nature, as none can understand
  2769	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit to be, but such as in a good measure have attayned it.
  2770	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2771	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tArts of publique use, as Fortification, making of Engines, and other
  2772	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInstruments of War; because they conferre to Defence, and Victory,
  2773	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare Power; And though the true Mother of them, be Science, namely the
  2774	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMathematiques; yet, because they are brought into the Light, by the hand
  2775	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Artificer, they be esteemed (the Midwife passing with the vulgar
  2776	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor the Mother,) as his issue.

  2781	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWorth
  2782	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2783	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Value, or WORTH of a man, is as of all other things, his Price;
  2784	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat is to say, so much as would be given for the use of his Power:
  2785	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand therefore is not absolute; but a thing dependant on the need and
  2786	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tjudgement of another. An able conductor of Souldiers, is of great Price
  2787	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin time of War present, or imminent; but in Peace not so. A learned and
  2788	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tuncorrupt Judge, is much Worth in time of Peace; but not so much in
  2789	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWar. And as in other things, so in men, not the seller, but the buyer
  2790	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdetermines the Price. For let a man (as most men do,) rate themselves as
  2791	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe highest Value they can; yet their true Value is no more than it is
  2792	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\testeemed by others.
  2793	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2794	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe manifestation of the Value we set on one another, is that which is
  2795	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommonly called Honouring, and Dishonouring. To Value a man at a high
  2796	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trate, is to Honour him; at a low rate, is to Dishonour him. But high,
  2797	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand low, in this case, is to be understood by comparison to the rate
  2798	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat each man setteth on himselfe.

  2805	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe publique worth of a man, which is the Value set on him by the
  2806	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth, is that which men commonly call DIGNITY. And this Value
  2807	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof him by the Common-wealth, is understood, by offices of Command,
  2808	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJudicature, publike Employment; or by Names and Titles, introduced for

  2819	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2820	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo obey, is to Honour; because no man obeyes them, whom they think
  2821	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave no power to help, or hurt them. And consequently to disobey, is to
  2822	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDishonour.
  2823	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2824	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo give great gifts to a man, is to Honour him; because 'tis buying
  2825	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Protection, and acknowledging of Power. To give little gifts, is to
  2826	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDishonour; because it is but Almes, and signifies an opinion of the
  2827	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tneed of small helps. To be sedulous in promoting anothers good; also
  2828	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto flatter, is to Honour; as a signe we seek his protection or ayde. To
  2829	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tneglect, is to Dishonour.
  2830	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2831	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo give way, or place to another, in any Commodity, is to Honour; being

  2834	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo shew any signe of love, or feare of another, is to Honour; for both

  2836	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfeare then he expects, is to Dishonour; for 'tis undervaluing.
  2837	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2838	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo praise, magnifie, or call happy, is to Honour; because nothing but

  2842	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo speak to another with consideration, to appear before him with

  2851	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo hearken to a mans counsell, or discourse of what kind soever, is to

  2855	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo do those things to another, which he takes for signes of Honour, or

  2860	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo agree with in opinion, is to Honour; as being a signe of approving
  2861	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this judgement, and wisdome. To dissent, is Dishonour; and an upbraiding
  2862	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof errour; and (if the dissent be in many things) of folly.
  2863	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2864	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo imitate, is to Honour; for it is vehemently to approve. To imitate
  2865	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tones Enemy, is to Dishonour.
  2866	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2867	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo honour those another honours, is to Honour him; as a signe of
  2868	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tapprobation of his judgement. To honour his Enemies, is to Dishonour
  2869	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim.
  2870	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2871	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo employ in counsell, or in actions of difficulty, is to Honour; as a
  2872	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsigne of opinion of his wisdome, or other power. To deny employment in
  2873	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe same cases, to those that seek it, is to Dishonour.
  2874	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2875	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAll these wayes of Honouring, are naturall; and as well within, as
  2876	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twithout Common-wealths. But in Common-wealths, where he, or they that
  2877	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave the supreme Authority, can make whatsoever they please, to stand
  2878	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor signes of Honour, there be other Honours.
  2879	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2880	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tA Soveraigne doth Honour a Subject, with whatsoever Title, or Office, or
  2881	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEmployment, or Action, that he himselfe will have taken for a signe of
  2882	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this will to Honour him.
  2883	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2884	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe King of Persia, Honoured Mordecay, when he appointed he should be
  2885	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconducted through the streets in the Kings Garment, upon one of the
  2886	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKings Horses, with a Crown on his head, and a Prince before him,
  2887	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tproclayming, "Thus shall it be done to him that the King will honour."
  2888	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd yet another King of Persia, or the same another time, to one that
  2889	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdemanded for some great service, to weare one of the Kings robes, gave
  2890	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim leave so to do; but with his addition, that he should weare it as
  2891	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Kings foole; and then it was Dishonour. So that of Civill Honour;
  2892	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch as are Magistracy, Offices, Titles; and in some places Coats, and
  2893	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tScutchions painted: and men Honour such as have them, as having so many
  2894	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsignes of favour in the Common-wealth; which favour is Power.
  2895	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2896	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHonourable is whatsoever possession, action, or quality, is an argument
  2897	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand signe of Power.
  2898	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2899	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd therefore To be Honoured, loved, or feared of many, is Honourable;
  2900	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas arguments of Power. To be Honoured of few or none, Dishonourable.
  2901	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2902	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGood fortune (if lasting,) Honourable; as a signe of the favour of God.
  2903	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIll fortune, and losses, Dishonourable. Riches, are Honourable; for
  2904	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey are Power. Poverty, Dishonourable. Magnanimity, Liberality,
  2905	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHope, Courage, Confidence, are Honourable; for they proceed from the
  2906	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconscience of Power. Pusillanimity, Parsimony, Fear, Diffidence, are
  2907	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDishonourable.
  2908	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2909	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTimely Resolution, or determination of what a man is to do, is
  2910	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHonourable; as being the contempt of small difficulties, and dangers.
  2911	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd Irresolution, Dishonourable; as a signe of too much valuing of
  2912	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlittle impediments, and little advantages: For when a man has weighed
  2913	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthings as long as the time permits, and resolves not, the difference
  2914	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof weight is but little; and therefore if he resolve not, he overvalues
  2915	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlittle things, which is Pusillanimity.
  2916	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2917	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAll Actions, and Speeches, that proceed, or seem to proceed from much
  2918	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tExperience, Science, Discretion, or Wit, are Honourable; For all these
  2919	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare Powers. Actions, or Words that proceed from Errour, Ignorance, or
  2920	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFolly, Dishonourable.
  2921	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2922	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGravity, as farre forth as it seems to proceed from a mind employed on
  2923	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsome thing else, is Honourable; because employment is a signe of
  2924	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPower. But if it seem to proceed from a purpose to appear grave, it is
  2925	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDishonourable. For the gravity of the Former, is like the steddinesse of
  2926	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Ship laden with Merchandise; but of the later, like the steddinesse of
  2927	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Ship ballasted with Sand, and other trash.
  2928	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2929	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo be Conspicuous, that is to say, to be known, for Wealth, Office,
  2930	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgreat Actions, or any eminent Good, is Honourable; as a signe of the
  2931	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpower for which he is conspicuous. On the contrary, Obscurity, is
  2932	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDishonourable.
  2933	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2934	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo be descended from conspicuous Parents, is Honourable; because they
  2935	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe more easily attain the aydes, and friends of their Ancestors. On the
  2936	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontrary, to be descended from obscure Parentage, is Dishonourable.
  2937	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2938	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tActions proceeding from Equity, joyned with losse, are Honourable;
  2939	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas signes of Magnanimity: for Magnanimity is a signe of Power. On the
  2940	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontrary, Craft, Shifting, neglect of Equity, is Dishonourable.
  2941	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2942	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNor does it alter the case of Honour, whether an action (so it be great
  2943	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand difficult, and consequently a signe of much power,) be just or
  2944	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunjust: for Honour consisteth onely in the opinion of Power. Therefore
  2945	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe ancient Heathen did not thinke they Dishonoured, but greatly
  2946	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHonoured the Gods, when they introduced them in their Poems, committing
  2947	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRapes, Thefts, and other great, but unjust, or unclean acts: In so much
  2948	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas nothing is so much celebrated in Jupiter, as his Adulteries; nor
  2949	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin Mercury, as his Frauds, and Thefts: of whose praises, in a hymne
  2950	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Homer, the greatest is this, that being born in the morning, he had
  2951	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinvented Musique at noon, and before night, stolen away the Cattell of
  2952	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAppollo, from his Herdsmen.
  2953	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2954	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAlso amongst men, till there were constituted great Common-wealths,
  2955	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit was thought no dishonour to be a Pyrate, or a High-way Theefe; but
  2956	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trather a lawfull Trade, not onely amongst the Greeks, but also amongst
  2957	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall other Nations; as is manifest by the Histories of antient time. And
  2958	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tat this day, in this part of the world, private Duels are, and alwayes
  2959	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twill be Honourable, though unlawfull, till such time as there shall be
  2960	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHonour ordained for them that refuse, and Ignominy for them that make
  2961	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Challenge. For Duels also are many times effects of Courage; and the
  2962	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tground of Courage is alwayes Strength or Skill, which are Power; though
  2963	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor the most part they be effects of rash speaking, and of the fear of
  2964	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDishonour, in one, or both the Combatants; who engaged by rashnesse, are
  2965	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdriven into the Lists to avoyd disgrace.
  2966	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2967	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tScutchions, and coats of Armes haereditary, where they have any eminent
  2968	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPriviledges, are Honourable; otherwise not: for their Power consisteth
  2969	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teither in such Priviledges, or in Riches, or some such thing as is
  2970	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tequally honoured in other men. This kind of Honour, commonly called
  2971	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGentry, has been derived from the Antient Germans. For there never was
  2972	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tany such thing known, where the German Customes were unknown. Nor is it
  2973	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnow any where in use, where the Germans have not inhabited. The antient
  2974	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGreek Commanders, when they went to war, had their Shields painted with
  2975	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch Devises as they pleased; insomuch as an unpainted Buckler was a
  2976	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsigne of Poverty, and of a common Souldier: but they transmitted not the
  2977	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInheritance of them. The Romans transmitted the Marks of their Families:
  2978	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut they were the Images, not the Devises of their Ancestors. Amongst
  2979	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe people of Asia, Afrique, and America, there is not, nor was ever,
  2980	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tany such thing. The Germans onely had that custome; from whom it has
  2981	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeen derived into England, France, Spain, and Italy, when in great
  2982	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnumbers they either ayded the Romans, or made their own Conquests in
  2983	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthese Westerne parts of the world.
  2984	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  2985	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor Germany, being antiently, as all other Countries, in their
  2986	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeginnings, divided amongst an infinite number of little Lords, or
  2987	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMasters of Families, that continually had wars one with another; those
  2988	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMasters, or Lords, principally to the end they might, when they were
  2989	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCovered with Arms, be known by their followers; and partly for ornament,
  2990	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tboth painted their Armor, or their Scutchion, or Coat, with the picture
  2991	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof some Beast, or other thing; and also put some eminent and visible
  2992	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmark upon the Crest of their Helmets. And his ornament both of the
  2993	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tArmes, and Crest, descended by inheritance to their Children; to the
  2994	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teldest pure, and to the rest with some note of diversity, such as the
  2995	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOld master, that is to say in Dutch, the Here-alt thought fit. But when
  2996	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmany such Families, joyned together, made a greater Monarchy, this duty
  2997	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Herealt, to distinguish Scutchions, was made a private Office
  2998	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta part. And the issue of these Lords, is the great and antient Gentry;
  2999	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich for the most part bear living creatures, noted for courage, and
  3000	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trapine; or Castles, Battlements, Belts, Weapons, Bars, Palisadoes, and
  3001	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother notes of War; nothing being then in honour, but vertue military.
  3002	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAfterwards, not onely Kings, but popular Common-wealths, gave divers
  3003	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmanners of Scutchions, to such as went forth to the War, or returned
  3004	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom it, for encouragement, or recompence to their service. All which,
  3005	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby an observing Reader, may be found in such ancient Histories, Greek
  3006	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Latine, as make mention of the German Nation, and Manners, in their
  3007	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttimes.

  3013	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3014	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTitles of Honour, such as are Duke, Count, Marquis, and Baron, are
  3015	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHonourable; as signifying the value set upon them by the Soveraigne
  3016	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPower of the Common-wealth: Which Titles, were in old time titles
  3017	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Office, and Command, derived some from the Romans, some from the
  3018	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGermans, and French. Dukes, in Latine Duces, being Generalls in War:
  3019	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCounts, Comites, such as bare the Generall company out of friendship;
  3020	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand were left to govern and defend places conquered, and pacified:
  3021	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMarquises, Marchiones, were Counts that governed the Marches, or bounds
  3022	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Empire. Which titles of Duke, Count, and Marquis, came into the
  3023	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEmpire, about the time of Constantine the Great, from the customes of
  3024	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe German Militia. But Baron, seems to have been a Title of the Gaules,
  3025	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand signifies a Great man; such as were the Kings, or Princes men, whom
  3026	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey employed in war about their persons; and seems to be derived from
  3027	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tVir, to Ber, and Bar, that signified the same in the Language of the
  3028	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGaules, that Vir in Latine; and thence to Bero, and Baro: so that such
  3029	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen were called Berones, and after Barones; and (in Spanish) Varones.
  3030	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut he that would know more particularly the originall of Titles of
  3031	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHonour, may find it, as I have done this, in Mr. Seldens most excellent
  3032	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTreatise of that subject. In processe of time these offices of Honour,
  3033	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby occasion of trouble, and for reasons of good and peacable government,
  3034	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere turned into meer Titles; serving for the most part, to distinguish
  3035	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe precedence, place, and order of subjects in the Common-wealth: and
  3036	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen were made Dukes, Counts, Marquises, and Barons of Places, wherein
  3037	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey had neither possession, nor command: and other Titles also, were
  3038	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdevised to the same end.

  3045	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWORTHINESSE, is a thing different from the worth, or value of a man; and
  3046	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talso from his merit, or desert; and consisteth in a particular power,
  3047	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor ability for that, whereof he is said to be worthy: which particular
  3048	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tability, is usually named FITNESSE, or Aptitude.
  3049	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3050	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor he is Worthiest to be a Commander, to be a Judge, or to have any
  3051	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother charge, that is best fitted, with the qualities required to the
  3052	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twell discharging of it; and Worthiest of Riches, that has the qualities
  3053	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmost requisite for the well using of them: any of which qualities being
  3054	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tabsent, one may neverthelesse be a Worthy man, and valuable for
  3055	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsome thing else. Again, a man may be Worthy of Riches, Office, and
  3056	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEmployment, that neverthelesse, can plead no right to have it before
  3057	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tanother; and therefore cannot be said to merit or deserve it. For Merit,

  3065	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3066	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3067	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3068	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3069	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhat Is Here Meant By Manners
  3070	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3071	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBy MANNERS, I mean not here, Decency of behaviour; as how one man should
  3072	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsalute another, or how a man should wash his mouth, or pick his teeth
  3073	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbefore company, and such other points of the Small Morals; But those
  3074	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tqualities of man-kind, that concern their living together in Peace, and
  3075	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tUnity. To which end we are to consider, that the Felicity of this life,
  3076	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsisteth not in the repose of a mind satisfied. For there is no such
  3077	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFinis Ultimus, (utmost ayme,) nor Summum Bonum, (greatest good,) as is
  3078	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tspoken of in the Books of the old Morall Philosophers. Nor can a man
  3079	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tany more live, whose Desires are at an end, than he, whose Senses and
  3080	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tImaginations are at a stand. Felicity is a continuall progresse of the
  3081	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdesire, from one object to another; the attaining of the former, being
  3082	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tstill but the way to the later. The cause whereof is, That the object
  3083	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof mans desire, is not to enjoy once onely, and for one instant of time;
  3084	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut to assure for ever, the way of his future desire. And therefore the
  3085	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tvoluntary actions, and inclinations of all men, tend, not only to the
  3086	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprocuring, but also to the assuring of a contented life; and differ
  3087	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tonely in the way: which ariseth partly from the diversity of passions,
  3088	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin divers men; and partly from the difference of the knowledge, or
  3089	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\topinion each one has of the causes, which produce the effect desired.
  3090	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t

  3094	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tA Restlesse Desire Of Power, In All Men
  3095	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3096	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSo that in the first place, I put for a generall inclination of all
  3097	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmankind, a perpetuall and restlesse desire of Power after power, that
  3098	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tceaseth onely in Death. And the cause of this, is not alwayes that a man
  3099	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thopes for a more intensive delight, than he has already attained to; or
  3100	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat he cannot be content with a moderate power: but because he cannot
  3101	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tassure the power and means to live well, which he hath present, without
  3102	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe acquisition of more. And from hence it is, that Kings, whose power
  3103	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis greatest, turn their endeavours to the assuring it a home by Lawes,
  3104	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor abroad by Wars: and when that is done, there succeedeth a new desire;
  3105	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin some, of Fame from new Conquest; in others, of ease and sensuall
  3106	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpleasure; in others, of admiration, or being flattered for excellence in
  3107	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsome art, or other ability of the mind.

  3114	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCompetition of Riches, Honour, command, or other power, enclineth to
  3115	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tContention, Enmity, and War: because the way of one Competitor, to the
  3116	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tattaining of his desire, is to kill, subdue, supplant, or repell the
  3117	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother. Particularly, competition of praise, enclineth to a reverence of
  3118	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAntiquity. For men contend with the living, not with the dead; to these
  3119	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tascribing more than due, that they may obscure the glory of the other.

  3180	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tacceptation, (which men call Gratitude,) is such an honour done to

  3297	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3298	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFrom the same it proceedeth, that men give different names, to one and
  3299	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe same thing, from the difference of their own passions: As they that

  3301	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHaeresie: and yet haeresie signifies no more than private opinion; but

  3303	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3304	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFrom the same also it proceedeth, that men cannot distinguish, without
  3305	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tstudy and great understanding, between one action of many men, and many
  3306	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tactions of one multitude; as for example, between the one action of
  3307	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall the Senators of Rome in killing Catiline, and the many actions of a
  3308	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnumber of Senators in killing Caesar; and therefore are disposed to take
  3309	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor the action of the people, that which is a multitude of actions done

  3313	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIgnorance of the causes, and originall constitution of Right, Equity,
  3314	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaw, and Justice, disposeth a man to make Custome and Example the rule
  3315	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof his actions; in such manner, as to think that Unjust which it
  3316	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thath been the custome to punish; and that Just, of the impunity and
  3317	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tapprobation whereof they can produce an Example, or (as the Lawyers
  3318	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich onely use the false measure of Justice barbarously call it) a
  3319	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPrecedent; like little children, that have no other rule of good and
  3320	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevill manners, but the correction they receive from their Parents, and
  3321	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMasters; save that children are constant to their rule, whereas men are
  3322	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot so; because grown strong, and stubborn, they appeale from custome
  3323	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto reason, and from reason to custome, as it serves their turn; receding
  3324	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom custome when their interest requires it, and setting themselves
  3325	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagainst reason, as oft as reason is against them: Which is the cause,
  3326	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat the doctrine of Right and Wrong, is perpetually disputed, both by
  3327	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Pen and the Sword: whereas the doctrine of Lines, and Figures, is
  3328	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot so; because men care not, in that subject what be truth, as a thing
  3329	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat crosses no mans ambition, profit, or lust. For I doubt not, but if
  3330	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit had been a thing contrary to any mans right of dominion, or to the

  3390	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3391	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd they that make little, or no enquiry into the naturall causes of
  3392	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthings, yet from the feare that proceeds from the ignorance it selfe,
  3393	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof what it is that hath the power to do them much good or harm, are
  3394	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tenclined to suppose, and feign unto themselves, severall kinds of Powers
  3395	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInvisible; and to stand in awe of their own imaginations; and in time
  3396	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof distresse to invoke them; as also in the time of an expected good
  3397	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuccesse, to give them thanks; making the creatures of their own
  3398	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfancy, their Gods. By which means it hath come to passe, that from the
  3399	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinnumerable variety of Fancy, men have created in the world innumerable
  3400	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsorts of Gods. And this Feare of things invisible, is the naturall Seed
  3401	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof that, which every one in himself calleth Religion; and in them that
  3402	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tworship, or feare that Power otherwise than they do, Superstition.
  3403	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3404	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd this seed of Religion, having been observed by many; some of those
  3405	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat have observed it, have been enclined thereby to nourish, dresse,
  3406	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand forme it into Lawes; and to adde to it of their own invention,
  3407	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tany opinion of the causes of future events, by which they thought they
  3408	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshould best be able to govern others, and make unto themselves the

  3418	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tReligion, In Man Onely
  3419	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3420	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSeeing there are no signes, nor fruit of Religion, but in Man onely;
  3421	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere is no cause to doubt, but that the seed of Religion, is also onely
  3422	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin Man; and consisteth in some peculiar quality, or at least in some
  3423	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teminent degree thereof, not to be found in other Living creatures.

  3429	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3430	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd first, it is peculiar to the nature of Man, to be inquisitive into
  3431	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Causes of the Events they see, some more, some lesse; but all men so
  3432	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmuch, as to be curious in the search of the causes of their own good and
  3433	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevill fortune.
  3434	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3435	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t

  3438	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFrom The Consideration Of The Beginning Of Things
  3439	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3440	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSecondly, upon the sight of any thing that hath a Beginning, to think
  3441	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talso it had a cause, which determined the same to begin, then when it
  3442	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdid, rather than sooner or later.

  3447	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFrom His Observation Of The Sequell Of Things
  3448	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3449	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThirdly, whereas there is no other Felicity of Beasts, but the enjoying
  3450	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof their quotidian Food, Ease, and Lusts; as having little, or no
  3451	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tforesight of the time to come, for want of observation, and memory
  3452	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the order, consequence, and dependance of the things they see; Man
  3453	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobserveth how one Event hath been produced by another; and remembreth in
  3454	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem Antecedence and Consequence; And when he cannot assure himselfe of
  3455	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe true causes of things, (for the causes of good and evill fortune for
  3456	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe most part are invisible,) he supposes causes of them, either such
  3457	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas his own fancy suggesteth; or trusteth to the Authority of other men,
  3458	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch as he thinks to be his friends, and wiser than himselfe.
  3459	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3460	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Naturall Cause Of Religion, The Anxiety Of The Time To Come The
  3461	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttwo first, make Anxiety. For being assured that there be causes of all
  3462	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthings that have arrived hitherto, or shall arrive hereafter; it is
  3463	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\timpossible for a man, who continually endeavoureth to secure himselfe
  3464	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagainst the evill he feares, and procure the good he desireth, not to
  3465	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe in a perpetuall solicitude of the time to come; So that every man,
  3466	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tespecially those that are over provident, are in an estate like to that
  3467	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Prometheus. For as Prometheus, (which interpreted, is, The Prudent
  3468	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMan,) was bound to the hill Caucasus, a place of large prospect, where,
  3469	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tan Eagle feeding on his liver, devoured in the day, as much as was
  3470	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trepayred in the night: So that man, which looks too far before him, in
  3471	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe care of future time, hath his heart all the day long, gnawed on by
  3472	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfeare of death, poverty, or other calamity; and has no repose, nor pause
  3473	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof his anxiety, but in sleep.
  3474	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3475	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3476	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3477	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3478	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhich Makes Them Fear The Power Of Invisible Things
  3479	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3480	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThis perpetuall feare, alwayes accompanying mankind in the ignorance of
  3481	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcauses, as it were in the Dark, must needs have for object something.
  3482	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd therefore when there is nothing to be seen, there is nothing to
  3483	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\taccuse, either of their good, or evill fortune, but some Power, or Agent
  3484	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInvisible: In which sense perhaps it was, that some of the old Poets
  3485	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsaid, that the Gods were at first created by humane Feare: which spoken
  3486	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Gods, (that is to say, of the many Gods of the Gentiles) is
  3487	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tvery true. But the acknowledging of one God Eternall, Infinite, and
  3488	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOmnipotent, may more easily be derived, from the desire men have to
  3489	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tknow the causes of naturall bodies, and their severall vertues, and
  3490	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\toperations; than from the feare of what was to befall them in time to
  3491	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcome. For he that from any effect hee seeth come to passe, should reason
  3492	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto the next and immediate cause thereof, and from thence to the cause
  3493	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof that cause, and plonge himselfe profoundly in the pursuit of causes;
  3494	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshall at last come to this, that there must be (as even the Heathen
  3495	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPhilosophers confessed) one First Mover; that is, a First, and an
  3496	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEternall cause of all things; which is that which men mean by the name
  3497	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof God: And all this without thought of their fortune; the solicitude
  3498	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhereof, both enclines to fear, and hinders them from the search of the
  3499	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcauses of other things; and thereby gives occasion of feigning of as
  3500	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmany Gods, as there be men that feigne them.
  3501	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3502	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3503	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3504	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3505	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd Suppose Them Incorporeall
  3506	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3507	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd for the matter, or substance of the Invisible Agents, so fancyed;
  3508	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey could not by naturall cogitation, fall upon any other conceipt, but
  3509	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat it was the same with that of the Soule of man; and that the Soule
  3510	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof man, was of the same substance, with that which appeareth in a Dream,
  3511	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto one that sleepeth; or in a Looking-glasse, to one that is awake;
  3512	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich, men not knowing that such apparitions are nothing else but
  3513	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcreatures of the Fancy, think to be reall, and externall Substances;
  3514	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand therefore call them Ghosts; as the Latines called them Imagines,
  3515	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Umbrae; and thought them Spirits, that is, thin aereall bodies; and
  3516	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose Invisible Agents, which they feared, to bee like them; save that
  3517	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey appear, and vanish when they please. But the opinion that such
  3518	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSpirits were Incorporeall, or Immateriall, could never enter into the
  3519	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmind of any man by nature; because, though men may put together words of
  3520	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontradictory signification, as Spirit, and Incorporeall; yet they
  3521	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcan never have the imagination of any thing answering to them:
  3522	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd therefore, men that by their own meditation, arrive to the
  3523	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tacknowledgement of one Infinite, Omnipotent, and Eternall God,
  3524	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tchoose rather to confesse he is Incomprehensible, and above their
  3525	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunderstanding; than to define his Nature By Spirit Incorporeall, and
  3526	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthen Confesse their definition to be unintelligible: or if they give him
  3527	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch a title, it is not Dogmatically, with intention to make the Divine
  3528	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNature understood; but Piously, to honour him with attributes, of
  3529	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsignifications, as remote as they can from the grossenesse of Bodies
  3530	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tVisible.
  3531	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3532	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3533	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3534	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3535	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut Know Not The Way How They Effect Anything
  3536	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3537	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThen, for the way by which they think these Invisible Agents wrought
  3538	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir effects; that is to say, what immediate causes they used, in
  3539	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbringing things to passe, men that know not what it is that we call
  3540	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCausing, (that is, almost all men) have no other rule to guesse by, but
  3541	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby observing, and remembring what they have seen to precede the like
  3542	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teffect at some other time, or times before, without seeing between the
  3543	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tantecedent and subsequent Event, any dependance or connexion at all:
  3544	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd therefore from the like things past, they expect the like things to
  3545	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcome; and hope for good or evill luck, superstitiously, from things that
  3546	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave no part at all in the causing of it: As the Athenians did for their
  3547	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twar at Lepanto, demand another Phormio; the Pompeian faction for their
  3548	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twarre in Afrique, another Scipio; and others have done in divers other
  3549	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\toccasions since. In like manner they attribute their fortune to a
  3550	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tstander by, to a lucky or unlucky place, to words spoken, especially
  3551	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tif the name of God be amongst them; as Charming, and Conjuring (the
  3552	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLeiturgy of Witches;) insomuch as to believe, they have power to turn a
  3553	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tstone into bread, bread into a man, or any thing, into any thing.
  3554	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3555	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3556	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3557	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3558	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut Honour Them As They Honour Men
  3559	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3560	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThirdly, for the worship which naturally men exhibite to Powers
  3561	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinvisible, it can be no other, but such expressions of their reverence,
  3562	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas they would use towards men; Gifts, Petitions, Thanks, Submission
  3563	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Body, Considerate Addresses, sober Behaviour, premeditated Words,
  3564	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSwearing (that is, assuring one another of their promises,) by invoking
  3565	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem. Beyond that reason suggesteth nothing; but leaves them either to
  3566	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trest there; or for further ceremonies, to rely on those they believe to
  3567	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe wiser than themselves.
  3568	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3569	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3570	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3571	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3572	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd Attribute To Them All Extraordinary Events
  3573	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3574	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLastly, concerning how these Invisible Powers declare to men the things
  3575	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich shall hereafter come to passe, especially concerning their good
  3576	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor evill fortune in generall, or good or ill successe in any particular
  3577	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tundertaking, men are naturally at a stand; save that using to conjecture
  3578	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the time to come, by the time past, they are very apt, not onely to
  3579	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttake casuall things, after one or two encounters, for Prognostiques
  3580	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the like encounter ever after, but also to believe the like
  3581	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPrognostiques from other men, of whom they have once conceived a good
  3582	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\topinion.

  3587	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFoure Things, Naturall Seeds Of Religion
  3588	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3589	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd in these foure things, Opinion of Ghosts, Ignorance of second
  3590	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcauses, Devotion towards what men fear, and Taking of things Casuall for
  3591	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPrognostiques, consisteth the Naturall seed of Religion; which by reason
  3592	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the different Fancies, Judgements, and Passions of severall men, hath
  3593	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgrown up into ceremonies so different, that those which are used by one
  3594	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman, are for the most part ridiculous to another.
  3595	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3596	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3597	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3598	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3599	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMade Different By Culture
  3600	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3601	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor these seeds have received culture from two sorts of men. One sort
  3602	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave been they, that have nourished, and ordered them, according to
  3603	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir own invention. The other, have done it, by Gods commandement, and
  3604	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdirection: but both sorts have done it, with a purpose to make those men
  3605	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat relyed on them, the more apt to Obedience, Lawes, Peace, Charity,
  3606	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand civill Society. So that the Religion of the former sort, is a part
  3607	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof humane Politiques; and teacheth part of the duty which Earthly Kings
  3608	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trequire of their Subjects. And the Religion of the later sort is
  3609	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDivine Politiques; and containeth Precepts to those that have yeelded
  3610	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthemselves subjects in the Kingdome of God. Of the former sort, were all
  3611	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Founders of Common-wealths, and the Law-givers of the Gentiles: Of
  3612	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe later sort, were Abraham, Moses, and our Blessed Saviour; by whom
  3613	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave been derived unto us the Lawes of the Kingdome of God.
  3614	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t

  3618	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Absurd Opinion Of Gentilisme
  3619	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3620	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd for that part of Religion, which consisteth in opinions concerning
  3621	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe nature of Powers Invisible, there is almost nothing that has a
  3622	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tname, that has not been esteemed amongst the Gentiles, in one place or
  3623	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tanother, a God, or Divell; or by their Poets feigned to be inanimated,
  3624	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinhabited, or possessed by some Spirit or other.
  3625	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3626	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe unformed matter of the World, was a God, by the name of Chaos.
  3627	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3628	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Heaven, the Ocean, the Planets, the Fire, the Earth, the Winds, were
  3629	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tso many Gods.

  3631	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMen, Women, a Bird, a Crocodile, a Calf, a Dogge, a Snake, an Onion,
  3632	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Leeke, Deified. Besides, that they filled almost all places, with
  3633	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tspirits called Daemons; the plains, with Pan, and Panises, or Satyres;
  3634	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Woods, with Fawnes, and Nymphs; the Sea, with Tritons, and other
  3635	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNymphs; every River, and Fountayn, with a Ghost of his name, and with
  3636	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNymphs; every house, with it Lares, or Familiars; every man, with his
  3637	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGenius; Hell, with Ghosts, and spirituall Officers, as Charon, Cerberus,
  3638	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand the Furies; and in the night time, all places with Larvae, Lemures,
  3639	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGhosts of men deceased, and a whole kingdome of Fayries, and Bugbears.
  3640	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThey have also ascribed Divinity, and built Temples to meer Accidents,
  3641	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Qualities; such as are Time, Night, Day, Peace, Concord, Love,
  3642	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tContention, Vertue, Honour, Health, Rust, Fever, and the like; which
  3643	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhen they prayed for, or against, they prayed to, as if there were
  3644	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGhosts of those names hanging over their heads, and letting fall, or
  3645	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twithholding that Good, or Evill, for, or against which they prayed. They
  3646	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinvoked also their own Wit, by the name of Muses; their own Ignorance,
  3647	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby the name of Fortune; their own Lust, by the name of Cupid; their
  3648	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\town Rage, by the name Furies; their own privy members by the name of
  3649	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPriapus; and attributed their pollutions, to Incubi, and Succubae:
  3650	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinsomuch as there was nothing, which a Poet could introduce as a person
  3651	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin his Poem, which they did not make either a God, or a Divel.

  3654	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tground for Religion, which is mens Ignorance of causes; and thereby
  3655	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir aptnesse to attribute their fortune to causes, on which there
  3656	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas no dependence at all apparent, took occasion to obtrude on their
  3657	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tignorance, in stead of second causes, a kind of second and ministeriall
  3658	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGods; ascribing the cause of Foecundity, to Venus; the cause of Arts, to
  3659	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tApollo; of Subtilty and Craft, to Mercury; of Tempests and stormes,
  3660	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto Aeolus; and of other effects, to other Gods: insomuch as there was
  3661	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tamongst the Heathen almost as great variety of Gods, as of businesse.
  3662	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3663	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd to the Worship, which naturally men conceived fit to bee used
  3664	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttowards their Gods, namely Oblations, Prayers, Thanks, and the rest
  3665	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tformerly named; the same Legislators of the Gentiles have added their
  3666	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tImages, both in Picture, and Sculpture; that the more ignorant sort,
  3667	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(that is to say, the most part, or generality of the people,) thinking
  3668	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Gods for whose representation they were made, were really included,
  3669	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand as it were housed within them, might so much the more stand in feare
  3670	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof them: And endowed them with lands, and houses, and officers, and
  3671	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trevenues, set apart from all other humane uses; that is, consecrated,
  3672	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand made holy to those their Idols; as Caverns, Groves, Woods,
  3673	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMountains, and whole Ilands; and have attributed to them, not onely
  3674	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe shapes, some of Men, some of Beasts, some of Monsters; but also the
  3675	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFaculties, and Passions of men and beasts; as Sense, Speech, Sex, Lust,
  3676	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGeneration, (and this not onely by mixing one with another, to propagate
  3677	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe kind of Gods; but also by mixing with men, and women, to beget
  3678	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmongrill Gods, and but inmates of Heaven, as Bacchus, Hercules,

  3683	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttaken to be against Law, rather than against Honour.
  3684	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3685	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLastly, to the Prognostiques of time to come; which are naturally, but
  3686	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConjectures upon the Experience of time past; and supernaturall, divine
  3687	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRevelation; the same authors of the Religion of the Gentiles, partly
  3688	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tupon pretended Experience, partly upon pretended Revelation, have
  3689	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tadded innumerable other superstitious wayes of Divination; and made men
  3690	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbelieve they should find their fortunes, sometimes in the ambiguous
  3691	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor senslesse answers of the priests at Delphi, Delos, Ammon, and other
  3692	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfamous Oracles; which answers, were made ambiguous by designe, to own
  3693	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe event both wayes; or absurd by the intoxicating vapour of the place,
  3694	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich is very frequent in sulphurous Cavernes: Sometimes in the leaves
  3695	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Sibills; of whose Prophecyes (like those perhaps of Nostradamus;
  3696	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor the fragments now extant seem to be the invention of later times)
  3697	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere were some books in reputation in the time of the Roman Republique:
  3698	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSometimes in the insignificant Speeches of Mad-men, supposed to
  3699	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe possessed with a divine Spirit; which Possession they called
  3700	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEnthusiasme; and these kinds of foretelling events, were accounted
  3701	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTheomancy, or Prophecy; Sometimes in the aspect of the Starres at their
  3702	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNativity; which was called Horoscopy, and esteemed a part of judiciary
  3703	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAstrology: Sometimes in their own hopes and feares, called Thumomancy,
  3704	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor Presage: Sometimes in the Prediction of Witches, that pretended
  3705	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconference with the dead; which is called Necromancy, Conjuring, and
  3706	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWitchcraft; and is but juggling and confederate knavery: Sometimes in
  3707	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Casuall flight, or feeding of birds; called Augury: Sometimes in
  3708	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Entrayles of a sacrificed beast; which was Aruspicina: Sometimes
  3709	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin Dreams: Sometimes in Croaking of Ravens, or chattering of Birds:
  3710	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSometimes in the Lineaments of the face; which was called Metoposcopy;
  3711	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor by Palmistry in the lines of the hand; in casuall words, called
  3712	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOmina: Sometimes in Monsters, or unusuall accidents; as Ecclipses,
  3713	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tComets, rare Meteors, Earthquakes, Inundations, uncouth Births, and the
  3714	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlike, which they called Portenta and Ostenta, because they thought them
  3715	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto portend, or foreshew some great Calamity to come; Sometimes, in meer
  3716	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLottery, as Crosse and Pile; counting holes in a sive; dipping of Verses
  3717	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin Homer, and Virgil; and innumerable other such vaine conceipts. So
  3718	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teasie are men to be drawn to believe any thing, from such men as have
  3719	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgotten credit with them; and can with gentlenesse, and dexterity, take
  3720	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thold of their fear, and ignorance.

  3722	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Designes Of The Authors Of The Religion Of The Heathen And therefore
  3723	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe first Founders, and Legislators of Common-wealths amongst the
  3724	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGentiles, whose ends were only to keep the people in obedience, and
  3725	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpeace, have in all places taken care; First, to imprint in their minds a
  3726	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeliefe, that those precepts which they gave concerning Religion, might
  3727	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot be thought to proceed from their own device, but from the dictates
  3728	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof some God, or other Spirit; or else that they themselves were of a
  3729	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thigher nature than mere mortalls, that their Lawes might the more easily
  3730	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe received: So Numa Pompilius pretended to receive the Ceremonies he
  3731	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinstituted amongst the Romans, from the Nymph Egeria: and the first King
  3732	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand founder of the Kingdome of Peru, pretended himselfe and his wife to
  3733	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe the children of the Sunne: and Mahomet, to set up his new Religion,
  3734	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpretended to have conferences with the Holy Ghost, in forme of a Dove.
  3735	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSecondly, they have had a care, to make it believed, that the same
  3736	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthings were displeasing to the Gods, which were forbidden by the
  3737	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLawes. Thirdly, to prescribe Ceremonies, Supplications, Sacrifices, and
  3738	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFestivalls, by which they were to believe, the anger of the Gods might
  3739	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe appeased; and that ill success in War, great contagions of Sicknesse,
  3740	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEarthquakes, and each mans private Misery, came from the Anger of
  3741	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Gods; and their Anger from the Neglect of their Worship, or the
  3742	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tforgetting, or mistaking some point of the Ceremonies required. And
  3743	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthough amongst the antient Romans, men were not forbidden to deny, that
  3744	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich in the Poets is written of the paines, and pleasures after this
  3745	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlife; which divers of great authority, and gravity in that state have
  3746	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin their Harangues openly derided; yet that beliefe was alwaies more
  3747	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcherished, than the contrary.
  3748	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3749	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd by these, and such other Institutions, they obtayned in order to
  3750	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir end, (which was the peace of the Commonwealth,) that the common
  3751	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpeople in their misfortunes, laying the fault on neglect, or errour in
  3752	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir Ceremonies, or on their own disobedience to the lawes, were the
  3753	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlesse apt to mutiny against their Governors. And being entertained with
  3754	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe pomp, and pastime of Festivalls, and publike Gomes, made in
  3755	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thonour of the Gods, needed nothing else but bread, to keep them from
  3756	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdiscontent, murmuring, and commotion against the State. And therefore
  3757	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Romans, that had conquered the greatest part of the then known
  3758	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWorld, made no scruple of tollerating any Religion whatsoever in the
  3759	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCity of Rome it selfe; unlesse it had somthing in it, that could not
  3760	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsist with their Civill Government; nor do we read, that any Religion
  3761	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas there forbidden, but that of the Jewes; who (being the peculiar
  3762	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKingdome of God) thought it unlawfull to acknowledge subjection to any
  3763	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmortall King or State whatsoever. And thus you see how the Religion of
  3764	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Gentiles was a part of their Policy.
  3765	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3766	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe True Religion, And The Lawes Of Gods Kingdome The Same But where God
  3767	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thimselfe, by supernaturall Revelation, planted Religion; there he
  3768	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talso made to himselfe a peculiar Kingdome; and gave Lawes, not only of
  3769	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbehaviour towards himselfe; but also towards one another; and thereby
  3770	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the Kingdome of God, the Policy, and lawes Civill, are a part of
  3771	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tReligion; and therefore the distinction of Temporall, and Spirituall
  3772	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDomination, hath there no place. It is true, that God is King of all the
  3773	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEarth: Yet may he be King of a peculiar, and chosen Nation. For there is
  3774	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tno more incongruity therein, than that he that hath the generall command
  3775	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the whole Army, should have withall a peculiar Regiment, or Company
  3776	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof his own. God is King of all the Earth by his Power: but of his
  3777	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tchosen people, he is King by Covenant. But to speake more largly of the
  3778	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKingdome of God, both by Nature, and Covenant, I have in the following
  3779	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdiscourse assigned an other place.

  3784	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Causes Of Change In Religion
  3785	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3786	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFrom the propagation of Religion, it is not hard to understand
  3787	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe causes of the resolution of the same into its first seeds, or
  3788	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprinciples; which are only an opinion of a Deity, and Powers invisible,
  3789	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand supernaturall; that can never be so abolished out of humane nature,
  3790	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut that new Religions may againe be made to spring out of them, by the
  3791	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tculture of such men, as for such purpose are in reputation.
  3792	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3793	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor seeing all formed Religion, is founded at first, upon the faith
  3794	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich a multitude hath in some one person, whom they believe not only to
  3795	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe a wise man, and to labour to procure their happiness, but also to
  3796	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe a holy man, to whom God himselfe vouchsafeth to declare his will
  3797	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsupernaturally; It followeth necessarily, when they that have the
  3798	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGoverment of Religion, shall come to have either the wisedome of those
  3799	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen, their sincerity, or their love suspected; or that they shall
  3800	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe unable to shew any probable token of divine Revelation; that the
  3801	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tReligion which they desire to uphold, must be suspected likewise; and
  3802	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(without the feare of the Civill Sword) contradicted and rejected.

  3808	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3809	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThat which taketh away the reputation of Wisedome, in him that formeth
  3810	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Religion, or addeth to it when it is allready formed, is the enjoyning
  3811	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof a beliefe of contradictories: For both parts of a contradiction
  3812	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcannot possibly be true: and therefore to enjoyne the beliefe of them,
  3813	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis an argument of ignorance; which detects the Author in that; and
  3814	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdiscredits him in all things else he shall propound as from revelation
  3815	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsupernaturall: which revelation a man may indeed have of many things
  3816	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tabove, but of nothing against naturall reason.

  3822	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3823	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThat which taketh away the reputation of Sincerity, is the doing, or
  3824	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsaying of such things, as appeare to be signes, that what they require
  3825	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother men to believe, is not believed by themselves; all which doings,
  3826	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor sayings are therefore called Scandalous, because they be stumbling
  3827	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tblocks, that make men to fall in the way of Religion: as Injustice,
  3828	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCruelty, Prophanesse, Avarice, and Luxury. For who can believe, that he
  3829	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat doth ordinarily such actions, as proceed from any of these
  3830	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trootes, believeth there is any such Invisible Power to be feared, as he
  3831	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\taffrighteth other men withall, for lesser faults?
  3832	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3833	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThat which taketh away the reputation of Love, is the being detected of
  3834	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprivate ends: as when the beliefe they require of others, conduceth or
  3835	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tseemeth to conduce to the acquiring of Dominion, Riches, Dignity, or
  3836	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsecure Pleasure, to themselves onely, or specially. For that which men
  3837	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treap benefit by to themselves, they are thought to do for their own
  3838	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsakes, and not for love of others
  3839	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3840	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3841	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3842	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3843	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWant Of The Testimony Of Miracles
  3844	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3845	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLastly, the testimony that men can render of divine Calling, can be no
  3846	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother, than the operation of Miracles; or true Prophecy, (which also is
  3847	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Miracle;) or extraordinary Felicity. And therefore, to those points
  3848	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Religion, which have been received from them that did such Miracles;
  3849	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose that are added by such, as approve not their Calling by some
  3850	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMiracle, obtain no greater beliefe, than what the Custome, and Lawes of
  3851	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe places, in which they be educated, have wrought into them. For as
  3852	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin naturall things, men of judgement require naturall signes,
  3853	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand arguments; so in supernaturall things, they require signes
  3854	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsupernaturall, (which are Miracles,) before they consent inwardly, and
  3855	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom their hearts.
  3856	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3857	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAll which causes of the weakening of mens faith, do manifestly appear
  3858	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the Examples following. First, we have the Example of the children
  3859	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Israel; who when Moses, that had approved his Calling to them by
  3860	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMiracles, and by the happy conduct of them out of Egypt, was absent but
  3861	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t40 dayes, revolted from the worship of the true God, recommended to
  3862	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem by him; and setting up (Exod.32 1,2) a Golden Calfe for their God,
  3863	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trelapsed into the Idolatry of the Egyptians; from whom they had been
  3864	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tso lately delivered. And again, after Moses, Aaron, Joshua, and that
  3865	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgeneration which had seen the great works of God in Israel, (Judges
  3866	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t2 11) were dead; another generation arose, and served Baal. So that
  3867	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMiracles fayling, Faith also failed.
  3868	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3869	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAgain, when the sons of Samuel, (1 Sam.8.3) being constituted by their
  3870	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfather Judges in Bersabee, received bribes, and judged unjustly, the
  3871	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpeople of Israel refused any more to have God to be their King, in other
  3872	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmanner than he was King of other people; and therefore cryed out to
  3873	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSamuel, to choose them a King after the manner of the Nations. So that
  3874	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJustice Fayling, Faith also fayled: Insomuch, as they deposed their God,
  3875	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom reigning over them.
  3876	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3877	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd whereas in the planting of Christian Religion, the Oracles ceased
  3878	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin all parts of the Roman Empire, and the number of Christians encreased
  3879	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twonderfully every day, and in every place, by the preaching of the
  3880	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tApostles, and Evangelists; a great part of that successe, may reasonably
  3881	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe attributed, to the contempt, into which the Priests of the Gentiles
  3882	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof that time, had brought themselves, by their uncleannesse, avarice,
  3883	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand jugling between Princes. Also the Religion of the Church of Rome,
  3884	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas partly, for the same cause abolished in England, and many other
  3885	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tparts of Christendome; insomuch, as the fayling of Vertue in the
  3886	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPastors, maketh Faith faile in the People: and partly from bringing
  3887	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Philosophy, and doctrine of Aristotle into Religion, by the
  3888	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSchoole-men; from whence there arose so many contradictions, and
  3889	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tabsurdities, as brought the Clergy into a reputation both of Ignorance,
  3890	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand of Fraudulent intention; and enclined people to revolt from them,
  3891	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teither against the will of their own Princes, as in France, and Holland;
  3892	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor with their will, as in England.
  3893	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3894	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLastly, amongst the points by the Church of Rome declared necessary for
  3895	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSalvation, there be so many, manifestly to the advantage of the Pope,
  3896	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand of his spirituall subjects, residing in the territories of other
  3897	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChristian Princes, that were it not for the mutuall emulation of those
  3898	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPrinces, they might without warre, or trouble, exclude all forraign
  3899	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAuthority, as easily as it has been excluded in England. For who is

  3913	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmore sustain it, than any opinion they have of the Sanctity, Wisdome,

  3922	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3923	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAS CONCERNING THEIR FELICITY, AND MISERY
  3924	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3925	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3926	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNature hath made men so equall, in the faculties of body, and mind; as
  3927	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat though there bee found one man sometimes manifestly stronger
  3928	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin body, or of quicker mind then another; yet when all is reckoned
  3929	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttogether, the difference between man, and man, is not so considerable,
  3930	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas that one man can thereupon claim to himselfe any benefit, to which
  3931	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tanother may not pretend, as well as he. For as to the strength of body,
  3932	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe weakest has strength enough to kill the strongest, either by secret
  3933	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmachination, or by confederacy with others, that are in the same danger
  3934	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith himselfe.
  3935	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3936	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd as to the faculties of the mind, (setting aside the arts grounded
  3937	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tupon words, and especially that skill of proceeding upon generall, and
  3938	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinfallible rules, called Science; which very few have, and but in few
  3939	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthings; as being not a native faculty, born with us; nor attained,
  3940	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(as Prudence,) while we look after somewhat els,) I find yet a greater
  3941	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tequality amongst men, than that of strength. For Prudence, is but
  3942	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tExperience; which equall time, equally bestowes on all men, in those
  3943	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthings they equally apply themselves unto. That which may perhaps make
  3944	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch equality incredible, is but a vain conceipt of ones owne wisdome,
  3945	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich almost all men think they have in a greater degree, than the
  3946	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tVulgar; that is, than all men but themselves, and a few others, whom by
  3947	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFame, or for concurring with themselves, they approve. For such is the
  3948	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnature of men, that howsoever they may acknowledge many others to be
  3949	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmore witty, or more eloquent, or more learned; Yet they will hardly
  3950	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbelieve there be many so wise as themselves: For they see their own wit
  3951	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tat hand, and other mens at a distance. But this proveth rather that men
  3952	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare in that point equall, than unequall. For there is not ordinarily a
  3953	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgreater signe of the equall distribution of any thing, than that every
  3954	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman is contented with his share.
  3955	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3956	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3957	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3958	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3959	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFrom Equality Proceeds Diffidence
  3960	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3961	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFrom this equality of ability, ariseth equality of hope in the attaining
  3962	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof our Ends. And therefore if any two men desire the same thing, which
  3963	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tneverthelesse they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies; and in the
  3964	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tway to their End, (which is principally their owne conservation, and
  3965	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsometimes their delectation only,) endeavour to destroy, or subdue one
  3966	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tan other. And from hence it comes to passe, that where an Invader hath
  3967	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tno more to feare, than an other mans single power; if one plant, sow,
  3968	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbuild, or possesse a convenient Seat, others may probably be expected to
  3969	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcome prepared with forces united, to dispossesse, and deprive him, not
  3970	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tonly of the fruit of his labour, but also of his life, or liberty. And
  3971	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Invader again is in the like danger of another.
  3972	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3973	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3974	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3975	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3976	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFrom Diffidence Warre
  3977	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3978	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd from this diffidence of one another, there is no way for any man to
  3979	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsecure himselfe, so reasonable, as Anticipation; that is, by force, or
  3980	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twiles, to master the persons of all men he can, so long, till he see no
  3981	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother power great enough to endanger him: And this is no more than his
  3982	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\town conservation requireth, and is generally allowed. Also because there
  3983	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe some, that taking pleasure in contemplating their own power in
  3984	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe acts of conquest, which they pursue farther than their security
  3985	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trequires; if others, that otherwise would be glad to be at ease within
  3986	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmodest bounds, should not by invasion increase their power, they would
  3987	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot be able, long time, by standing only on their defence, to subsist.
  3988	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd by consequence, such augmentation of dominion over men, being
  3989	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnecessary to a mans conservation, it ought to be allowed him.
  3990	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  3991	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAgaine, men have no pleasure, (but on the contrary a great deale of
  3992	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgriefe) in keeping company, where there is no power able to over-awe
  3993	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem all. For every man looketh that his companion should value him, at
  3994	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe same rate he sets upon himselfe: And upon all signes of contempt,
  3995	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor undervaluing, naturally endeavours, as far as he dares (which amongst
  3996	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem that have no common power, to keep them in quiet, is far enough
  3997	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto make them destroy each other,) to extort a greater value from his
  3998	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontemners, by dommage; and from others, by the example.
  3999	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  4000	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSo that in the nature of man, we find three principall causes of
  4001	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tquarrel. First, Competition; Secondly, Diffidence; Thirdly, Glory.
  4002	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  4003	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe first, maketh men invade for Gain; the second, for Safety; and
  4004	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe third, for Reputation. The first use Violence, to make themselves
  4005	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMasters of other mens persons, wives, children, and cattell; the second,
  4006	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto defend them; the third, for trifles, as a word, a smile, a different
  4007	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\topinion, and any other signe of undervalue, either direct in their
  4008	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPersons, or by reflexion in their Kindred, their Friends, their Nation,
  4009	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir Profession, or their Name.

  4014	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOut Of Civil States,
  4015	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  4016	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThere Is Alwayes Warre Of Every One Against Every One Hereby it is
  4017	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmanifest, that during the time men live without a common Power to keep
  4018	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem all in awe, they are in that condition which is called Warre;
  4019	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand such a warre, as is of every man, against every man. For WARRE,
  4020	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsisteth not in Battell onely, or the act of fighting; but in a tract
  4021	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof time, wherein the Will to contend by Battell is sufficiently known:
  4022	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand therefore the notion of Time, is to be considered in the nature of
  4023	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWarre; as it is in the nature of Weather. For as the nature of Foule
  4024	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tweather, lyeth not in a showre or two of rain; but in an inclination
  4025	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthereto of many dayes together: So the nature of War, consisteth not in
  4026	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tactuall fighting; but in the known disposition thereto, during all the
  4027	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttime there is no assurance to the contrary. All other time is PEACE.

  4031	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  4032	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Incommodites Of Such A War
  4033	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  4034	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhatsoever therefore is consequent to a time of Warre, where every man
  4035	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis Enemy to every man; the same is consequent to the time, wherein men
  4036	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlive without other security, than what their own strength, and their
  4037	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\town invention shall furnish them withall. In such condition, there is
  4038	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tno place for Industry; because the fruit thereof is uncertain; and
  4039	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsequently no Culture of the Earth; no Navigation, nor use of the
  4040	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommodities that may be imported by Sea; no commodious Building; no
  4041	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInstruments of moving, and removing such things as require much force;
  4042	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tno Knowledge of the face of the Earth; no account of Time; no Arts; no
  4043	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLetters; no Society; and which is worst of all, continuall feare, and
  4044	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdanger of violent death; And the life of man, solitary, poore, nasty,
  4045	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbrutish, and short.
  4046	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  4047	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIt may seem strange to some man, that has not well weighed these things;
  4048	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat Nature should thus dissociate, and render men apt to invade,
  4049	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand destroy one another: and he may therefore, not trusting to this
  4050	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInference, made from the Passions, desire perhaps to have the same
  4051	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconfirmed by Experience. Let him therefore consider with himselfe, when
  4052	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttaking a journey, he armes himselfe, and seeks to go well accompanied;
  4053	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhen going to sleep, he locks his dores; when even in his house he
  4054	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlocks his chests; and this when he knows there bee Lawes, and publike
  4055	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOfficers, armed, to revenge all injuries shall bee done him; what
  4056	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\topinion he has of his fellow subjects, when he rides armed; of his
  4057	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfellow Citizens, when he locks his dores; and of his children, and
  4058	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tservants, when he locks his chests. Does he not there as much accuse
  4059	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmankind by his actions, as I do by my words? But neither of us accuse
  4060	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmans nature in it. The Desires, and other Passions of man, are in
  4061	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthemselves no Sin. No more are the Actions, that proceed from those
  4062	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPassions, till they know a Law that forbids them; which till Lawes be
  4063	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmade they cannot know: nor can any Law be made, till they have agreed
  4064	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tupon the Person that shall make it.
  4065	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  4066	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIt may peradventure be thought, there was never such a time, nor
  4067	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcondition of warre as this; and I believe it was never generally so,
  4068	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tover all the world: but there are many places, where they live so now.
  4069	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor the savage people in many places of America, except the government
  4070	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof small Families, the concord whereof dependeth on naturall lust, have
  4071	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tno government at all; and live at this day in that brutish manner, as
  4072	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tI said before. Howsoever, it may be perceived what manner of life there
  4073	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twould be, where there were no common Power to feare; by the manner of
  4074	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlife, which men that have formerly lived under a peacefull government,
  4075	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tuse to degenerate into, in a civill Warre.
  4076	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  4077	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut though there had never been any time, wherein particular men were in
  4078	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta condition of warre one against another; yet in all times, Kings, and
  4079	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpersons of Soveraigne authority, because of their Independency, are
  4080	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin continuall jealousies, and in the state and posture of Gladiators;
  4081	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thaving their weapons pointing, and their eyes fixed on one another;
  4082	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat is, their Forts, Garrisons, and Guns upon the Frontiers of their
  4083	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKingdomes; and continuall Spyes upon their neighbours; which is a
  4084	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tposture of War. But because they uphold thereby, the Industry of their
  4085	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSubjects; there does not follow from it, that misery, which accompanies
  4086	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Liberty of particular men.

  4091	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn Such A Warre, Nothing Is Unjust
  4092	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  4093	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo this warre of every man against every man, this also is consequent;
  4094	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat nothing can be Unjust. The notions of Right and Wrong, Justice and
  4095	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInjustice have there no place. Where there is no common Power, there is
  4096	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tno Law: where no Law, no Injustice. Force, and Fraud, are in warre the
  4097	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttwo Cardinall vertues. Justice, and Injustice are none of the Faculties
  4098	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tneither of the Body, nor Mind. If they were, they might be in a man that
  4099	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere alone in the world, as well as his Senses, and Passions. They
  4100	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare Qualities, that relate to men in Society, not in Solitude. It is
  4101	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsequent also to the same condition, that there be no Propriety, no
  4102	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDominion, no Mine and Thine distinct; but onely that to be every mans
  4103	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat he can get; and for so long, as he can keep it. And thus much
  4104	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor the ill condition, which man by meer Nature is actually placed in;
  4105	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthough with a possibility to come out of it, consisting partly in the
  4106	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPassions, partly in his Reason.

  4114	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch things as are necessary to commodious living; and a Hope by their
  4115	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIndustry to obtain them. And Reason suggesteth convenient Articles of

  4165	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNaturally Every Man Has Right To Everything
  4166	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  4167	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd because the condition of Man, (as hath been declared in the
  4168	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprecedent Chapter) is a condition of Warre of every one against every
  4169	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tone; in which case every one is governed by his own Reason; and there
  4170	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis nothing he can make use of, that may not be a help unto him, in
  4171	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpreserving his life against his enemyes; It followeth, that in such a
  4172	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcondition, every man has a Right to every thing; even to one anothers
  4173	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbody. And therefore, as long as this naturall Right of every man to
  4174	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevery thing endureth, there can be no security to any man, (how strong
  4175	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor wise soever he be,) of living out the time, which Nature ordinarily
  4176	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talloweth men to live.

  4181	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Fundamental Law Of Nature
  4182	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  4183	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd consequently it is a precept, or generall rule of Reason, "That
  4184	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevery man, ought to endeavour Peace, as farre as he has hope of
  4185	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobtaining it; and when he cannot obtain it, that he may seek, and use,
  4186	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall helps, and advantages of Warre." The first branch, of which Rule,
  4187	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontaineth the first, and Fundamentall Law of Nature; which is, "To seek
  4188	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPeace, and follow it." The Second, the summe of the Right of Nature;
  4189	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich is, "By all means we can, to defend our selves."

  4194	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Second Law Of Nature
  4195	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  4196	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFrom this Fundamentall Law of Nature, by which men are commanded to
  4197	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tendeavour Peace, is derived this second Law; "That a man be willing,
  4198	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhen others are so too, as farre-forth, as for Peace, and defence of
  4199	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thimselfe he shall think it necessary, to lay down this right to all
  4200	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthings; and be contented with so much liberty against other men, as
  4201	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the would allow other men against himselfe." For as long as every man
  4202	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tholdeth this Right, of doing any thing he liketh; so long are all men in
  4203	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe condition of Warre. But if other men will not lay down their Right,
  4204	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas well as he; then there is no Reason for any one, to devest himselfe
  4205	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof his: For that were to expose himselfe to Prey, (which no man is bound
  4206	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto) rather than to dispose himselfe to Peace. This is that Law of the
  4207	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGospell; "Whatsoever you require that others should do to you, that do
  4208	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tye to them." And that Law of all men, "Quod tibi feiri non vis, alteri

  4214	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhat it is to lay down a Right
  4215	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  4216	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo Lay Downe a mans Right to any thing, is to Devest himselfe of the
  4217	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLiberty, of hindring another of the benefit of his own Right to the
  4218	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsame. For he that renounceth, or passeth away his Right, giveth not to
  4219	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tany other man a Right which he had not before; because there is nothing
  4220	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto which every man had not Right by Nature: but onely standeth out of
  4221	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this way, that he may enjoy his own originall Right, without hindrance
  4222	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom him; not without hindrance from another. So that the effect which
  4223	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tredoundeth to one man, by another mans defect of Right, is but so much
  4224	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdiminution of impediments to the use of his own Right originall.

  4230	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  4231	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRight is layd aside, either by simply Renouncing it; or by Transferring
  4232	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit to another. By Simply RENOUNCING; when he cares not to whom the
  4233	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbenefit thereof redoundeth. By TRANSFERRING; when he intendeth the
  4234	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbenefit thereof to some certain person, or persons. And when a man hath
  4235	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin either manner abandoned, or granted away his Right; then is he said
  4236	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto be OBLIGED, or BOUND, not to hinder those, to whom such Right is
  4237	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgranted, or abandoned, from the benefit of it: and that he Ought, and it
  4238	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this DUTY, not to make voyd that voluntary act of his own: and that such
  4239	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thindrance is INJUSTICE, and INJURY, as being Sine Jure; the Right being
  4240	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbefore renounced, or transferred. So that Injury, or Injustice, in
  4241	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe controversies of the world, is somewhat like to that, which in the
  4242	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdisputations of Scholers is called Absurdity. For as it is there called
  4243	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tan Absurdity, to contradict what one maintained in the Beginning: so in
  4244	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe world, it is called Injustice, and Injury, voluntarily to undo that,
  4245	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich from the beginning he had voluntarily done. The way by which a man
  4246	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teither simply Renounceth, or Transferreth his Right, is a Declaration,
  4247	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor Signification, by some voluntary and sufficient signe, or signes,
  4248	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat he doth so Renounce, or Transferre; or hath so Renounced, or
  4249	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTransferred the same, to him that accepteth it. And these Signes are
  4250	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teither Words onely, or Actions onely; or (as it happeneth most often)
  4251	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tboth Words and Actions. And the same are the BONDS, by which men are
  4252	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbound, and obliged: Bonds, that have their strength, not from their own
  4253	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNature, (for nothing is more easily broken then a mans word,) but from
  4254	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFeare of some evill consequence upon the rupture.

  4259	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNot All Rights Are Alienable
  4260	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  4261	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhensoever a man Transferreth his Right, or Renounceth it; it is either
  4262	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin consideration of some Right reciprocally transferred to himselfe; or
  4263	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor some other good he hopeth for thereby. For it is a voluntary act:
  4264	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand of the voluntary acts of every man, the object is some Good To
  4265	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHimselfe. And therefore there be some Rights, which no man can be
  4266	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunderstood by any words, or other signes, to have abandoned, or
  4267	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttransferred. As first a man cannot lay down the right of resisting them,
  4268	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat assault him by force, to take away his life; because he cannot be
  4269	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunderstood to ayme thereby, at any Good to himselfe. The same may be
  4270	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsayd of Wounds, and Chayns, and Imprisonment; both because there is
  4271	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tno benefit consequent to such patience; as there is to the patience of
  4272	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuffering another to be wounded, or imprisoned: as also because a man
  4273	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcannot tell, when he seeth men proceed against him by violence, whether
  4274	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey intend his death or not. And lastly the motive, and end for which
  4275	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis renouncing, and transferring or Right is introduced, is nothing
  4276	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\telse but the security of a mans person, in his life, and in the means of
  4277	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tso preserving life, as not to be weary of it. And therefore if a man by
  4278	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twords, or other signes, seem to despoyle himselfe of the End, for which
  4279	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose signes were intended; he is not to be understood as if he meant
  4280	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit, or that it was his will; but that he was ignorant of how such words
  4281	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand actions were to be interpreted.

  4290	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThere is difference, between transferring of Right to the Thing; and
  4291	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttransferring, or tradition, that is, delivery of the Thing it selfe. For
  4292	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Thing may be delivered together with the Translation of the Right;

  4304	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this part, is called PACT, or COVENANT: Or both parts may contract now,

  4329	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare either of the time Present, or Past; as, I Give, I Grant, I Have
  4330	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGiven, I Have Granted, I Will That This Be Yours: Or of the future;
  4331	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas, I Will Give, I Will Grant; which words of the future, are called

  4348	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFree Gift Passeth By Words Of The Present Or Past
  4349	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  4350	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWords alone, if they be of the time to come, and contain a bare promise,
  4351	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare an insufficient signe of a Free-gift and therefore not obligatory.
  4352	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor if they be of the time to Come, as, To Morrow I Will Give, they
  4353	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare a signe I have not given yet, and consequently that my right is not
  4354	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttransferred, but remaineth till I transferre it by some other Act. But
  4355	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tif the words be of the time Present, or Past, as, "I have given, or do
  4356	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgive to be delivered to morrow," then is my to morrows Right given away
  4357	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto day; and that by the vertue of the words, though there were no
  4358	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother argument of my will. And there is a great difference in the
  4359	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsignification of these words, Volos Hoc Tuum Esse Cras, and Cros Dabo;
  4360	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat is between "I will that this be thine to morrow," and, "I will
  4361	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgive it to thee to morrow:" For the word I Will, in the former manner
  4362	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof speech, signifies an act of the will Present; but in the later, it
  4363	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsignifies a promise of an act of the will to Come: and therefore the
  4364	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tformer words, being of the Present, transferre a future right; the
  4365	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlater, that be of the Future, transferre nothing. But if there be other
  4366	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsignes of the Will to transferre a Right, besides Words; then, though
  4367	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe gift be Free, yet may the Right be understood to passe by words of
  4368	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe future: as if a man propound a Prize to him that comes first to the
  4369	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tend of a race, The gift is Free; and though the words be of the
  4370	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFuture, yet the Right passeth: for if he would not have his words so be
  4371	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunderstood, he should not have let them runne.
  4372	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  4373	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSignes Of Contract Are Words Both Of The Past, Present, and Future In
  4374	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tContracts, the right passeth, not onely where the words are of the time
  4375	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPresent, or Past; but also where they are of the Future; because all
  4376	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tContract is mutuall translation, or change of Right; and therefore he
  4377	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat promiseth onely, because he hath already received the benefit for
  4378	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich he promiseth, is to be understood as if he intended the Right
  4379	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshould passe: for unlesse he had been content to have his words so
  4380	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunderstood, the other would not have performed his part first. And
  4381	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor that cause, in buying, and selling, and other acts of Contract, A
  4382	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPromise is equivalent to a Covenant; and therefore obligatory.

  4387	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMerit What
  4388	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  4389	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHe that performeth first in the case of a Contract, is said to MERIT
  4390	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat which he is to receive by the performance of the other; and he hath
  4391	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit as Due. Also when a Prize is propounded to many, which is to be given
  4392	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto him onely that winneth; or mony is thrown amongst many, to be enjoyed
  4393	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby them that catch it; though this be a Free Gift; yet so to Win, or
  4394	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tso to Catch, is to Merit, and to have it as DUE. For the Right is
  4395	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttransferred in the Propounding of the Prize, and in throwing down the
  4396	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmony; though it be not determined to whom, but by the Event of the
  4397	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontention. But there is between these two sorts of Merit, this
  4398	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdifference, that In Contract, I Merit by vertue of my own power, and the
  4399	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tContractors need; but in this case of Free Gift, I am enabled to
  4400	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMerit onely by the benignity of the Giver; In Contract, I merit at The
  4401	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tContractors hand that hee should depart with his right; In this case of
  4402	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgift, I Merit not that the giver should part with his right; but that
  4403	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhen he has parted with it, it should be mine, rather than anothers.
  4404	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd this I think to be the meaning of that distinction of the Schooles,
  4405	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbetween Meritum Congrui, and Meritum Condigni. For God Almighty, having
  4406	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpromised Paradise to those men (hoodwinkt with carnall desires,) that
  4407	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcan walk through this world according to the Precepts, and Limits
  4408	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprescribed by him; they say, he that shall so walk, shall Merit Paradise
  4409	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEx Congruo. But because no man can demand a right to it, by his own
  4410	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRighteousnesse, or any other power in himselfe, but by the Free Grace of
  4411	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod onely; they say, no man can Merit Paradise Ex Condigno. This I say,
  4412	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tI think is the meaning of that distinction; but because Disputers do not
  4413	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagree upon the signification of their own termes of Art, longer than it
  4414	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tserves their turn; I will not affirme any thing of their meaning:
  4415	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tonely this I say; when a gift is given indefinitely, as a prize to be
  4416	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontended for, he that winneth Meriteth, and may claime the Prize as
  4417	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDue.

  4427	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tany reasonable suspition, it is Voyd; But if there be a common Power set
  4428	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tover them bothe, with right and force sufficient to compell performance;
  4429	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit is not Voyd. For he that performeth first, has no assurance the other
  4430	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twill performe after; because the bonds of words are too weak to bridle
  4431	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmens ambition, avarice, anger, and other Passions, without the feare of
  4432	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsome coerceive Power; which in the condition of meer Nature, where all
  4433	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen are equall, and judges of the justnesse of their own fears cannot
  4434	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpossibly be supposed. And therefore he which performeth first, does
  4435	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut betray himselfe to his enemy; contrary to the Right (he can never
  4436	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tabandon) of defending his life, and means of living.
  4437	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  4438	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut in a civill estate, where there is a Power set up to constrain
  4439	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose that would otherwise violate their faith, that feare is no more
  4440	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treasonable; and for that cause, he which by the Covenant is to perform
  4441	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfirst, is obliged so to do.
  4442	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  4443	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe cause of Feare, which maketh such a Covenant invalid, must be

  4445	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor other signe of the Will not to performe; else it cannot make the

  4492	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsay an act, and the last act, of deliberation;) and is therefore alwayes

  4517	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  4518	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCovenants entred into by fear, in the condition of meer Nature, are
  4519	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobligatory. For example, if I Covenant to pay a ransome, or service for
  4520	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmy life, to an enemy; I am bound by it. For it is a Contract, wherein
  4521	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tone receiveth the benefit of life; the other is to receive mony,
  4522	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor service for it; and consequently, where no other Law (as in the
  4523	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcondition, of meer Nature) forbiddeth the performance, the Covenant
  4524	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis valid. Therefore Prisoners of warre, if trusted with the payment of
  4525	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir Ransome, are obliged to pay it; And if a weaker Prince, make a
  4526	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdisadvantageous peace with a stronger, for feare; he is bound to keep
  4527	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit; unlesse (as hath been sayd before) there ariseth some new, and just
  4528	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcause of feare, to renew the war. And even in Common-wealths, if I be
  4529	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tforced to redeem my selfe from a Theefe by promising him mony, I am
  4530	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbound to pay it, till the Civill Law discharge me. For whatsoever I may
  4531	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlawfully do without Obligation, the same I may lawfully Covenant to do

  4538	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  4539	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tA former Covenant, makes voyd a later. For a man that hath passed away
  4540	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this Right to one man to day, hath it not to passe to morrow to another:
  4541	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand therefore the later promise passeth no Right, but is null.

  4547	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  4548	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tA Covenant not to defend my selfe from force, by force, is alwayes voyd.
  4549	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor (as I have shewed before) no man can transferre, or lay down his
  4550	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRight to save himselfe from Death, Wounds, and Imprisonment, (the
  4551	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tavoyding whereof is the onely End of laying down any Right,)
  4552	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand therefore the promise of not resisting force, in no Covenant
  4553	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttransferreth any right; nor is obliging. For though a man may Covenant
  4554	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthus, "Unlesse I do so, or so, kill me;" he cannot Covenant thus "Unless
  4555	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tI do so, or so, I will not resist you, when you come to kill me." For
  4556	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman by nature chooseth the lesser evill, which is danger of death in
  4557	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tresisting; rather than the greater, which is certain and present death
  4558	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin not resisting. And this is granted to be true by all men, in
  4559	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat they lead Criminals to Execution, and Prison, with armed men,
  4560	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnotwithstanding that such Criminals have consented to the Law, by which

  4567	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  4568	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tA Covenant to accuse ones Selfe, without assurance of pardon, is
  4569	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlikewise invalide. For in the condition of Nature, where every man is
  4570	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJudge, there is no place for Accusation: and in the Civill State, the
  4571	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAccusation is followed with Punishment; which being Force, a man is
  4572	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot obliged not to resist. The same is also true, of the Accusation of
  4573	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose, by whose Condemnation a man falls into misery; as of a Father,
  4574	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWife, or Benefactor. For the Testimony of such an Accuser, if it be not
  4575	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twillingly given, is praesumed to be corrupted by Nature; and therefore
  4576	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot to be received: and where a mans Testimony is not to be credited,
  4577	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this not bound to give it. Also Accusations upon Torture, are not to
  4578	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe reputed as Testimonies. For Torture is to be used but as means of
  4579	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconjecture, and light, in the further examination, and search of truth;
  4580	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand what is in that case confessed, tendeth to the ease of him that is
  4581	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTortured; not to the informing of the Torturers: and therefore ought
  4582	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot to have the credit of a sufficient Testimony: for whether he deliver
  4583	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thimselfe by true, or false Accusation, he does it by the Right of
  4584	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpreserving his own life.

  4593	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttwo imaginable helps to strengthen it. And those are either a Feare
  4594	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the consequence of breaking their word; or a Glory, or Pride in
  4595	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tappearing not to need to breake it. This later is a Generosity too
  4596	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trarely found to be presumed on, especially in the pursuers of Wealth,
  4597	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommand, or sensuall Pleasure; which are the greatest part of Mankind.
  4598	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Passion to be reckoned upon, is Fear; whereof there be two very
  4599	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgenerall Objects: one, the Power of Spirits Invisible; the other, the
  4600	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPower of those men they shall therein Offend. Of these two, though the
  4601	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tformer be the greater Power, yet the feare of the later is commonly
  4602	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe greater Feare. The Feare of the former is in every man, his own
  4603	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tReligion: which hath place in the nature of man before Civill Society.
  4604	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe later hath not so; at least not place enough, to keep men to their
  4605	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpromises; because in the condition of meer Nature, the inequality of
  4606	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPower is not discerned, but by the event of Battell. So that before the
  4607	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttime of Civill Society, or in the interruption thereof by Warre, there
  4608	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis nothing can strengthen a Covenant of Peace agreed on, against the
  4609	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttemptations of Avarice, Ambition, Lust, or other strong desire, but the
  4610	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfeare of that Invisible Power, which they every one Worship as God; and
  4611	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFeare as a Revenger of their perfidy. All therefore that can be done
  4612	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbetween two men not subject to Civill Power, is to put one another
  4613	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto swear by the God he feareth: Which Swearing or OATH, is a Forme Of
  4614	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSpeech, Added To A Promise; By Which He That Promiseth, Signifieth, That
  4615	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tUnlesse He Performe, He Renounceth The Mercy Of His God, Or Calleth To
  4616	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHim For Vengeance On Himselfe. Such was the Heathen Forme, "Let Jupiter
  4617	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tkill me else, as I kill this Beast." So is our Forme, "I shall do thus,
  4618	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand thus, so help me God." And this, with the Rites and Ceremonies,
  4619	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich every one useth in his own Religion, that the feare of breaking
  4620	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfaith might be the greater.

  4626	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  4627	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBy this it appears, that an Oath taken according to any other Forme, or
  4628	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRite, then his, that sweareth, is in vain; and no Oath: And there is no
  4629	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSwearing by any thing which the Swearer thinks not God. For though men
  4630	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave sometimes used to swear by their Kings, for feare, or flattery; yet
  4631	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey would have it thereby understood, they attributed to them Divine
  4632	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thonour. And that Swearing unnecessarily by God, is but prophaning of his
  4633	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tname: and Swearing by other things, as men do in common discourse, is
  4634	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot Swearing, but an impious Custome, gotten by too much vehemence of

  4658	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere followeth a Third; which is this, That Men Performe Their
  4659	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCovenants Made: without which, Covenants are in vain, and but Empty
  4660	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twords; and the Right of all men to all things remaining, wee are still

  4667	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  4668	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd in this law of Nature, consisteth the Fountain and Originall of
  4669	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJUSTICE. For where no Covenant hath preceded, there hath no Right been
  4670	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttransferred, and every man has right to every thing; and consequently,
  4671	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tno action can be Unjust. But when a Covenant is made, then to break it
  4672	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis Unjust: And the definition of INJUSTICE, is no other than The Not
  4673	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPerformance Of Covenant. And whatsoever is not Unjust, is Just.
  4674	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  4675	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJustice And Propriety Begin With The Constitution of Common-wealth
  4676	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut because Covenants of mutuall trust, where there is a feare of not
  4677	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tperformance on either part, (as hath been said in the former Chapter,)
  4678	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare invalid; though the Originall of Justice be the making of Covenants;
  4679	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tyet Injustice actually there can be none, till the cause of such feare
  4680	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe taken away; which while men are in the naturall condition of Warre,
  4681	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcannot be done. Therefore before the names of Just, and Unjust can have
  4682	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tplace, there must be some coercive Power, to compell men equally to
  4683	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe performance of their Covenants, by the terrour of some punishment,
  4684	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgreater than the benefit they expect by the breach of their Covenant;
  4685	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand to make good that Propriety, which by mutuall Contract men acquire,
  4686	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin recompence of the universall Right they abandon: and such power there
  4687	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis none before the erection of a Common-wealth. And this is also to be
  4688	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgathered out of the ordinary definition of Justice in the Schooles: For
  4689	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey say, that "Justice is the constant Will of giving to every man his
  4690	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\town." And therefore where there is no Own, that is, no Propriety, there
  4691	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis no Injustice; and where there is no coerceive Power erected, that is,
  4692	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhere there is no Common-wealth, there is no Propriety; all men having
  4693	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRight to all things: Therefore where there is no Common-wealth, there
  4694	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnothing is Unjust. So that the nature of Justice, consisteth in keeping
  4695	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof valid Covenants: but the Validity of Covenants begins not but with
  4696	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Constitution of a Civill Power, sufficient to compell men to keep
  4697	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem: And then it is also that Propriety begins.

  4703	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  4704	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Foole hath sayd in his heart, there is no such thing as Justice;
  4705	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand sometimes also with his tongue; seriously alleaging, that every mans
  4706	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconservation, and contentment, being committed to his own care, there
  4707	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcould be no reason, why every man might not do what he thought conduced
  4708	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthereunto; and therefore also to make, or not make; keep, or not keep
  4709	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCovenants, was not against Reason, when it conduced to ones benefit.
  4710	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHe does not therein deny, that there be Covenants; and that they are
  4711	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsometimes broken, sometimes kept; and that such breach of them may
  4712	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe called Injustice, and the observance of them Justice: but he
  4713	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tquestioneth, whether Injustice, taking away the feare of God, (for the
  4714	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsame Foole hath said in his heart there is no God,) may not sometimes
  4715	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tstand with that Reason, which dictateth to every man his own good; and
  4716	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tparticularly then, when it conduceth to such a benefit, as shall put a
  4717	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman in a condition, to neglect not onely the dispraise, and revilings,
  4718	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut also the power of other men. The Kingdome of God is gotten by
  4719	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tviolence; but what if it could be gotten by unjust violence? were it
  4720	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagainst Reason so to get it, when it is impossible to receive hurt by
  4721	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit? and if it be not against Reason, it is not against Justice; or else
  4722	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJustice is not to be approved for good. From such reasoning as this,
  4723	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSuccesfull wickednesse hath obtained the Name of Vertue; and some that
  4724	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin all other things have disallowed the violation of Faith; yet have
  4725	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tallowed it, when it is for the getting of a Kingdome. And the Heathen
  4726	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat believed, that Saturn was deposed by his son Jupiter, believed
  4727	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tneverthelesse the same Jupiter to be the avenger of Injustice: Somewhat
  4728	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlike to a piece of Law in Cokes Commentaries on Litleton; where he
  4729	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsayes, If the right Heire of the Crown be attainted of Treason; yet the
  4730	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCrown shall descend to him, and Eo Instante the Atteynder be voyd; From
  4731	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich instances a man will be very prone to inferre; that when the Heire
  4732	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tapparent of a Kingdome, shall kill him that is in possession, though his
  4733	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfather; you may call it Injustice, or by what other name you will; yet
  4734	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit can never be against Reason, seeing all the voluntary actions of
  4735	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen tend to the benefit of themselves; and those actions are most
  4736	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tReasonable, that conduce most to their ends. This specious reasoning is
  4737	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnevertheless false.
  4738	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  4739	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor the question is not of promises mutuall, where there is no security
  4740	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof performance on either side; as when there is no Civill Power erected
  4741	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tover the parties promising; for such promises are no Covenants: But
  4742	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teither where one of the parties has performed already; or where there
  4743	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis a Power to make him performe; there is the question whether it be
  4744	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagainst reason, that is, against the benefit of the other to performe,
  4745	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor not. And I say it is not against reason. For the manifestation
  4746	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhereof, we are to consider; First, that when a man doth a thing, which
  4747	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnotwithstanding any thing can be foreseen, and reckoned on, tendeth to
  4748	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this own destruction, howsoever some accident which he could not expect,
  4749	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tarriving may turne it to his benefit; yet such events do not make it
  4750	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treasonably or wisely done. Secondly, that in a condition of Warre,
  4751	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twherein every man to every man, for want of a common Power to keep them
  4752	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall in awe, is an Enemy, there is no man can hope by his own strength,
  4753	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor wit, to defend himselfe from destruction, without the help
  4754	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Confederates; where every one expects the same defence by the
  4755	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConfederation, that any one else does: and therefore he which declares
  4756	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the thinks it reason to deceive those that help him, can in reason expect
  4757	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tno other means of safety, than what can be had from his own single
  4758	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPower. He therefore that breaketh his Covenant, and consequently
  4759	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdeclareth that he thinks he may with reason do so, cannot be received
  4760	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinto any Society, that unite themselves for Peace and defence, but
  4761	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby the errour of them that receive him; nor when he is received, be
  4762	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tretayned in it, without seeing the danger of their errour; which errours
  4763	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta man cannot reasonably reckon upon as the means of his security; and
  4764	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore if he be left, or cast out of Society, he perisheth; and if he
  4765	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlive in Society, it is by the errours of other men, which he could not
  4766	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tforesee, nor reckon upon; and consequently against the reason of his
  4767	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpreservation; and so, as all men that contribute not to his destruction,
  4768	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tforbear him onely out of ignorance of what is good for themselves.
  4769	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  4770	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAs for the Instance of gaining the secure and perpetuall felicity of
  4771	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHeaven, by any way; it is frivolous: there being but one way imaginable;
  4772	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand that is not breaking, but keeping of Covenant.
  4773	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  4774	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd for the other Instance of attaining Soveraignty by Rebellion; it is
  4775	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmanifest, that though the event follow, yet because it cannot reasonably
  4776	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe expected, but rather the contrary; and because by gaining it so,
  4777	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tothers are taught to gain the same in like manner, the attempt thereof
  4778	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis against reason. Justice therefore, that is to say, Keeping of
  4779	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCovenant, is a Rule of Reason, by which we are forbidden to do any thing
  4780	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdestructive to our life; and consequently a Law of Nature.
  4781	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  4782	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThere be some that proceed further; and will not have the Law of Nature,
  4783	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto be those Rules which conduce to the preservation of mans life on
  4784	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tearth; but to the attaining of an eternall felicity after death; to
  4785	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich they think the breach of Covenant may conduce; and consequently
  4786	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe just and reasonable; (such are they that think it a work of merit
  4787	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto kill, or depose, or rebell against, the Soveraigne Power constituted
  4788	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tover them by their own consent.) But because there is no naturall
  4789	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tknowledge of mans estate after death; much lesse of the reward that is
  4790	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthen to be given to breach of Faith; but onely a beliefe grounded upon
  4791	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother mens saying, that they know it supernaturally, or that they know
  4792	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose, that knew them, that knew others, that knew it supernaturally;
  4793	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBreach of Faith cannot be called a Precept of Reason, or Nature.

  4800	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOthers, that allow for a Law of Nature, the keeping of Faith, do
  4801	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tneverthelesse make exception of certain persons; as Heretiques, and
  4802	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch as use not to performe their Covenant to others: And this also is
  4803	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagainst reason. For if any fault of a man, be sufficient to discharge
  4804	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tour Covenant made; the same ought in reason to have been sufficient to
  4805	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave hindred the making of it.

  4810	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJustice Of Men, And Justice Of Actions What
  4811	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  4812	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe names of Just, and Unjust, when they are attributed to Men, signifie
  4813	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tone thing; and when they are attributed to Actions, another. When they
  4814	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare attributed to Men, they signifie Conformity, or Inconformity of
  4815	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tManners, to Reason. But when they are attributed to Actions, they
  4816	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsignifie the Conformity, or Inconformity to Reason, not of Manners, or
  4817	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmanner of life, but of particular Actions. A Just man therefore, is he
  4818	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat taketh all the care he can, that his Actions may be all Just: and
  4819	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tan Unjust man, is he that neglecteth it. And such men are more often
  4820	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin our Language stiled by the names of Righteous, and Unrighteous; then
  4821	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJust, and Unjust; though the meaning be the same. Therefore a Righteous
  4822	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman, does not lose that Title, by one, or a few unjust Actions, that
  4823	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tproceed from sudden Passion, or mistake of Things, or Persons: nor does
  4824	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tan Unrighteous man, lose his character, for such Actions, as he does,
  4825	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof forbeares to do, for feare: because his Will is not framed by the
  4826	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJustice, but by the apparant benefit of what he is to do. That which
  4827	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgives to humane Actions the relish of Justice, is a certain Noblenesse
  4828	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor Gallantnesse of courage, (rarely found,) by which a man scorns to
  4829	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe beholding for the contentment of his life, to fraud, or breach of
  4830	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpromise. This Justice of the Manners, is that which is meant, where
  4831	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJustice is called a Vertue; and Injustice a Vice.
  4832	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  4833	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut the Justice of Actions denominates men, not Just, but Guiltlesse;
  4834	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand the Injustice of the same, (which is also called Injury,) gives them
  4835	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut the name of Guilty.
  4836	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  4837	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t

  4840	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJustice Of Manners, And Justice Of Actions
  4841	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  4842	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAgain, the Injustice of Manners, is the disposition, or aptitude to
  4843	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdo Injurie; and is Injustice before it proceed to Act; and without
  4844	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsupposing any individuall person injured. But the Injustice of an
  4845	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAction, (that is to say Injury,) supposeth an individuall person
  4846	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInjured; namely him, to whom the Covenant was made: And therefore many
  4847	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttimes the injury is received by one man, when the dammage redoundeth
  4848	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto another. As when The Master commandeth his servant to give mony to a
  4849	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tstranger; if it be not done, the Injury is done to the Master, whom
  4850	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the had before Covenanted to obey; but the dammage redoundeth to the
  4851	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tstranger, to whom he had no Obligation; and therefore could not Injure
  4852	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim. And so also in Common-wealths, private men may remit to one another
  4853	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir debts; but not robberies or other violences, whereby they are
  4854	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tendammaged; because the detaining of Debt, is an Injury to themselves;
  4855	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut Robbery and Violence, are Injuries to the Person of the
  4856	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth.

  4861	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNothing Done To A Man, By His Own Consent Can Be Injury
  4862	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  4863	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhatsoever is done to a man, conformable to his own Will signified to
  4864	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe doer, is no Injury to him. For if he that doeth it, hath not passed
  4865	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\taway his originall right to do what he please, by some Antecedent
  4866	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCovenant, there is no breach of Covenant; and therefore no Injury done
  4867	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim. And if he have; then his Will to have it done being signified, is a
  4868	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trelease of that Covenant; and so again there is no Injury done him.

  4873	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJustice Commutative, And Distributive
  4874	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  4875	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJustice of Actions, is by Writers divided into Commutative, and
  4876	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDistributive; and the former they say consisteth in proportion
  4877	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tArithmeticall; the later in proportion Geometricall. Commutative
  4878	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore, they place in the equality of value of the things contracted
  4879	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor; And Distributive, in the distribution of equall benefit, to men of
  4880	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tequall merit. As if it were Injustice to sell dearer than we buy; or to
  4881	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgive more to a man than he merits. The value of all things contracted
  4882	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor, is measured by the Appetite of the Contractors: and therefore the
  4883	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tjust value, is that which they be contented to give. And Merit (besides
  4884	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat which is by Covenant, where the performance on one part, meriteth
  4885	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe performance of the other part, and falls under Justice Commutative,
  4886	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot Distributive,) is not due by Justice; but is rewarded of Grace
  4887	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tonely. And therefore this distinction, in the sense wherein it useth to
  4888	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe expounded, is not right. To speak properly, Commutative Justice,
  4889	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis the Justice of a Contractor; that is, a Performance of Covenant,
  4890	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin Buying, and Selling; Hiring, and Letting to Hire; Lending, and
  4891	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBorrowing; Exchanging, Bartering, and other acts of Contract.
  4892	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  4893	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd Distributive Justice, the Justice of an Arbitrator; that is to say,
  4894	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe act of defining what is Just. Wherein, (being trusted by them that
  4895	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmake him Arbitrator,) if he performe his Trust, he is said to distribute
  4896	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto every man his own: and his is indeed Just Distribution, and may
  4897	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe called (though improperly) Distributive Justice; but more properly
  4898	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEquity; which also is a Law of Nature, as shall be shewn in due place.

  4906	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ton Antecedent Grace; that is to say, Antecedent Free-gift: and is the
  4907	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfourth Law of Nature; which may be conceived in this Forme, "That a man

  4909	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich giveth it, have no reasonable cause to repent him of his good
  4910	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twill." For no man giveth, but with intention of Good to himselfe;
  4911	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbecause Gift is Voluntary; and of all Voluntary Acts, the Object is to
  4912	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevery man his own Good; of which if men see they shall be frustrated,
  4913	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere will be no beginning of benevolence, or trust; nor consequently of

  4916	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe first and Fundamentall Law of Nature, which commandeth men to Seek
  4917	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPeace. The breach of this Law, is called Ingratitude; and hath the same

  4926	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman strive to accommodate himselfe to the rest." For the understanding
  4927	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhereof, we may consider, that there is in mens aptnesse to Society;
  4928	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta diversity of Nature, rising from their diversity of Affections; not
  4929	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunlike to that we see in stones brought together for building of an
  4930	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAedifice. For as that stone which by the asperity, and irregularity of
  4931	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFigure, takes more room from others, than it selfe fills; and for
  4932	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe hardnesse, cannot be easily made plain, and thereby hindereth the
  4933	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbuilding, is by the builders cast away as unprofitable, and troublesome:
  4934	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tso also, a man that by asperity of Nature, will strive to retain those
  4935	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthings which to himselfe are superfluous, and to others necessary; and
  4936	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor the stubbornness of his Passions, cannot be corrected, is to be
  4937	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tleft, or cast out of Society, as combersome thereunto. For seeing every
  4938	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman, not onely by Right, but also by necessity of Nature, is supposed
  4939	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto endeavour all he can, to obtain that which is necessary for his
  4940	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconservation; He that shall oppose himselfe against it, for things
  4941	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuperfluous, is guilty of the warre that thereupon is to follow; and
  4942	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore doth that, which is contrary to the fundamentall Law of
  4943	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNature, which commandeth To Seek Peace. The observers of this Law,
  4944	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmay be called SOCIABLE, (the Latines call them Commodi;) The contrary,

  4950	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Sixth, Facility To Pardon
  4951	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  4952	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tA sixth Law of Nature is this, "That upon caution of the Future time,
  4953	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta man ought to pardon the offences past of them that repenting, desire
  4954	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit." For PARDON, is nothing but granting of Peace; which though granted
  4955	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto them that persevere in their hostility, be not Peace, but Feare; yet
  4956	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot granted to them that give caution of the Future time, is signe of an
  4957	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\taversion to Peace; and therefore contrary to the Law of Nature.

  4962	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Seventh, That In Revenges, Men Respect Onely The Future Good
  4963	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  4964	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tA seventh is, " That in Revenges, (that is, retribution of evil for
  4965	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevil,) Men look not at the greatnesse of the evill past, but the
  4966	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgreatnesse of the good to follow." Whereby we are forbidden to inflict
  4967	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpunishment with any other designe, than for correction of the offender,
  4968	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor direction of others. For this Law is consequent to the next before
  4969	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit, that commandeth Pardon, upon security of the Future Time. Besides,
  4970	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRevenge without respect to the Example, and profit to come, is a
  4971	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttriumph, or glorying in the hurt of another, tending to no end; (for the
  4972	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEnd is alwayes somewhat to Come;) and glorying to no end, is vain-glory,
  4973	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand contrary to reason; and to hurt without reason, tendeth to the
  4974	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tintroduction of Warre; which is against the Law of Nature; and is
  4975	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommonly stiled by the name of Cruelty.

  4982	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd because all signes of hatred, or contempt, provoke to fight;
  4983	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinsomuch as most men choose rather to hazard their life, than not to be
  4984	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trevenged; we may in the eighth place, for a Law of Nature set down this
  4985	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPrecept, "That no man by deed, word, countenance, or gesture, declare
  4986	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHatred, or Contempt of another." The breach of which Law, is commonly

  4992	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Ninth, Against Pride
  4993	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  4994	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe question who is the better man, has no place in the condition of
  4995	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmeer Nature; where, (as has been shewn before,) all men are equall. The
  4996	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinequallity that now is, has been introduced by the Lawes civill. I know
  4997	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat Aristotle in the first booke of his Politiques, for a foundation of
  4998	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this doctrine, maketh men by Nature, some more worthy to Command, meaning
  4999	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe wiser sort (such as he thought himselfe to be for his Philosophy;)
  5000	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tothers to Serve, (meaning those that had strong bodies, but were not
  5001	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPhilosophers as he;) as if Master and Servant were not introduced by
  5002	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsent of men, but by difference of Wit; which is not only against
  5003	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treason; but also against experience. For there are very few so foolish,
  5004	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat had not rather governe themselves, than be governed by others:
  5005	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNor when the wise in their own conceit, contend by force, with them who
  5006	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdistrust their owne wisdome, do they alwaies, or often, or almost at any
  5007	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttime, get the Victory. If Nature therefore have made men equall, that
  5008	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tequalitie is to be acknowledged; or if Nature have made men unequall;
  5009	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tyet because men that think themselves equall, will not enter into
  5010	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconditions of Peace, but upon Equall termes, such equalitie must be
  5011	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tadmitted. And therefore for the ninth Law of Nature, I put this, "That
  5012	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevery man acknowledge other for his Equall by Nature." The breach of
  5013	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis Precept is Pride.

  5019	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5020	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOn this law, dependeth another, "That at the entrance into conditions of
  5021	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPeace, no man require to reserve to himselfe any Right, which he is not
  5022	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontent should be reserved to every one of the rest." As it is necessary
  5023	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor all men that seek peace, to lay down certaine Rights of Nature; that
  5024	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis to say, not to have libertie to do all they list: so is it necessarie
  5025	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor mans life, to retaine some; as right to governe their owne bodies;
  5026	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tenjoy aire, water, motion, waies to go from place to place; and all
  5027	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthings else without which a man cannot live, or not live well. If in
  5028	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis case, at the making of Peace, men require for themselves, that
  5029	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich they would not have to be granted to others, they do contrary
  5030	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto the precedent law, that commandeth the acknowledgement of naturall
  5031	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tequalitie, and therefore also against the law of Nature. The observers
  5032	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof this law, are those we call Modest, and the breakers Arrogant Men.
  5033	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Greeks call the violation of this law pleonexia; that is, a desire
  5034	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof more than their share.

  5042	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Law of Nature, "that he deale Equally between them." For without
  5043	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat, the Controversies of men cannot be determined but by Warre.
  5044	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHe therefore that is partiall in judgment, doth what in him lies, to
  5045	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdeterre men from the use of Judges, and Arbitrators; and consequently,
  5046	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(against the fundamentall Lawe of Nature) is the cause of Warre.

  5048	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe observance of this law, from the equall distribution to each man, of

  5057	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5058	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd from this followeth another law, "That such things as cannot be
  5059	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdivided, be enjoyed in Common, if it can be; and if the quantity of the
  5060	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthing permit, without Stint; otherwise Proportionably to the number of
  5061	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem that have Right." For otherwise the distribution is Unequall, and

  5069	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut some things there be, that can neither be divided, nor enjoyed in
  5070	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommon. Then, The Law of Nature, which prescribeth Equity, requireth,
  5071	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"That the Entire Right; or else, (making the use alternate,) the First
  5072	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPossession, be determined by Lot." For equall distribution, is of

  5081	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf Lots there be two sorts, Arbitrary, and Naturall. Arbitrary, is
  5082	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat which is agreed on by the Competitors; Naturall, is either
  5083	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPrimogeniture, (which the Greek calls Kleronomia, which signifies, Given

  5086	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd therefore those things which cannot be enjoyed in common, nor

  5105	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd because, though men be never so willing to observe these Lawes,
  5106	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere may neverthelesse arise questions concerning a mans action; First,
  5107	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhether it were done, or not done; Secondly (if done) whether against
  5108	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Law, or not against the Law; the former whereof, is called a
  5109	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tquestion Of Fact; the later a question Of Right; therefore unlesse the
  5110	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tparties to the question, Covenant mutually to stand to the sentence

  5112	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSentence they submit, is called an ARBITRATOR. And therefore it is of
  5113	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Law of Nature, "That they that are at controversie, submit their

  5225	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare names that signifie our Appetites, and Aversions; which in different
  5226	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttempers, customes, and doctrines of men, are different: And divers men,
  5227	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdiffer not onely in their Judgement, on the senses of what is pleasant,
  5228	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand unpleasant to the tast, smell, hearing, touch, and sight; but also
  5229	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof what is conformable, or disagreeable to Reason, in the actions of
  5230	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommon life. Nay, the same man, in divers times, differs from himselfe;
  5231	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand one time praiseth, that is, calleth Good, what another time
  5232	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the dispraiseth, and calleth Evil: From whence arise Disputes,
  5233	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tControversies, and at last War. And therefore so long as man is in the
  5234	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcondition of meer Nature, (which is a condition of War,) as private
  5235	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAppetite is the measure of Good, and Evill: and consequently all men
  5236	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagree on this, that Peace is Good, and therefore also the way, or
  5237	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmeans of Peace, which (as I have shewed before) are Justice, Gratitude,
  5238	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tModesty, Equity, Mercy, & the rest of the Laws of Nature, are good; that
  5239	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis to say, Morall Vertues; and their contrarie Vices, Evill. Now the
  5240	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tscience of Vertue and Vice, is Morall Philosophie; and therfore the true
  5241	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDoctrine of the Lawes of Nature, is the true Morall Philosophie. But the
  5242	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWriters of Morall Philosophie, though they acknowledge the same Vertues
  5243	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Vices; Yet not seeing wherein consisted their Goodnesse; nor that
  5244	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey come to be praised, as the meanes of peaceable, sociable, and
  5245	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcomfortable living; place them in a mediocrity of passions: as if not
  5246	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Cause, but the Degree of daring, made Fortitude; or not the Cause,
  5247	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut the Quantity of a gift, made Liberality.
  5248	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5249	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThese dictates of Reason, men use to call by the name of Lawes; but
  5250	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\timproperly: for they are but Conclusions, or Theoremes concerning what
  5251	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconduceth to the conservation and defence of themselves; whereas Law,
  5252	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tproperly is the word of him, that by right hath command over others. But
  5253	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tyet if we consider the same Theoremes, as delivered in the word of
  5254	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod, that by right commandeth all things; then are they properly called

  5281	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Word Person, Whence
  5282	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5283	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe word Person is latine: instead whereof the Greeks have Prosopon,
  5284	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich signifies the Face, as Persona in latine signifies the Disguise,
  5285	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor Outward Appearance of a man, counterfeited on the Stage; and somtimes
  5286	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmore particularly that part of it, which disguiseth the face, as a Mask
  5287	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor Visard: And from the Stage, hath been translated to any Representer
  5288	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof speech and action, as well in Tribunalls, as Theaters. So that a
  5289	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPerson, is the same that an Actor is, both on the Stage and in common
  5290	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConversation; and to Personate, is to Act, or Represent himselfe, or an
  5291	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother; and he that acteth another, is said to beare his Person, or
  5292	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tact in his name; (in which sence Cicero useth it where he saies, "Unus
  5293	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSustineo Tres Personas; Mei, Adversarii, & Judicis, I beare three
  5294	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPersons; my own, my Adversaries, and the Judges;") and is called in
  5295	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdiverse occasions, diversly; as a Representer, or Representative, a

  5301	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5302	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tActor, Author; Authority
  5303	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5304	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf Persons Artificiall, some have their words and actions Owned by
  5305	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose whom they represent. And then the Person is the Actor; and he that
  5306	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\towneth his words and actions, is the AUTHOR: In which case the
  5307	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tActor acteth by Authority. For that which in speaking of goods and
  5308	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpossessions, is called an Owner, and in latine Dominus, in Greeke
  5309	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKurios; speaking of Actions, is called Author. And as the Right of
  5310	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpossession, is called Dominion; so the Right of doing any Action, is
  5311	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcalled AUTHORITY. So that by Authority, is alwayes understood a Right
  5312	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof doing any act: and Done By Authority, done by Commission, or Licence
  5313	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom him whose right it is.

  5317	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5318	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCovenants By Authority, Bind The Author
  5319	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5320	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFrom hence it followeth, that when the Actor maketh a Covenant by
  5321	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAuthority, he bindeth thereby the Author, no lesse than if he had made
  5322	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit himselfe; and no lesse subjecteth him to all the consequences of the
  5323	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsame. And therfore all that hath been said formerly, (Chap. 14) of the
  5324	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnature of Covenants between man and man in their naturall capacity,
  5325	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis true also when they are made by their Actors, Representers, or
  5326	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tProcurators, that have authority from them, so far-forth as is in their
  5327	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommission, but no farther.
  5328	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5329	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd therefore he that maketh a Covenant with the Actor, or Representer,
  5330	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot knowing the Authority he hath, doth it at his own perill. For no man
  5331	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis obliged by a Covenant, whereof he is not Author; nor consequently by
  5332	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Covenant made against, or beside the Authority he gave.
  5333	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5334	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5335	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5336	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5337	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut Not The Actor
  5338	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5339	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhen the Actor doth any thing against the Law of Nature by command of
  5340	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Author, if he be obliged by former Covenant to obey him, not he, but
  5341	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Author breaketh the Law of Nature: for though the Action be against
  5342	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Law of Nature; yet it is not his: but contrarily; to refuse to do
  5343	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit, is against the Law of Nature, that forbiddeth breach of Covenant.
  5344	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5345	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5346	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5347	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5348	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Authority Is To Be Shewne
  5349	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5350	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd he that maketh a Covenant with the Author, by mediation of the
  5351	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tActor, not knowing what Authority he hath, but onely takes his word;
  5352	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin case such Authority be not made manifest unto him upon demand, is
  5353	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tno longer obliged: For the Covenant made with the Author, is not valid,
  5354	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twithout his Counter-assurance. But if he that so Covenanteth, knew
  5355	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbefore hand he was to expect no other assurance, than the Actors word;
  5356	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthen is the Covenant valid; because the Actor in this case maketh
  5357	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thimselfe the Author. And therefore, as when the Authority is evident,
  5358	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Covenant obligeth the Author, not the Actor; so when the Authority
  5359	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis feigned, it obligeth the Actor onely; there being no Author but
  5360	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thimselfe.

  5365	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThings Personated, Inanimate
  5366	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5367	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThere are few things, that are uncapable of being represented by
  5368	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFiction. Inanimate things, as a Church, an Hospital, a Bridge, may
  5369	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe Personated by a Rector, Master, or Overseer. But things Inanimate,
  5370	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcannot be Authors, nor therefore give Authority to their Actors: Yet the
  5371	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tActors may have Authority to procure their maintenance, given them by
  5372	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose that are Owners, or Governours of those things. And therefore,
  5373	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch things cannot be Personated, before there be some state of Civill
  5374	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGovernment.
  5375	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t

  5379	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIrrational
  5380	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5381	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLikewise Children, Fooles, and Mad-men that have no use of Reason, may
  5382	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe Personated by Guardians, or Curators; but can be no Authors (during
  5383	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat time) of any action done by them, longer then (when they shall
  5384	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trecover the use of Reason) they shall judge the same reasonable.
  5385	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tYet during the Folly, he that hath right of governing them, may give
  5386	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAuthority to the Guardian. But this again has no place but in a State
  5387	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCivill, because before such estate, there is no Dominion of Persons.

  5395	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGods of the Heathen; which by such Officers as the State appointed, were
  5396	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPersonated, and held Possessions, and other Goods, and Rights, which men
  5397	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom time to time dedicated, and consecrated unto them. But idols cannot
  5398	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe Authors: for a Idol is nothing. The Authority proceeded from the
  5399	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tState: and therefore before introduction of Civill Government, the Gods
  5400	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Heathen could not be Personated.

  5408	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Israelites, (that were not his, but Gods people,) not in his own
  5409	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tname, with Hoc Dicit Moses; but in Gods Name, with Hoc Dicit Dominus.
  5410	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSecondly, by the son of man, his own Son our Blessed Saviour Jesus
  5411	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChrist, that came to reduce the Jewes, and induce all Nations into the
  5412	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKingdome of his Father; not as of himselfe, but as sent from his Father.
  5413	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd thirdly, by the Holy Ghost, or Comforter, speaking, and working
  5414	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the Apostles: which Holy Ghost, was a Comforter that came not of

  5423	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tone Person, Represented; so that it be done with the consent of
  5424	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevery one of that Multitude in particular. For it is the Unity of the
  5425	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRepresenter, not the Unity of the Represented, that maketh the Person
  5426	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOne. And it is the Representer that beareth the Person, and but one

  5434	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd because the Multitude naturally is not One, but Many; they cannot

  5437	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommon Representer, Authority from himselfe in particular; and owning
  5438	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall the actions the Representer doth, in case they give him Authority
  5439	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twithout stint: Otherwise, when they limit him in what, and how farre

  5448	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd if the Representative consist of many men, the voyce of the greater
  5449	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnumber, must be considered as the voyce of them all. For if the lesser
  5450	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnumber pronounce (for example) in the Affirmative, and the greater in
  5451	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Negative, there will be Negatives more than enough to destroy

  5460	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd a Representative of even number, especially when the number is
  5461	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot great, whereby the contradictory voyces are oftentimes equall, is
  5462	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore oftentimes mute, and uncapable of Action. Yet in some cases
  5463	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontradictory voyces equall in number, may determine a question; as in
  5464	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcondemning, or absolving, equality of votes, even in that they condemne
  5465	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot, do absolve; but not on the contrary condemne, in that they absolve
  5466	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot. For when a Cause is heard; not to condemne, is to absolve; but on
  5467	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe contrary, to say that not absolving, is condemning, is not true. The
  5468	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlike it is in a deliberation of executing presently, or deferring
  5469	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttill another time; For when the voyces are equall, the not decreeing
  5470	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tExecution, is a decree of Dilation.

  5480	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRepresentative; because by the diversity of Opinions, and Interests of
  5481	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen, it becomes oftentimes, and in cases of the greatest consequence, a

  5484	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5485	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf Authors there be two sorts. The first simply so called; which I have

  5510	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe finall Cause, End, or Designe of men, (who naturally love Liberty,
  5511	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Dominion over others,) in the introduction of that restraint upon
  5512	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthemselves, (in which wee see them live in Common-wealths,) is the
  5513	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tforesight of their own preservation, and of a more contented life
  5514	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthereby; that is to say, of getting themselves out from that miserable
  5515	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcondition of Warre, which is necessarily consequent (as hath been shewn)
  5516	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto the naturall Passions of men, when there is no visible Power to keep
  5517	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem in awe, and tye them by feare of punishment to the performance of
  5518	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir Covenants, and observation of these Lawes of Nature set down in
  5519	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe fourteenth and fifteenth Chapters.

  5523	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5524	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhich Is Not To Be Had From The Law Of Nature:
  5525	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5526	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor the Lawes of Nature (as Justice, Equity, Modesty, Mercy, and (in
  5527	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsumme) Doing To Others, As Wee Would Be Done To,) if themselves, without
  5528	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe terrour of some Power, to cause them to be observed, are contrary to
  5529	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tour naturall Passions, that carry us to Partiality, Pride, Revenge, and
  5530	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe like. And Covenants, without the Sword, are but Words, and of no
  5531	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tstrength to secure a man at all. Therefore notwithstanding the Lawes of
  5532	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNature, (which every one hath then kept, when he has the will to keep
  5533	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem, when he can do it safely,) if there be no Power erected, or not
  5534	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgreat enough for our security; every man will and may lawfully rely on
  5535	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this own strength and art, for caution against all other men. And in all
  5536	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tplaces, where men have lived by small Families, to robbe and spoyle one
  5537	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tanother, has been a Trade, and so farre from being reputed against the
  5538	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaw of Nature, that the greater spoyles they gained, the greater was
  5539	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir honour; and men observed no other Lawes therein, but the Lawes of
  5540	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHonour; that is, to abstain from cruelty, leaving to men their lives,
  5541	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand instruments of husbandry. And as small Familyes did then; so now
  5542	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdo Cities and Kingdomes which are but greater Families (for their own
  5543	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsecurity) enlarge their Dominions, upon all pretences of danger, and
  5544	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfear of Invasion, or assistance that may be given to Invaders, endeavour
  5545	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas much as they can, to subdue, or weaken their neighbours, by open
  5546	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tforce, and secret arts, for want of other Caution, justly; and are
  5547	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trememdbred for it in after ages with honour.
  5548	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5549	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5550	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5551	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5552	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNor From The Conjunction Of A Few Men Or Familyes
  5553	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5554	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNor is it the joyning together of a small number of men, that gives them
  5555	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis security; because in small numbers, small additions on the one side
  5556	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor the other, make the advantage of strength so great, as is sufficient
  5557	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto carry the Victory; and therefore gives encouragement to an Invasion.
  5558	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Multitude sufficient to confide in for our Security, is not
  5559	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdetermined by any certain number, but by comparison with the Enemy we
  5560	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfeare; and is then sufficient, when the odds of the Enemy is not of so
  5561	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tvisible and conspicuous moment, to determine the event of warre, as to
  5562	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmove him to attempt.
  5563	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5564	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5565	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5566	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5567	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNor From A Great Multitude, Unlesse Directed By One Judgement
  5568	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5569	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd be there never so great a Multitude; yet if their actions be
  5570	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdirected according to their particular judgements, and particular
  5571	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tappetites, they can expect thereby no defence, nor protection, neither
  5572	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagainst a Common enemy, nor against the injuries of one another. For
  5573	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeing distracted in opinions concerning the best use and application
  5574	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof their strength, they do not help, but hinder one another; and reduce
  5575	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir strength by mutuall opposition to nothing: whereby they are
  5576	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teasily, not onely subdued by a very few that agree together; but also
  5577	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhen there is no common enemy, they make warre upon each other, for
  5578	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir particular interests. For if we could suppose a great Multitude of
  5579	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen to consent in the observation of Justice, and other Lawes of Nature,
  5580	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twithout a common Power to keep them all in awe; we might as well suppose
  5581	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall Man-kind to do the same; and then there neither would be nor need to
  5582	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe any Civill Government, or Common-wealth at all; because there would
  5583	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe Peace without subjection.
  5584	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5585	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5586	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5587	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5588	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd That Continually
  5589	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5590	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNor is it enough for the security, which men desire should last all
  5591	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe time of their life, that they be governed, and directed by one
  5592	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tjudgement, for a limited time; as in one Battell, or one Warre. For
  5593	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthough they obtain a Victory by their unanimous endeavour against a
  5594	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tforraign enemy; yet afterwards, when either they have no common enemy,
  5595	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor he that by one part is held for an enemy, is by another part held for
  5596	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta friend, they must needs by the difference of their interests dissolve,
  5597	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand fall again into a Warre amongst themselves.

  5602	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhy Certain Creatures Without Reason, Or Speech,
  5603	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5604	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5605	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5606	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5607	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDo Neverthelesse Live In Society, Without Any Coercive Power
  5608	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5609	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIt is true, that certain living creatures, as Bees, and Ants, live
  5610	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsociably one with another, (which are therefore by Aristotle numbred
  5611	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tamongst Politicall creatures;) and yet have no other direction, than
  5612	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir particular judgements and appetites; nor speech, whereby one of
  5613	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem can signifie to another, what he thinks expedient for the common
  5614	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbenefit: and therefore some man may perhaps desire to know, why Man-kind
  5615	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcannot do the same. To which I answer,
  5616	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5617	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFirst, that men are continually in competition for Honour and Dignity,
  5618	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich these creatures are not; and consequently amongst men there
  5619	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tariseth on that ground, Envy and Hatred, and finally Warre; but amongst
  5620	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthese not so.
  5621	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5622	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSecondly, that amongst these creatures, the Common good differeth not
  5623	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom the Private; and being by nature enclined to their private, they
  5624	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprocure thereby the common benefit. But man, whose Joy consisteth
  5625	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin comparing himselfe with other men, can relish nothing but what is
  5626	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teminent.
  5627	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5628	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThirdly, that these creatures, having not (as man) the use of reason,
  5629	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdo not see, nor think they see any fault, in the administration of their
  5630	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommon businesse: whereas amongst men, there are very many, that thinke
  5631	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthemselves wiser, and abler to govern the Publique, better than the
  5632	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trest; and these strive to reforme and innovate, one this way, another
  5633	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat way; and thereby bring it into Distraction and Civill warre.
  5634	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5635	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFourthly, that these creatures, though they have some use of voice, in
  5636	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmaking knowne to one another their desires, and other affections; yet
  5637	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey want that art of words, by which some men can represent to others,
  5638	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat which is Good, in the likenesse of Evill; and Evill, in the
  5639	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlikenesse of Good; and augment, or diminish the apparent greatnesse of
  5640	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGood and Evill; discontenting men, and troubling their Peace at their
  5641	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpleasure.
  5642	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5643	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFiftly, irrationall creatures cannot distinguish betweene Injury, and
  5644	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDammage; and therefore as long as they be at ease, they are not offended
  5645	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith their fellowes: whereas Man is then most troublesome, when he is
  5646	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmost at ease: for then it is that he loves to shew his Wisdome, and
  5647	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontroule the Actions of them that governe the Common-wealth.
  5648	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5649	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLastly, the agreement of these creatures is Naturall; that of men, is
  5650	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby Covenant only, which is Artificiall: and therefore it is no wonder
  5651	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tif there be somewhat else required (besides Covenant) to make their
  5652	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAgreement constant and lasting; which is a Common Power, to keep them in
  5653	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tawe, and to direct their actions to the Common Benefit.

  5659	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5660	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe only way to erect such a Common Power, as may be able to defend them
  5661	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom the invasion of Forraigners, and the injuries of one another, and
  5662	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthereby to secure them in such sort, as that by their owne industrie,
  5663	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand by the fruites of the Earth, they may nourish themselves and live
  5664	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontentedly; is, to conferre all their power and strength upon one
  5665	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMan, or upon one Assembly of men, that may reduce all their Wills,
  5666	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby plurality of voices, unto one Will: which is as much as to say, to
  5667	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tappoint one man, or Assembly of men, to beare their Person; and every
  5668	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tone to owne, and acknowledge himselfe to be Author of whatsoever he
  5669	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat so beareth their Person, shall Act, or cause to be Acted, in those
  5670	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthings which concerne the Common Peace and Safetie; and therein to
  5671	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsubmit their Wills, every one to his Will, and their Judgements, to his
  5672	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJudgment. This is more than Consent, or Concord; it is a reall Unitie of
  5673	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem all, in one and the same Person, made by Covenant of every man with
  5674	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevery man, in such manner, as if every man should say to every man, "I
  5675	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAuthorise and give up my Right of Governing my selfe, to this Man, or to
  5676	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis Assembly of men, on this condition, that thou give up thy Right
  5677	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto him, and Authorise all his Actions in like manner." This done, the
  5678	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMultitude so united in one Person, is called a COMMON-WEALTH, in latine
  5679	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCIVITAS. This is the Generation of that great LEVIATHAN, or rather (to
  5680	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tspeake more reverently) of that Mortall God, to which wee owe under the
  5681	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tImmortall God, our peace and defence. For by this Authoritie, given him
  5682	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby every particular man in the Common-Wealth, he hath the use of so
  5683	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmuch Power and Strength conferred on him, that by terror thereof, he is
  5684	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinabled to forme the wills of them all, to Peace at home, and mutuall
  5685	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tayd against their enemies abroad.

  5691	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5692	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd in him consisteth the Essence of the Common-wealth; which (to
  5693	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdefine it,) is "One Person, of whose Acts a great Multitude, by mutuall
  5694	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCovenants one with another, have made themselves every one the Author,
  5695	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto the end he may use the strength and means of them all, as he shall
  5696	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthink expedient, for their Peace and Common Defence."

  5702	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5703	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd he that carryeth this Person, as called SOVERAIGNE, and said to have
  5704	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraigne Power; and every one besides, his SUBJECT.
  5705	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5706	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe attaining to this Soveraigne Power, is by two wayes. One, by
  5707	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNaturall force; as when a man maketh his children, to submit themselves,
  5708	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand their children to his government, as being able to destroy them if
  5709	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey refuse, or by Warre subdueth his enemies to his will, giving them
  5710	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir lives on that condition. The other, is when men agree amongst
  5711	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthemselves, to submit to some Man, or Assembly of men, voluntarily, on
  5712	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconfidence to be protected by him against all others. This later, may be
  5713	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcalled a Politicall Common-wealth, or Common-wealth by Institution; and
  5714	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe former, a Common-wealth by Acquisition. And first, I shall speak of

  5728	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor Assembly Of Men, shall be given by the major part, the Right

  5752	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5753	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFirst, because they Covenant, it is to be understood, they are not
  5754	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobliged by former Covenant to any thing repugnant hereunto. And
  5755	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConsequently they that have already Instituted a Common-wealth, being
  5756	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthereby bound by Covenant, to own the Actions, and Judgements of one,
  5757	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcannot lawfully make a new Covenant, amongst themselves, to be obedient
  5758	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto any other, in any thing whatsoever, without his permission. And
  5759	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore, they that are subjects to a Monarch, cannot without his leave
  5760	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcast off Monarchy, and return to the confusion of a disunited Multitude;
  5761	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnor transferre their Person from him that beareth it, to another Man,
  5762	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor other Assembly of men: for they are bound, every man to every man,
  5763	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto Own, and be reputed Author of all, that he that already is their
  5764	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraigne, shall do, and judge fit to be done: so that any one man
  5765	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdissenting, all the rest should break their Covenant made to that man,
  5766	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich is injustice: and they have also every man given the Soveraignty
  5767	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto him that beareth their Person; and therefore if they depose him,
  5768	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey take from him that which is his own, and so again it is injustice.
  5769	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBesides, if he that attempteth to depose his Soveraign, be killed, or
  5770	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpunished by him for such attempt, he is author of his own punishment,
  5771	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas being by the Institution, Author of all his Soveraign shall do: And
  5772	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbecause it is injustice for a man to do any thing, for which he may be
  5773	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpunished by his own authority, he is also upon that title, unjust.
  5774	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd whereas some men have pretended for their disobedience to their
  5775	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign, a new Covenant, made, not with men, but with God; this also
  5776	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis unjust: for there is no Covenant with God, but by mediation of some
  5777	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbody that representeth Gods Person; which none doth but Gods Lieutenant,
  5778	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twho hath the Soveraignty under God. But this pretence of Covenant with
  5779	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod, is so evident a lye, even in the pretenders own consciences, that
  5780	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit is not onely an act of an unjust, but also of a vile, and unmanly
  5781	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdisposition.
  5782	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5783	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5784	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5785	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5786	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t2. Soveraigne Power Cannot Be Forfeited
  5787	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5788	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSecondly, Because the Right of bearing the Person of them all, is given
  5789	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto him they make Soveraigne, by Covenant onely of one to another, and
  5790	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot of him to any of them; there can happen no breach of Covenant on the
  5791	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpart of the Soveraigne; and consequently none of his Subjects, by any
  5792	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpretence of forfeiture, can be freed from his Subjection. That he which
  5793	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis made Soveraigne maketh no Covenant with his Subjects beforehand, is
  5794	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmanifest; because either he must make it with the whole multitude, as
  5795	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tone party to the Covenant; or he must make a severall Covenant with
  5796	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevery man. With the whole, as one party, it is impossible; because as
  5797	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tyet they are not one Person: and if he make so many severall Covenants
  5798	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas there be men, those Covenants after he hath the Soveraignty are voyd,
  5799	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbecause what act soever can be pretended by any one of them for breach
  5800	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthereof, is the act both of himselfe, and of all the rest, because done
  5801	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the Person, and by the Right of every one of them in particular.
  5802	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBesides, if any one, or more of them, pretend a breach of the Covenant
  5803	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmade by the Soveraigne at his Institution; and others, or one other of
  5804	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this Subjects, or himselfe alone, pretend there was no such breach,
  5805	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere is in this case, no Judge to decide the controversie: it returns
  5806	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore to the Sword again; and every man recovereth the right of
  5807	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tProtecting himselfe by his own strength, contrary to the designe they
  5808	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thad in the Institution. It is therefore in vain to grant Soveraignty by
  5809	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tway of precedent Covenant. The opinion that any Monarch receiveth his
  5810	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPower by Covenant, that is to say on Condition, proceedeth from want
  5811	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof understanding this easie truth, that Covenants being but words, and
  5812	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbreath, have no force to oblige, contain, constrain, or protect any man,
  5813	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut what it has from the publique Sword; that is, from the untyed hands
  5814	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof that Man, or Assembly of men that hath the Soveraignty, and whose
  5815	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tactions are avouched by them all, and performed by the strength of them
  5816	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall, in him united. But when an Assembly of men is made Soveraigne; then
  5817	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tno man imagineth any such Covenant to have past in the Institution; for
  5818	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tno man is so dull as to say, for example, the People of Rome, made
  5819	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Covenant with the Romans, to hold the Soveraignty on such or such
  5820	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconditions; which not performed, the Romans might lawfully depose the
  5821	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRoman People. That men see not the reason to be alike in a Monarchy, and
  5822	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin a Popular Government, proceedeth from the ambition of some, that
  5823	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare kinder to the government of an Assembly, whereof they may hope to
  5824	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tparticipate, than of Monarchy, which they despair to enjoy.
  5825	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5826	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5827	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5828	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5829	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t3. No Man Can Without Injustice Protest Against The
  5830	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5831	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInstitution Of The Soveraigne Declared By The Major Part. Thirdly,
  5832	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbecause the major part hath by consenting voices declared a Soveraigne;
  5833	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the that dissented must now consent with the rest; that is, be contented
  5834	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto avow all the actions he shall do, or else justly be destroyed by the
  5835	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trest. For if he voluntarily entered into the Congregation of them that
  5836	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere assembled, he sufficiently declared thereby his will (and therefore
  5837	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttacitely covenanted) to stand to what the major part should ordayne: and
  5838	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore if he refuse to stand thereto, or make Protestation against
  5839	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tany of their Decrees, he does contrary to his Covenant, and therfore
  5840	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunjustly. And whether he be of the Congregation, or not; and whether his
  5841	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsent be asked, or not, he must either submit to their decrees, or
  5842	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe left in the condition of warre he was in before; wherein he might
  5843	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twithout injustice be destroyed by any man whatsoever.
  5844	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5845	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5846	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5847	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5848	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t4. The Soveraigns Actions Cannot Be Justly Accused By The Subject
  5849	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5850	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFourthly, because every Subject is by this Institution Author of all the
  5851	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tActions, and Judgements of the Soveraigne Instituted; it followes, that
  5852	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhatsoever he doth, it can be no injury to any of his Subjects; nor
  5853	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tought he to be by any of them accused of Injustice. For he that doth any
  5854	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthing by authority from another, doth therein no injury to him by whose
  5855	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tauthority he acteth: But by this Institution of a Common-wealth, every
  5856	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tparticular man is Author of all the Soveraigne doth; and consequently
  5857	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the that complaineth of injury from his Soveraigne, complaineth of that
  5858	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhereof he himselfe is Author; and therefore ought not to accuse any man
  5859	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut himselfe; no nor himselfe of injury; because to do injury to ones
  5860	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tselfe, is impossible. It is true that they that have Soveraigne
  5861	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpower, may commit Iniquity; but not Injustice, or Injury in the proper
  5862	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsignification.
  5863	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5864	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5865	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5866	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5867	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t5. What Soever The Soveraigne Doth, Is Unpunishable By The Subject
  5868	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5869	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFiftly, and consequently to that which was sayd last, no man that hath
  5870	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraigne power can justly be put to death, or otherwise in any manner
  5871	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby his Subjects punished. For seeing every Subject is author of the
  5872	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tactions of his Soveraigne; he punisheth another, for the actions
  5873	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommitted by himselfe.
  5874	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5875	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5876	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5877	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5878	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t6. The Soveraigne Is Judge Of What Is Necessary For The Peace
  5879	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5880	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd Defence Of His Subjects
  5881	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5882	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd because the End of this Institution, is the Peace and Defence of
  5883	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem all; and whosoever has right to the End, has right to the Means;
  5884	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit belongeth of Right, to whatsoever Man, or Assembly that hath the
  5885	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraignty, to be Judge both of the meanes of Peace and Defence;
  5886	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand also of the hindrances, and disturbances of the same; and to do
  5887	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhatsoever he shall think necessary to be done, both beforehand, for the
  5888	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpreserving of Peace and Security, by prevention of discord at home and
  5889	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHostility from abroad; and, when Peace and Security are lost, for the
  5890	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trecovery of the same. And therefore,
  5891	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5892	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5893	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5894	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5895	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd Judge Of What Doctrines Are Fit To Be Taught Them
  5896	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5897	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSixtly, it is annexed to the Soveraignty, to be Judge of what Opinions
  5898	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Doctrines are averse, and what conducing to Peace; and consequently,
  5899	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ton what occasions, how farre, and what, men are to be trusted withall,
  5900	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin speaking to Multitudes of people; and who shall examine the Doctrines
  5901	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof all bookes before they be published. For the Actions of men proceed
  5902	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom their Opinions; and in the wel governing of Opinions, consisteth
  5903	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe well governing of mens Actions, in order to their Peace, and
  5904	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConcord. And though in matter of Doctrine, nothing ought to be regarded
  5905	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut the Truth; yet this is not repugnant to regulating of the same by
  5906	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPeace. For Doctrine Repugnant to Peace, can no more be True, than Peace
  5907	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Concord can be against the Law of Nature. It is true, that in
  5908	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Common-wealth, where by the negligence, or unskilfullnesse of
  5909	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGovernours, and Teachers, false Doctrines are by time generally
  5910	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treceived; the contrary Truths may be generally offensive; Yet the most
  5911	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsudden, and rough busling in of a new Truth, that can be, does never
  5912	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbreake the Peace, but onely somtimes awake the Warre. For those men that
  5913	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare so remissely governed, that they dare take up Armes, to defend, or
  5914	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tintroduce an Opinion, are still in Warre; and their condition not Peace,
  5915	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut only a Cessation of Armes for feare of one another; and they live
  5916	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas it were, in the procincts of battaile continually. It belongeth
  5917	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore to him that hath the Soveraign Power, to be Judge, or
  5918	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconstitute all Judges of Opinions and Doctrines, as a thing necessary to
  5919	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPeace, thereby to prevent Discord and Civill Warre.

  5922	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5923	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5924	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t7. The Right Of Making Rules, Whereby The Subject May
  5925	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5926	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEvery Man Know What Is So His Owne, As No Other Subject
  5927	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5928	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCan Without Injustice Take It From Him
  5929	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5930	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSeventhly, is annexed to the Soveraigntie, the whole power of
  5931	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprescribing the Rules, whereby every man may know, what Goods he may
  5932	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tenjoy and what Actions he may doe, without being molested by any of
  5933	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this fellow Subjects: And this is it men Call Propriety. For before
  5934	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconstitution of Soveraign Power (as hath already been shewn) all men had
  5935	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tright to all things; which necessarily causeth Warre: and therefore this
  5936	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tProprietie, being necessary to Peace, and depending on Soveraign Power,
  5937	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis the Act of the Power, in order to the publique peace. These Rules of
  5938	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPropriety (or Meum and Tuum) and of Good, Evill, Lawfull and Unlawfull
  5939	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the actions of subjects, are the Civill Lawes, that is to say, the
  5940	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlawes of each Commonwealth in particular; though the name of Civill Law
  5941	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe now restrained to the antient Civill Lawes of the City of Rome; which
  5942	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeing the head of a great part of the World, her Lawes at that time were
  5943	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin these parts the Civill Law.
  5944	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5945	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5946	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5947	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5948	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t8. To Him Also Belongeth The Right Of All Judicature
  5949	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5950	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd Decision Of Controversies:
  5951	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5952	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEightly, is annexed to the Soveraigntie, the Right of Judicature; that
  5953	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis to say, of hearing and deciding all Controversies, which may arise
  5954	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconcerning Law, either Civill, or naturall, or concerning Fact. For
  5955	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twithout the decision of Controversies, there is no protection of one
  5956	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSubject, against the injuries of another; the Lawes concerning Meum and
  5957	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTuum are in vaine; and to every man remaineth, from the naturall and
  5958	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnecessary appetite of his own conservation, the right of protecting
  5959	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thimselfe by his private strength, which is the condition of Warre; and
  5960	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontrary to the end for which every Common-wealth is instituted.
  5961	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5962	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5963	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5964	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5965	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t9. And Of Making War, And Peace, As He Shall Think Best:
  5966	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5967	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNinthly, is annexed to the Soveraignty, the Right of making Warre, and
  5968	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPeace with other Nations, and Common-wealths; that is to say, of
  5969	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJudging when it is for the publique good, and how great forces are to
  5970	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe assembled, armed, and payd for that end; and to levy mony upon the
  5971	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSubjects, to defray the expenses thereof. For the Power by which the
  5972	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpeople are to be defended, consisteth in their Armies; and the strength
  5973	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof an Army, in the union of their strength under one Command; which
  5974	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommand the Soveraign Instituted, therefore hath; because the command
  5975	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Militia, without other Institution, maketh him that hath it
  5976	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign. And therefore whosoever is made Generall of an Army, he that
  5977	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thath the Soveraign Power is alwayes Generallissimo.
  5978	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5979	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5980	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5981	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5982	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t10. And Of Choosing All Counsellours, And Ministers,
  5983	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5984	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBoth Of Peace, And Warre:
  5985	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5986	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTenthly, is annexed to the Soveraignty, the choosing of all
  5987	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCouncellours, Ministers, Magistrates, and Officers, both in peace, and
  5988	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWar. For seeing the Soveraign is charged with the End, which is the
  5989	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommon Peace and Defence; he is understood to have Power to use such
  5990	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMeans, as he shall think most fit for his discharge.
  5991	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5992	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5993	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5994	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5995	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t11. And Of Rewarding, And Punishing, And That (Where No
  5996	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5997	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFormer Law hath Determined The Measure Of It) Arbitrary:
  5998	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  5999	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEleventhly, to the Soveraign is committed the Power of Rewarding
  6000	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith riches, or honour; and of Punishing with corporall, or pecuniary
  6001	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpunishment, or with ignominy every Subject according to the Lawe he hath
  6002	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tformerly made; or if there be no Law made, according as he shall judge
  6003	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmost to conduce to the encouraging of men to serve the Common-wealth, or
  6004	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdeterring of them from doing dis-service to the same.
  6005	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6006	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6007	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6008	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6009	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t12. And Of Honour And Order
  6010	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6011	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLastly, considering what values men are naturally apt to set upon
  6012	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthemselves; what respect they look for from others; and how little they
  6013	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tvalue other men; from whence continually arise amongst them, Emulation,
  6014	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tQuarrells, Factions, and at last Warre, to the destroying of one
  6015	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tanother, and diminution of their strength against a Common Enemy; It
  6016	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis necessary that there be Lawes of Honour, and a publique rate of the
  6017	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tworth of such men as have deserved, or are able to deserve well of the
  6018	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth; and that there be force in the hands of some or other, to
  6019	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tput those Lawes in execution. But it hath already been shown, that not
  6020	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tonely the whole Militia, or forces of the Common-wealth; but also the
  6021	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJudicature of all Controversies, is annexed to the Soveraignty. To the
  6022	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign therefore it belongeth also to give titles of Honour; and to
  6023	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tappoint what Order of place, and dignity, each man shall hold; and what
  6024	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsignes of respect, in publique or private meetings, they shall give to
  6025	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tone another.
  6026	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6027	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6028	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6029	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6030	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThese Rights Are Indivisible
  6031	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6032	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThese are the Rights, which make the Essence of Soveraignty; and which
  6033	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare the markes, whereby a man may discern in what Man, or Assembly
  6034	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof men, the Soveraign Power is placed, and resideth. For these are
  6035	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tincommunicable, and inseparable. The Power to coyn Mony; to dispose of
  6036	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe estate and persons of Infant heires; to have praeemption in
  6037	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMarkets; and all other Statute Praerogatives, may be transferred by the
  6038	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign; and yet the Power to protect his Subject be retained. But if
  6039	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the transferre the Militia, he retains the Judicature in vain, for want
  6040	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof execution of the Lawes; Or if he grant away the Power of raising
  6041	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMony; the Militia is in vain: or if he give away the government of
  6042	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdoctrines, men will be frighted into rebellion with the feare of
  6043	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSpirits. And so if we consider any one of the said Rights, we shall
  6044	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpresently see, that the holding of all the rest, will produce no
  6045	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teffect, in the conservation of Peace and Justice, the end for which all
  6046	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealths are Instituted. And this division is it, whereof it is
  6047	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsaid, "A kingdome divided in it selfe cannot stand:" For unlesse this
  6048	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdivision precede, division into opposite Armies can never happen. If
  6049	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere had not first been an opinion received of the greatest part of
  6050	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEngland, that these Powers were divided between the King, and the Lords,
  6051	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand the House of Commons, the people had never been divided, and
  6052	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfallen into this Civill Warre; first between those that disagreed
  6053	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin Politiques; and after between the Dissenters about the liberty of
  6054	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tReligion; which have so instructed men in this point of Soveraign Right,
  6055	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat there be few now (in England,) that do not see, that these Rights
  6056	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare inseparable, and will be so generally acknowledged, at the next
  6057	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treturn of Peace; and so continue, till their miseries are forgotten; and
  6058	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tno longer, except the vulgar be better taught than they have hetherto

  6068	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd because they are essentiall and inseparable Rights, it follows
  6069	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnecessarily, that in whatsoever, words any of them seem to be granted
  6070	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\taway, yet if the Soveraign Power it selfe be not in direct termes
  6071	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trenounced, and the name of Soveraign no more given by the Grantees to
  6072	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim that Grants them, the Grant is voyd: for when he has granted all he
  6073	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcan, if we grant back the Soveraignty, all is restored, as inseparably

  6081	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf The Power Soveraign

  6083	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThis great Authority being indivisible, and inseparably annexed to the
  6084	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraignty, there is little ground for the opinion of them, that say of
  6085	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign Kings, though they be Singulis Majores, of greater Power than
  6086	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevery one of their Subjects, yet they be Universis Minores, of lesse
  6087	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpower than them all together. For if by All Together, they mean not
  6088	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe collective body as one person, then All Together, and Every One,
  6089	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsignifie the same; and the speech is absurd. But if by All Together,
  6090	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey understand them as one Person (which person the Soveraign bears,)
  6091	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthen the power of all together, is the same with the Soveraigns power;
  6092	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand so again the speech is absurd; which absurdity they see well enough,
  6093	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhen the Soveraignty is in an Assembly of the people; but in a Monarch
  6094	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey see it not; and yet the power of Soveraignty is the same in
  6095	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhomsoever it be placed.
  6096	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6097	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd as the Power, so also the Honour of the Soveraign, ought to be
  6098	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgreater, than that of any, or all the Subjects. For in the Soveraignty
  6099	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis the fountain of Honour. The dignities of Lord, Earle, Duke, and
  6100	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPrince are his Creatures. As in the presence of the Master, the Servants
  6101	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare equall, and without any honour at all; So are the Subjects, in the
  6102	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpresence of the Soveraign. And though they shine some more, some lesse,
  6103	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhen they are out of his sight; yet in his presence, they shine no more
  6104	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthan the Starres in presence of the Sun.

  6117	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof him, or them that have so unlimited a Power in their hands. And
  6118	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommonly they that live under a Monarch, think it the fault of Monarchy;
  6119	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand they that live under the government of Democracy, or other
  6120	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign Assembly, attribute all the inconvenience to that forme of
  6121	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth; whereas the Power in all formes, if they be perfect
  6122	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tenough to protect them, is the same; not considering that the estate
  6123	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Man can never be without some incommodity or other; and that the
  6124	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgreatest, that in any forme of Government can possibly happen to the

  6128	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcoercive Power to tye their hands from rapine, and revenge: nor
  6129	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsidering that the greatest pressure of Soveraign Governours,
  6130	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tproceedeth not from any delight, or profit they can expect in the

  6132	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir own selves, that unwillingly contributing to their own defence,

  6151	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Different Formes Of Common-wealths But Three
  6152	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6153	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe difference of Common-wealths, consisteth in the difference of the
  6154	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign, or the Person representative of all and every one of the
  6155	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMultitude. And because the Soveraignty is either in one Man, or in an
  6156	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAssembly of more than one; and into that Assembly either Every man hath
  6157	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tright to enter, or not every one, but Certain men distinguished from the
  6158	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trest; it is manifest, there can be but Three kinds of Common-wealth. For
  6159	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Representative must needs be One man, or More: and if more, then it
  6160	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis the Assembly of All, or but of a Part. When the Representative is One
  6161	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman, then is the Common-wealth a MONARCHY: when an Assembly of All that
  6162	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twill come together, then it is a DEMOCRACY, or Popular Common-wealth:
  6163	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhen an Assembly of a Part onely, then it is called an ARISTOCRACY.
  6164	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOther kind of Common-wealth there can be none: for either One, or
  6165	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMore, or All must have the Soveraign Power (which I have shewn to be
  6166	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tindivisible) entire.

  6171	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTyranny And Oligarchy, But Different Names Of Monarchy, And Aristocracy
  6172	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6173	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThere be other names of Government, in the Histories, and books of
  6174	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPolicy; as Tyranny, and Oligarchy: But they are not the names of other
  6175	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFormes of Government, but of the same Formes misliked. For they that
  6176	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare discontented under Monarchy, call it Tyranny; and they that are
  6177	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdispleased with Aristocracy, called it Oligarchy: so also, they which
  6178	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfind themselves grieved under a Democracy, call it Anarchy, (which
  6179	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsignifies want of Government;) and yet I think no man believes, that
  6180	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twant of Government, is any new kind of Government: nor by the same
  6181	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treason ought they to believe, that the Government is of one kind, when
  6182	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey like it, and another, when they mislike it, or are oppressed by the
  6183	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGovernours.

  6185	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6186	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6187	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6188	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSubordinate Representatives Dangerous
  6189	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6190	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIt is manifest, that men who are in absolute liberty, may, if they
  6191	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tplease, give Authority to One Man, to represent them every one; as
  6192	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twell as give such Authority to any Assembly of men whatsoever; and
  6193	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsequently may subject themselves, if they think good, to a Monarch,
  6194	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas absolutely, as to any other Representative. Therefore, where there is
  6195	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talready erected a Soveraign Power, there can be no other Representative
  6196	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the same people, but onely to certain particular ends, by the
  6197	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign limited. For that were to erect two Soveraigns; and every
  6198	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman to have his person represented by two Actors, that by opposing one
  6199	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tanother, must needs divide that Power, which (if men will live in Peace)
  6200	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis indivisible, and thereby reduce the Multitude into the condition of
  6201	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWarre, contrary to the end for which all Soveraignty is instituted. And
  6202	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore as it is absurd, to think that a Soveraign Assembly, inviting
  6203	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe People of their Dominion, to send up their Deputies, with power
  6204	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto make known their Advise, or Desires, should therefore hold such
  6205	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDeputies, rather than themselves, for the absolute Representative of
  6206	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe people: so it is absurd also, to think the same in a Monarchy. And
  6207	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tI know not how this so manifest a truth, should of late be so little
  6208	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobserved; that in a Monarchy, he that had the Soveraignty from a descent
  6209	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof 600 years, was alone called Soveraign, had the title of Majesty from
  6210	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevery one of his Subjects, and was unquestionably taken by them
  6211	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor their King; was notwithstanding never considered as their
  6212	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRepresentative; that name without contradiction passing for the title
  6213	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof those men, which at his command were sent up by the people to carry
  6214	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir Petitions, and give him (if he permitted it) their advise. Which
  6215	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmay serve as an admonition, for those that are the true, and absolute
  6216	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRepresentative of a People, to instruct men in the nature of that
  6217	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOffice, and to take heed how they admit of any other generall
  6218	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRepresentation upon any occasion whatsoever, if they mean to discharge
  6219	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe truth committed to them.

  6221	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6222	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6223	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6224	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tComparison Of Monarchy, With Soveraign Assemblyes
  6225	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6226	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe difference between these three kindes of Common-wealth, consisteth
  6227	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot in the difference of Power; but in the difference of Convenience, or
  6228	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAptitude to produce the Peace, and Security of the people; for which end
  6229	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey were instituted. And to compare Monarchy with the other two, we may
  6230	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobserve; First, that whosoever beareth the Person of the people, or
  6231	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis one of that Assembly that bears it, beareth also his own naturall
  6232	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPerson. And though he be carefull in his politique Person to procure
  6233	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe common interest; yet he is more, or no lesse carefull to procure the
  6234	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprivate good of himselfe, his family, kindred and friends; and for the
  6235	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmost part, if the publique interest chance to crosse the private, he
  6236	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpreferrs the private: for the Passions of men, are commonly more potent
  6237	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthan their Reason. From whence it follows, that where the publique and
  6238	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprivate interest are most closely united, there is the publique most
  6239	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tadvanced. Now in Monarchy, the private interest is the same with the
  6240	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpublique. The riches, power, and honour of a Monarch arise onely from
  6241	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe riches, strength and reputation of his Subjects. For no King can
  6242	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe rich, nor glorious, nor secure; whose Subjects are either poore, or
  6243	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontemptible, or too weak through want, or dissention, to maintain a
  6244	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twar against their enemies: Whereas in a Democracy, or Aristocracy, the
  6245	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpublique prosperity conferres not so much to the private fortune of one
  6246	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat is corrupt, or ambitious, as doth many times a perfidious advice, a
  6247	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttreacherous action, or a Civill warre.
  6248	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6249	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSecondly, that a Monarch receiveth counsell of whom, when, and where he
  6250	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpleaseth; and consequently may heare the opinion of men versed in the
  6251	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmatter about which he deliberates, of what rank or quality soever, and
  6252	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas long before the time of action, and with as much secrecy, as he will.
  6253	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut when a Soveraigne Assembly has need of Counsell, none are admitted
  6254	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut such as have a Right thereto from the beginning; which for the
  6255	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmost part are of those who have beene versed more in the acquisition
  6256	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Wealth than of Knowledge; and are to give their advice in long
  6257	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdiscourses, which may, and do commonly excite men to action, but
  6258	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot governe them in it. For the Understanding is by the flame of the
  6259	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPassions, never enlightned, but dazled: Nor is there any place, or time,
  6260	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twherein an Assemblie can receive Counsell with secrecie, because of
  6261	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir owne Multitude.
  6262	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6263	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThirdly, that the Resolutions of a Monarch, are subject to no other
  6264	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInconstancy, than that of Humane Nature; but in Assemblies, besides that
  6265	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Nature, there ariseth an Inconstancy from the Number. For the absence
  6266	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof a few, that would have the Resolution once taken, continue firme,
  6267	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(which may happen by security, negligence, or private impediments,) or
  6268	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe diligent appearance of a few of the contrary opinion, undoes to day,
  6269	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall that was concluded yesterday.
  6270	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6271	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFourthly, that a Monarch cannot disagree with himselfe, out of envy, or
  6272	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinterest; but an Assembly may; and that to such a height, as may produce
  6273	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Civill Warre.
  6274	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6275	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFifthly, that in Monarchy there is this inconvenience; that any Subject,
  6276	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby the power of one man, for the enriching of a favourite or flatterer,
  6277	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmay be deprived of all he possesseth; which I confesse is a great and
  6278	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinevitable inconvenience. But the same may as well happen, where the
  6279	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraigne Power is in an Assembly: for their power is the same; and
  6280	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey are as subject to evill Counsell, and to be seduced by Orators, as
  6281	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Monarch by Flatterers; and becoming one an others Flatterers, serve
  6282	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tone anothers Covetousnesse and Ambition by turnes. And whereas the
  6283	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFavorites of an Assembly, are many; and the Kindred much more numerous,
  6284	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthan of any Monarch. Besides, there is no Favourite of a Monarch, which
  6285	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcannot as well succour his friends, as hurt his enemies: But Orators,
  6286	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat is to say, Favourites of Soveraigne Assemblies, though they have
  6287	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgreat power to hurt, have little to save. For to accuse, requires lesse
  6288	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEloquence (such is mans Nature) than to excuse; and condemnation, than
  6289	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tabsolution more resembles Justice.
  6290	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6291	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSixtly, that it is an inconvenience in Monarchie, that the Soveraigntie
  6292	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmay descend upon an Infant, or one that cannot discerne between Good and
  6293	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEvill: and consisteth in this, that the use of his Power, must be in the
  6294	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thand of another Man, or of some Assembly of men, which are to governe by
  6295	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this right, and in his name; as Curators, and Protectors of his Person,
  6296	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Authority. But to say there is inconvenience, in putting the use of
  6297	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Soveraign Power, into the hand of a Man, or an Assembly of men; is
  6298	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto say that all Government is more Inconvenient, than Confusion, and
  6299	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCivill Warre. And therefore all the danger that can be pretended, must
  6300	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tarise from the Contention of those, that for an office of so great
  6301	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thonour, and profit, may become Competitors. To make it appear, that
  6302	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis inconvenience, proceedeth not from that forme of Government we call
  6303	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMonarchy, we are to consider, that the precedent Monarch, hath appointed
  6304	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twho shall have the Tuition of his Infant Successor, either expressely
  6305	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby Testament, or tacitly, by not controlling the Custome in that
  6306	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcase received: And then such inconvenience (if it happen) is to be
  6307	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tattributed, not to the Monarchy, but to the Ambition, and Injustice of
  6308	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Subjects; which in all kinds of Government, where the people are
  6309	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot well instructed in their Duty, and the Rights of Soveraignty, is
  6310	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe same. Or else the precedent Monarch, hath not at all taken order for
  6311	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch Tuition; And then the Law of Nature hath provided this sufficient
  6312	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trule, That the Tuition shall be in him, that hath by Nature most
  6313	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinterest in the preservation of the Authority of the Infant, and to whom
  6314	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tleast benefit can accrue by his death, or diminution. For seeing every
  6315	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman by nature seeketh his own benefit, and promotion; to put an Infant
  6316	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinto the power of those, that can promote themselves by his destruction,
  6317	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor dammage, is not Tuition, but Trechery. So that sufficient provision
  6318	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeing taken, against all just quarrell, about the Government under a
  6319	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChild, if any contention arise to the disturbance of the publique Peace,
  6320	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit is not to be attributed to the forme of Monarchy, but to the ambition
  6321	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Subjects, and ignorance of their Duty. On the other side, there is
  6322	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tno great Common-wealth, the Soveraignty whereof is in a great Assembly,
  6323	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich is not, as to consultations of Peace, and Warre, and making of
  6324	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLawes, in the same condition, as if the Government were in a Child. For
  6325	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas a Child wants the judgement to dissent from counsell given him, and
  6326	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis thereby necessitated to take the advise of them, or him, to whom he
  6327	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis committed: So an Assembly wanteth the liberty, to dissent from the
  6328	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcounsell of the major part, be it good, or bad. And as a Child has need
  6329	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof a Tutor, or Protector, to preserve his Person, and Authority: So also
  6330	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(in great Common-wealths,) the Soveraign Assembly, in all great dangers
  6331	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand troubles, have need of Custodes Libertatis; that is of Dictators, or
  6332	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tProtectors of their Authoritie; which are as much as Temporary Monarchs;
  6333	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto whom for a time, they may commit the entire exercise of their Power;
  6334	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand have (at the end of that time) been oftner deprived thereof, than
  6335	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInfant Kings, by their Protectors, Regents, or any other Tutors.
  6336	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6337	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThough the Kinds of Soveraigntie be, as I have now shewn, but three;
  6338	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat is to say, Monarchie, where one Man has it; or Democracie, where
  6339	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe generall Assembly of Subjects hath it; or Aristocracie, where it is
  6340	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin an Assembly of certain persons nominated, or otherwise distinguished
  6341	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom the rest: Yet he that shall consider the particular Common-wealthes
  6342	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat have been, and are in the world, will not perhaps easily reduce
  6343	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem to three, and may thereby be inclined to think there be other
  6344	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFormes, arising from these mingled together. As for example, Elective
  6345	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKingdomes; where Kings have the Soveraigne Power put into their hands
  6346	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor a time; of Kingdomes, wherein the King hath a power limited: which
  6347	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGovernments, are nevertheless by most Writers called Monarchie. Likewise
  6348	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tif a Popular, or Aristocraticall Common-wealth, subdue an Enemies
  6349	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCountrie, and govern the same, by a President, Procurator, or
  6350	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother Magistrate; this may seeme perhaps at first sight, to be a
  6351	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDemocraticall, or Aristocraticall Government. But it is not so. For
  6352	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tElective Kings, are not Soveraignes, but Ministers of the Soveraigne;
  6353	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnor limited Kings Soveraignes, but Ministers of them that have the
  6354	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraigne Power: nor are those Provinces which are in subjection to a
  6355	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDemocracie, or Aristocracie of another Common-wealth, Democratically, or
  6356	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAristocratically governed, but Monarchically.
  6357	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6358	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd first, concerning an Elective King, whose power is limited to
  6359	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this life, as it is in many places of Christendome at this day; or to
  6360	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcertaine Yeares or Moneths, as the Dictators power amongst the Romans;
  6361	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIf he have Right to appoint his Successor, he is no more Elective but
  6362	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHereditary. But if he have no Power to elect his Successor, then there
  6363	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis some other Man, or Assembly known, which after his decease may elect
  6364	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta new, or else the Common-wealth dieth, and dissolveth with him, and
  6365	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treturneth to the condition of Warre. If it be known who have the power
  6366	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto give the Soveraigntie after his death, it is known also that the
  6367	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraigntie was in them before: For none have right to give that which
  6368	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey have not right to possesse, and keep to themselves, if they think
  6369	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgood. But if there be none that can give the Soveraigntie, after the
  6370	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdecease of him that was first elected; then has he power, nay he is
  6371	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobliged by the Law of Nature, to provide, by establishing his Successor,
  6372	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto keep those that had trusted him with the Government, from relapsing
  6373	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinto the miserable condition of Civill warre. And consequently he was,
  6374	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhen elected, a Soveraign absolute.
  6375	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6376	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSecondly, that King whose power is limited, is not superiour to him, or
  6377	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem that have the power to limit it; and he that is not superiour, is
  6378	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot supreme; that is to say not Soveraign. The Soveraignty therefore
  6379	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas alwaies in that Assembly which had the Right to Limit him; and
  6380	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby consequence the government not Monarchy, but either Democracy, or
  6381	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAristocracy; as of old time in Sparta; where the Kings had a priviledge
  6382	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto lead their Armies; but the Soveraignty was in the Ephori.
  6383	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6384	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThirdly, whereas heretofore the Roman People, governed the land of Judea
  6385	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(for example) by a President; yet was not Judea therefore a Democracy;
  6386	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbecause they were not governed by any Assembly, into which, any of
  6387	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem, had right to enter; nor by an Aristocracy; because they were
  6388	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot governed by any Assembly, into which, any man could enter by their
  6389	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tElection: but they were governed by one Person, which though as to the
  6390	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpeople of Rome was an Assembly of the people, or Democracy; yet as to
  6391	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe people of Judea, which had no right at all of participating in the
  6392	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgovernment, was a Monarch. For though where the people are governed
  6393	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby an Assembly, chosen by themselves out of their own number, the
  6394	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgovernment is called a Democracy, or Aristocracy; yet when they are
  6395	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgoverned by an Assembly, not of their own choosing, 'tis a Monarchy; not
  6396	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof One man, over another man; but of one people, over another people.
  6397	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6398	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6399	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6400	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6401	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf The Right Of Succession
  6402	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6403	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf all these Formes of Government, the matter being mortall, so that not
  6404	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tonely Monarchs, but also whole Assemblies dy, it is necessary for the
  6405	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconservation of the peace of men, that as there was order taken for
  6406	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tan Artificiall Man, so there be order also taken, for an Artificiall
  6407	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEternity of life; without which, men that are governed by an Assembly,
  6408	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshould return into the condition of Warre in every age; and they
  6409	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat are governed by One man, as soon as their Governour dyeth. This
  6410	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tArtificiall Eternity, is that which men call the Right of Succession.
  6411	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6412	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThere is no perfect forme of Government, where the disposing of the
  6413	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSuccession is not in the present Soveraign. For if it be in any other
  6414	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tparticular Man, or private Assembly, it is in a person subject, and may
  6415	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe assumed by the Soveraign at his pleasure; and consequently the Right
  6416	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis in himselfe. And if it be in no particular man, but left to a new
  6417	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tchoyce; then is the Common-wealth dissolved; and the Right is in him
  6418	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat can get it; contrary to the intention of them that did institute
  6419	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Common-wealth, for their perpetuall, and not temporary security.
  6420	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6421	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn a Democracy, the whole Assembly cannot faile, unlesse the Multitude
  6422	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat are to be governed faile. And therefore questions of the right of
  6423	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSuccession, have in that forme of Government no place at all.
  6424	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6425	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn an Aristocracy, when any of the Assembly dyeth, the election of
  6426	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tanother into his room belongeth to the Assembly, as the Soveraign, to
  6427	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhom belongeth the choosing of all Counsellours, and Officers. For that
  6428	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich the Representative doth, as Actor, every one of the Subjects doth,
  6429	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas Author. And though the Soveraign assembly, may give Power to others,
  6430	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto elect new men, for supply of their Court; yet it is still by their
  6431	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAuthority, that the Election is made; and by the same it may (when the
  6432	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpublique shall require it) be recalled.
  6433	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6434	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Present Monarch Hath Right To Dispose Of The Succession The greatest
  6435	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdifficultie about the right of Succession, is in Monarchy: And the
  6436	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdifficulty ariseth from this, that at first sight, it is not manifest
  6437	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twho is to appoint the Successor; nor many times, who it is whom he
  6438	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thath appointed. For in both these cases, there is required a more exact
  6439	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tratiocination, than every man is accustomed to use. As to the question,
  6440	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twho shall appoint the Successor, of a Monarch that hath the Soveraign
  6441	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAuthority; that is to say, (for Elective Kings and Princes have not the
  6442	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign Power in propriety, but in use only,) we are to consider, that
  6443	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teither he that is in possession, has right to dispose of the Succession,
  6444	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor else that right is again in the dissolved Multitude. For the death
  6445	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof him that hath the Soveraign power in propriety, leaves the Multitude
  6446	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twithout any Soveraign at all; that is, without any Representative in
  6447	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhom they should be united, and be capable of doing any one action at
  6448	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall: And therefore they are incapable of Election of any new Monarch;
  6449	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevery man having equall right to submit himselfe to such as he thinks
  6450	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbest able to protect him, or if he can, protect himselfe by his owne
  6451	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsword; which is a returne to Confusion, and to the condition of a War of
  6452	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevery man against every man, contrary to the end for which Monarchy had
  6453	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tits first Institution. Therfore it is manifest, that by the Institution
  6454	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Monarchy, the disposing of the Successor, is alwaies left to the
  6455	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJudgment and Will of the present Possessor.
  6456	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6457	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd for the question (which may arise sometimes) who it is that the
  6458	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMonarch in possession, hath designed to the succession and inheritance
  6459	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof his power; it is determined by his expresse Words, and Testament; or
  6460	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby other tacite signes sufficient.
  6461	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6462	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6463	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6464	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6465	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSuccession Passeth By Expresse Words;
  6466	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6467	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBy expresse Words, or Testament, when it is declared by him in his life
  6468	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttime, viva voce, or by Writing; as the first Emperours of Rome declared
  6469	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twho should be their Heires. For the word Heire does not of it selfe
  6470	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\timply the Children, or nearest Kindred of a man; but whomsoever a man
  6471	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshall any way declare, he would have to succeed him in his Estate.
  6472	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIf therefore a Monarch declare expresly, that such a man shall be his
  6473	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHeire, either by Word or Writing, then is that man immediately after the
  6474	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdecease of his Predecessor, Invested in the right of being Monarch.
  6475	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6476	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6477	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6478	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6479	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOr, By Not Controlling A Custome;
  6480	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6481	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut where Testament, and expresse Words are wanting, other naturall
  6482	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsignes of the Will are to be followed: whereof the one is Custome. And
  6483	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore where the Custome is, that the next of Kindred absolutely
  6484	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsucceedeth, there also the next of Kindred hath right to the Succession;
  6485	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor that, if the will of him that was in posession had been otherwise,
  6486	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the might easily have declared the same in his life time. And likewise
  6487	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhere the Custome is, that the next of the Male Kindred succeedeth,
  6488	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere also the right of Succession is in the next of the Kindred Male,
  6489	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor the same reason. And so it is if the Custome were to advance the
  6490	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFemale. For whatsoever Custome a man may by a word controule, and does
  6491	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot, it is a naturall signe he would have that Custome stand.
  6492	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6493	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6494	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6495	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6496	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOr, By Presumption Of Naturall Affection
  6497	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6498	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut where neither Custome, nor Testament hath preceded, there it is
  6499	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto be understood, First, that a Monarchs will is, that the government
  6500	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tremain Monarchicall; because he hath approved that government in
  6501	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thimselfe. Secondly, that a Child of his own, Male, or Female, be
  6502	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpreferred before any other; because men are presumed to be more enclined
  6503	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby nature, to advance their own children, than the children of other
  6504	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen; and of their own, rather a Male than a Female; because men, are
  6505	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnaturally fitter than women, for actions of labour and danger. Thirdly,
  6506	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhere his own Issue faileth, rather a Brother than a stranger; and so
  6507	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tstill the neerer in bloud, rather than the more remote, because it is
  6508	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talwayes presumed that the neerer of kin, is the neerer in affection; and
  6509	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t'tis evident that a man receives alwayes, by reflexion, the most honour
  6510	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom the greatnesse of his neerest kindred.
  6511	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6512	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6513	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6514	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6515	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo Dispose Of The Succession, Though To A King Of Another Nation,
  6516	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6517	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNot Unlawfull
  6518	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6519	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut if it be lawfull for a Monarch to dispose of the Succession by words
  6520	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Contract, or Testament, men may perhaps object a great inconvenience:
  6521	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor he may sell, or give his Right of governing to a stranger; which,
  6522	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbecause strangers (that is, men not used to live under the same
  6523	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgovernment, not speaking the same language) do commonly undervalue one
  6524	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tanother, may turn to the oppression of his Subjects; which is indeed
  6525	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta great inconvenience; but it proceedeth not necessarily from the
  6526	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsubjection to a strangers government, but from the unskilfulnesse of the
  6527	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGovernours, ignorant of the true rules of Politiques. And therefore
  6528	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Romans when they had subdued many Nations, to make their Government
  6529	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdigestible, were wont to take away that grievance, as much as they
  6530	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthought necessary, by giving sometimes to whole Nations, and sometimes
  6531	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto Principall men of every Nation they conquered, not onely the
  6532	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPrivileges, but also the Name of Romans; and took many of them into the
  6533	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSenate, and Offices of charge, even in the Roman City. And this was it
  6534	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tour most wise King, King James, aymed at, in endeavouring the Union of
  6535	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this two Realms of England and Scotland. Which if he could have obtained,
  6536	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thad in all likelihood prevented the Civill warres, which make both those
  6537	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKingdomes at this present, miserable. It is not therefore any injury to
  6538	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe people, for a Monarch to dispose of the Succession by Will; though
  6539	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby the fault of many Princes, it hath been sometimes found inconvenient.
  6540	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf the lawfulnesse of it, this also is an argument, that whatsoever
  6541	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinconvenience can arrive by giving a Kingdome to a stranger, may arrive
  6542	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talso by so marrying with strangers, as the Right of Succession may
  6543	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdescend upon them: yet this by all men is accounted lawfull.

  6547	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCHAPTER XX. OF DOMINION PATERNALL AND DESPOTICALL
  6548	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6549	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6550	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tA Common-wealth by Acquisition, is that, where the Soveraign Power is
  6551	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tacquired by Force; And it is acquired by force, when men singly, or
  6552	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmany together by plurality of voyces, for fear of death, or bonds, do
  6553	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tauthorise all the actions of that Man, or Assembly, that hath their
  6554	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlives and liberty in his Power.
  6555	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6556	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6557	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6558	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6559	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWherein Different From A Common-wealth By Institution
  6560	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6561	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd this kind of Dominion, or Soveraignty, differeth from Soveraignty by
  6562	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInstitution, onely in this, That men who choose their Soveraign, do it
  6563	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor fear of one another, and not of him whom they Institute: But in this
  6564	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcase, they subject themselves, to him they are afraid of. In both cases
  6565	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey do it for fear: which is to be noted by them, that hold all such
  6566	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCovenants, as proceed from fear of death, or violence, voyd: which if
  6567	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit were true, no man, in any kind of Common-wealth, could be obliged
  6568	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto Obedience. It is true, that in a Common-wealth once Instituted, or
  6569	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tacquired, Promises proceeding from fear of death, or violence, are no
  6570	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCovenants, nor obliging, when the thing promised is contrary to the
  6571	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLawes; But the reason is not, because it was made upon fear, but because
  6572	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the that promiseth, hath no right in the thing promised. Also, when he
  6573	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmay lawfully performe, and doth not, it is not the Invalidity of
  6574	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Covenant, that absolveth him, but the Sentence of the Soveraign.
  6575	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOtherwise, whensoever a man lawfully promiseth, he unlawfully breaketh:
  6576	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut when the Soveraign, who is the Actor, acquitteth him, then he is
  6577	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tacquitted by him that exorted the promise, as by the Author of such
  6578	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tabsolution.

  6585	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut the Rights, and Consequences of Soveraignty, are the same in both.
  6586	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHis Power cannot, without his consent, be Transferred to another: He
  6587	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcannot Forfeit it: He cannot be Accused by any of his Subjects, of
  6588	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInjury: He cannot be Punished by them: He is Judge of what is necessary
  6589	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor Peace; and Judge of Doctrines: He is Sole Legislator; and Supreme
  6590	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJudge of Controversies; and of the Times, and Occasions of Warre,
  6591	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Peace: to him it belongeth to choose Magistrates, Counsellours,
  6592	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommanders, and all other Officers, and Ministers; and to determine of
  6593	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRewards, and punishments, Honour, and Order. The reasons whereof, are
  6594	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe same which are alledged in the precedent Chapter, for the same
  6595	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRights, and Consequences of Soveraignty by Institution.

  6599	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6600	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDominion Paternall How Attained Not By Generation, But By Contract
  6601	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6602	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDominion is acquired two wayes; By Generation, and by Conquest. The
  6603	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tright of Dominion by Generation, is that, which the Parent hath over
  6604	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this Children; and is called PATERNALL. And is not so derived from the
  6605	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGeneration, as if therefore the Parent had Dominion over his Child
  6606	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbecause he begat him; but from the Childs Consent, either expresse, or
  6607	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby other sufficient arguments declared. For as to the Generation, God
  6608	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thath ordained to man a helper; and there be alwayes two that are equally
  6609	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tParents: the Dominion therefore over the Child, should belong equally to
  6610	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tboth; and he be equally subject to both, which is impossible; for no man
  6611	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcan obey two Masters. And whereas some have attributed the Dominion to
  6612	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Man onely, as being of the more excellent Sex; they misreckon in it.
  6613	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor there is not always that difference of strength or prudence between
  6614	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe man and the woman, as that the right can be determined without War.
  6615	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn Common-wealths, this controversie is decided by the Civill Law: and
  6616	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor the most part, (but not alwayes) the sentence is in favour of the
  6617	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFather; because for the most part Common-wealths have been erected by
  6618	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Fathers, not by the Mothers of families. But the question lyeth
  6619	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnow in the state of meer Nature; where there are supposed no lawes
  6620	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Matrimony; no lawes for the Education of Children; but the Law of
  6621	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNature, and the naturall inclination of the Sexes, one to another, and
  6622	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto their children. In this condition of meer Nature, either the Parents
  6623	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbetween themselves dispose of the dominion over the Child by Contract;
  6624	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor do not dispose thereof at all. If they dispose thereof, the right
  6625	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpasseth according to the Contract. We find in History that the Amazons
  6626	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tContracted with the Men of the neighbouring Countries, to whom they had
  6627	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trecourse for issue, that the issue Male should be sent back, but the
  6628	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFemale remain with themselves: so that the dominion of the Females was
  6629	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the Mother.
  6630	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6631	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6632	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6633	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6634	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOr Education;
  6635	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6636	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIf there be no Contract, the Dominion is in the Mother. For in the
  6637	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcondition of Meer Nature, where there are no Matrimoniall lawes, it
  6638	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcannot be known who is the Father, unlesse it be declared by the Mother:
  6639	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand therefore the right of Dominion over the Child dependeth on her
  6640	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twill, and is consequently hers. Again, seeing the Infant is first in the
  6641	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpower of the Mother; so as she may either nourish, or expose it, if she
  6642	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnourish it, it oweth its life to the Mother; and is therefore obliged to
  6643	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobey her, rather than any other; and by consequence the Dominion over
  6644	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit is hers. But if she expose it, and another find, and nourish it, the
  6645	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDominion is in him that nourisheth it. For it ought to obey him by whom
  6646	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit is preserved; because preservation of life being the end, for which
  6647	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tone man becomes subject to another, every man is supposed to promise
  6648	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobedience, to him, in whose power it is to save, or destroy him.

  6653	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOr Precedent Subjection Of One Of The Parents To The Other
  6654	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6655	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIf the Mother be the Fathers subject, the Child, is in the Fathers
  6656	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpower: and if the Father be the Mothers subject, (as when a Soveraign
  6657	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tQueen marrieth one of her subjects,) the Child is subject to the Mother;
  6658	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbecause the Father also is her subject.
  6659	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6660	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIf a man and a woman, Monarches of two severall Kingdomes, have a Child,
  6661	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand contract concerning who shall have the Dominion of him, the Right of
  6662	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Dominion passeth by the Contract. If they contract not, the Dominion
  6663	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfolloweth the Dominion of the place of his residence. For the Soveraign
  6664	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof each Country hath Dominion over all that reside therein.
  6665	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6666	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHe that hath the Dominion over the Child, hath Dominion also over their
  6667	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChildrens Children. For he that hath Dominion over the person of a man,
  6668	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thath Dominion over all that is his; without which, Dominion were but a
  6669	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTitle, without the effect.

  6684	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6685	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDominion acquired by Conquest, or Victory in war, is that which some
  6686	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWriters call DESPOTICALL, from Despotes, which signifieth a Lord, or
  6687	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMaster; and is the Dominion of the Master over his Servant. And this
  6688	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDominion is then acquired to the Victor, when the Vanquished, to avoyd
  6689	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe present stroke of death, covenanteth either in expresse words, or by
  6690	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother sufficient signes of the Will, that so long as his life, and
  6691	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe liberty of his body is allowed him, the Victor shall have the use
  6692	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthereof, at his pleasure. And after such Covenant made, the Vanquished
  6693	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis a SERVANT, and not before: for by the word Servant (whether it be
  6694	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tderived from Servire, to Serve, or from Servare, to Save, which I leave
  6695	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto Grammarians to dispute) is not meant a Captive, which is kept in
  6696	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprison, or bonds, till the owner of him that took him, or bought him
  6697	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof one that did, shall consider what to do with him: (for such men,
  6698	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(commonly called Slaves,) have no obligation at all; but may break their
  6699	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbonds, or the prison; and kill, or carry away captive their Master,
  6700	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tjustly:) but one, that being taken, hath corporall liberty allowed him;
  6701	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand upon promise not to run away, nor to do violence to his Master, is
  6702	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttrusted by him.
  6703	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6704	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6705	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6706	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6707	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNot By The Victory, But By The Consent Of The Vanquished
  6708	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6709	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIt is not therefore the Victory, that giveth the right of Dominion over
  6710	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Vanquished, but his own Covenant. Nor is he obliged because he is
  6711	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConquered; that is to say, beaten, and taken, or put to flight; but
  6712	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbecause he commeth in, and submitteth to the Victor; Nor is the Victor
  6713	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobliged by an enemies rendring himselfe, (without promise of life,) to
  6714	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tspare him for this his yeelding to discretion; which obliges not the
  6715	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tVictor longer, than in his own discretion hee shall think fit.
  6716	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6717	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd that men do, when they demand (as it is now called) Quarter, (which
  6718	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Greeks called Zogria, taking alive,) is to evade the present fury of
  6719	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Victor, by Submission, and to compound for their life, with Ransome,
  6720	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor Service: and therefore he that hath Quarter, hath not his life given,
  6721	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut deferred till farther deliberation; For it is not an yeelding on
  6722	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcondition of life, but to discretion. And then onely is his life in
  6723	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsecurity, and his service due, when the Victor hath trusted him with his
  6724	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcorporall liberty. For Slaves that work in Prisons, or Fetters, do it
  6725	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot of duty, but to avoyd the cruelty of their task-masters.
  6726	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6727	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Master of the Servant, is Master also of all he hath; and may exact
  6728	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe use thereof; that is to say, of his goods, of his labour, of his
  6729	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tservants, and of his children, as often as he shall think fit. For he
  6730	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tholdeth his life of his Master, by the covenant of obedience; that is,
  6731	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof owning, and authorising whatsoever the Master shall do. And in case
  6732	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Master, if he refuse, kill him, or cast him into bonds, or otherwise
  6733	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpunish him for his disobedience, he is himselfe the author of the same;
  6734	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand cannot accuse him of injury.
  6735	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6736	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn summe the Rights and Consequences of both Paternall and Despoticall
  6737	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDominion, are the very same with those of a Soveraign by Institution;
  6738	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand for the same reasons: which reasons are set down in the precedent
  6739	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tchapter. So that for a man that is Monarch of divers Nations, whereof he
  6740	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thath, in one the Soveraignty by Institution of the people assembled, and
  6741	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin another by Conquest, that is by the Submission of each particular,
  6742	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto avoyd death or bonds; to demand of one Nation more than of the other,
  6743	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom the title of Conquest, as being a Conquered Nation, is an act of
  6744	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tignorance of the Rights of Soveraignty. For the Soveraign is absolute
  6745	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tover both alike; or else there is no Soveraignty at all; and so every
  6746	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman may Lawfully protect himselfe, if he can, with his own sword, which
  6747	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis the condition of war.
  6748	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6749	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t

  6751	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6752	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDifference Between A Family And A Kingdom
  6753	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6754	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBy this it appears, that a great Family if it be not part of some
  6755	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth, is of it self, as to the Rights of Soveraignty, a little
  6756	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMonarchy; whether that Family consist of a man and his children; or of
  6757	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta man and his servants; or of a man, and his children, and servants
  6758	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttogether: wherein the Father of Master is the Soveraign. But yet a
  6759	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFamily is not properly a Common-wealth; unlesse it be of that power by
  6760	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tits own number, or by other opportunities, as not to be subdued without
  6761	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe hazard of war. For where a number of men are manifestly too weak to
  6762	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdefend themselves united, every one may use his own reason in time of
  6763	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdanger, to save his own life, either by flight, or by submission to
  6764	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe enemy, as hee shall think best; in the same manner as a very small
  6765	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcompany of souldiers, surprised by an army, may cast down their armes,
  6766	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand demand quarter, or run away, rather than be put to the sword. And
  6767	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthus much shall suffice; concerning what I find by speculation, and
  6768	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdeduction, of Soveraign Rights, from the nature, need, and designes
  6769	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof men, in erecting of Commonwealths, and putting themselves under
  6770	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMonarchs, or Assemblies, entrusted with power enough for their

  6776	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Right Of Monarchy From Scripture
  6777	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6778	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLet us now consider what the Scripture teacheth in the same point. To
  6779	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMoses, the children of Israel say thus. (Exod. 20. 19) "Speak thou to
  6780	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tus, and we will heare thee; but let not God speak to us, lest we dye."
  6781	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThis is absolute obedience to Moses. Concerning the Right of Kings, God
  6782	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thimself by the mouth of Samuel, saith, (1 Sam. 8. 11, 12, &c.) "This
  6783	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshall be the Right of the King you will have to reigne over you. He
  6784	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshall take your sons, and set them to drive his Chariots, and to be his
  6785	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thorsemen, and to run before his chariots; and gather in his harvest; and
  6786	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto make his engines of War, and Instruments of his chariots; and shall
  6787	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttake your daughters to make perfumes, to be his Cookes, and Bakers. He
  6788	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshall take your fields, your vine-yards, and your olive-yards, and give
  6789	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem to his servants. He shall take the tyth of your corne and wine, and
  6790	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgive it to the men of his chamber, and to his other servants. He shall
  6791	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttake your man-servants, and your maid-servants, and the choice of your
  6792	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tyouth, and employ them in his businesse. He shall take the tyth of your
  6793	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tflocks; and you shall be his servants." This is absolute power, and
  6794	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsummed up in the last words, "you shall be his servants." Againe, when
  6795	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe people heard what power their King was to have, yet they consented
  6796	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthereto, and say thus, (Verse. 19 &c.) "We will be as all other nations,
  6797	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand our King shall judge our causes, and goe before us, to conduct our
  6798	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twars." Here is confirmed the Right that Soveraigns have, both to the
  6799	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMilitia, and to all Judicature; in which is conteined as absolute power,
  6800	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas one man can possibly transferre to another. Again, the prayer of
  6801	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKing Salomon to God, was this. (1 Kings 3. 9) "Give to thy servant
  6802	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunderstanding, to judge thy people, and to discerne between Good and
  6803	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEvill." It belongeth therefore to the Soveraigne to bee Judge, and
  6804	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto praescribe the Rules of Discerning Good and Evill; which Rules are
  6805	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLawes; and therefore in him is the Legislative Power. Saul sought
  6806	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe life of David; yet when it was in his power to slay Saul, and his
  6807	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tServants would have done it, David forbad them, saying (1 Sam. 24. 9)
  6808	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"God forbid I should do such an act against my Lord, the anoynted of
  6809	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod." For obedience of servants St. Paul saith, (Coll. 3. 20) "Servants
  6810	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobey your masters in All things," and, (Verse. 22) "Children obey your
  6811	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tParents in All things." There is simple obedience in those that are
  6812	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsubject to Paternall, or Despoticall Dominion. Again, (Math. 23. 2,3)
  6813	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"The Scribes and Pharisees sit in Moses chayre and therefore All that
  6814	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey shall bid you observe, that observe and do." There again is simple
  6815	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobedience. And St. Paul, (Tit. 3. 2) "Warn them that they subject
  6816	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthemselves to Princes, and to those that are in Authority, & obey
  6817	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem." This obedience is also simple. Lastly, our Saviour himselfe
  6818	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tacknowledges, that men ought to pay such taxes as are by Kings imposed,
  6819	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhere he sayes, "Give to Caesar that which is Caesars;" and payed such
  6820	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttaxes himselfe. And that the Kings word, is sufficient to take any thing
  6821	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom any subject, when there is need; and that the King is Judge of that
  6822	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tneed: For he himselfe, as King of the Jewes, commanded his Disciples to
  6823	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttake the Asse, and Asses Colt to carry him into Jerusalem, saying, (Mat.
  6824	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t21. 2,3) "Go into the Village over against you, and you shall find a
  6825	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshee Asse tyed, and her Colt with her, unty them, and bring them to me.
  6826	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd if any man ask you, what you mean by it, Say the Lord hath need
  6827	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof them: And they will let them go." They will not ask whether his
  6828	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnecessity be a sufficient title; nor whether he be judge of that
  6829	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnecessity; but acquiesce in the will of the Lord.
  6830	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6831	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo these places may be added also that of Genesis, (Gen. 3. 5) "You
  6832	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshall be as Gods, knowing Good and Evill." and verse 11. "Who told thee
  6833	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat thou wast naked? hast thou eaten of the tree, of which I commanded
  6834	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthee thou shouldest not eat?" For the Cognisance of Judicature of Good
  6835	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Evill, being forbidden by the name of the fruit of the tree of
  6836	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKnowledge, as a triall of Adams obedience; The Divell to enflame the
  6837	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAmbition of the woman, to whom that fruit already seemed beautifull,
  6838	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttold her that by tasting it, they should be as Gods, knowing Good and
  6839	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEvill. Whereupon having both eaten, they did indeed take upon them
  6840	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGods office, which is Judicature of Good and Evill; but acquired no new
  6841	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tability to distinguish between them aright. And whereas it is sayd, that
  6842	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thaving eaten, they saw they were naked; no man hath so interpreted that
  6843	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tplace, as if they had formerly blind, as saw not their own skins: the
  6844	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmeaning is plain, that it was then they first judged their nakednesse
  6845	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(wherein it was Gods will to create them) to be uncomely; and by being
  6846	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tashamed, did tacitely censure God himselfe. And thereupon God saith,
  6847	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"Hast thou eaten, &c." as if he should say, doest thou that owest me
  6848	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobedience, take upon thee to judge of my Commandements? Whereby it is
  6849	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcleerly, (though Allegorically,) signified, that the Commands of
  6850	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem that have the right to command, are not by their Subjects to be
  6851	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcensured, nor disputed.
  6852	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6853	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6854	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6855	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6856	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign Power Ought In All Common-wealths To Be Absolute
  6857	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6858	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSo it appeareth plainly, to my understanding, both from Reason, and
  6859	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tScripture, that the Soveraign Power, whether placed in One Man, as in
  6860	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMonarchy, or in one Assembly of men, as in Popular, and Aristocraticall
  6861	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealths, is as great, as possibly men can be imagined to make
  6862	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit. And though of so unlimited a Power, men may fancy many evill
  6863	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsequences, yet the consequences of the want of it, which is
  6864	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tperpetuall warre of every man against his neighbour, are much worse. The
  6865	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcondition of man in this life shall never be without Inconveniences; but
  6866	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere happeneth in no Common-wealth any great Inconvenience, but what
  6867	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tproceeds from the Subjects disobedience, and breach of those Covenants,
  6868	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom which the Common-wealth had its being. And whosoever thinking
  6869	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign Power too great, will seek to make it lesse; must subject
  6870	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thimselfe, to the Power, that can limit it; that is to say, to a greater.
  6871	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6872	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe greatest objection is, that of the Practise; when men ask, where,
  6873	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand when, such Power has by Subjects been acknowledged. But one may
  6874	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\task them again, when, or where has there been a Kingdome long free from
  6875	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSedition and Civill Warre. In those Nations, whose Common-wealths have
  6876	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeen long-lived, and not been destroyed, but by forraign warre, the
  6877	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSubjects never did dispute of the Soveraign Power. But howsoever, an
  6878	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\targument for the Practise of men, that have not sifted to the bottom,
  6879	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand with exact reason weighed the causes, and nature of Common-wealths,
  6880	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand suffer daily those miseries, that proceed from the ignorance
  6881	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthereof, is invalid. For though in all places of the world, men should
  6882	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlay the foundation of their houses on the sand, it could not thence be
  6883	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinferred, that so it ought to be. The skill of making, and maintaining
  6884	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealths, consisteth in certain Rules, as doth Arithmetique and
  6885	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGeometry; not (as Tennis-play) on Practise onely: which Rules, neither
  6886	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpoor men have the leisure, nor men that have had the leisure, have
  6887	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thitherto had the curiosity, or the method to find out.

  6893	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6894	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6895	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6896	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLiberty What
  6897	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6898	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLiberty, or FREEDOME, signifieth (properly) the absence of Opposition;
  6899	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(by Opposition, I mean externall Impediments of motion;) and may
  6900	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe applyed no lesse to Irrational, and Inanimate creatures, than to
  6901	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRationall. For whatsoever is so tyed, or environed, as it cannot move,
  6902	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut within a certain space, which space is determined by the opposition
  6903	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof some externall body, we say it hath not Liberty to go further. And
  6904	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tso of all living creatures, whilest they are imprisoned, or restrained,
  6905	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith walls, or chayns; and of the water whilest it is kept in by banks,
  6906	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor vessels, that otherwise would spread it selfe into a larger space, we
  6907	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tuse to say, they are not at Liberty, to move in such manner, as without
  6908	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose externall impediments they would. But when the impediment of
  6909	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmotion, is in the constitution of the thing it selfe, we use not to
  6910	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsay, it wants the Liberty; but the Power to move; as when a stone lyeth
  6911	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tstill, or a man is fastned to his bed by sicknesse.
  6912	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6913	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6914	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6915	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6916	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhat It Is To Be Free
  6917	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6918	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd according to this proper, and generally received meaning of the
  6919	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tword, A FREE-MAN, is "he, that in those things, which by his strength
  6920	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand wit he is able to do, is not hindred to doe what he has a will
  6921	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto." But when the words Free, and Liberty, are applyed to any thing but
  6922	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBodies, they are abused; for that which is not subject to Motion, is not
  6923	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsubject to Impediment: And therefore, when 'tis said (for example) The
  6924	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tway is free, no liberty of the way is signified, but of those that walk
  6925	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin it without stop. And when we say a Guift is free, there is not meant
  6926	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tany liberty of the Guift, but of the Giver, that was not bound by any
  6927	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlaw, or Covenant to give it. So when we Speak Freely, it is not the
  6928	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tliberty of voice, or pronunciation, but of the man, whom no law hath
  6929	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobliged to speak otherwise then he did. Lastly, from the use of the
  6930	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tword Freewill, no liberty can be inferred to the will, desire, or
  6931	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinclination, but the liberty of the man; which consisteth in this, that
  6932	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the finds no stop, in doing what he has the will, desire, or inclination
  6933	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto doe.

  6937	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6938	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFeare And Liberty Consistent
  6939	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6940	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFeare and Liberty are consistent; as when a man throweth his goods into
  6941	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Sea for Feare the ship should sink, he doth it neverthelesse very
  6942	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twillingly, and may refuse to doe it if he will: It is therefore the
  6943	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\taction, of one that was Free; so a man sometimes pays his debt, only for
  6944	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFeare of Imprisonment, which because no body hindred him from detaining,
  6945	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas the action of a man at Liberty. And generally all actions which men
  6946	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdoe in Common-wealths, for Feare of the law, or actions, which the doers
  6947	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thad Liberty to omit.
  6948	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6949	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6950	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6951	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6952	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLiberty And Necessity Consistent
  6953	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6954	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLiberty and Necessity are Consistent: As in the water, that hath not
  6955	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tonly Liberty, but a Necessity of descending by the Channel: so likewise
  6956	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the Actions which men voluntarily doe; which (because they proceed
  6957	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom their will) proceed from Liberty; and yet because every act of
  6958	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmans will, and every desire, and inclination proceedeth from some cause,
  6959	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich causes in a continuall chaine (whose first link in the hand of
  6960	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod the first of all causes) proceed from Necessity. So that to him
  6961	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat could see the connexion of those causes, the Necessity of all
  6962	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmens voluntary actions, would appeare manifest. And therefore God, that
  6963	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tseeth, and disposeth all things, seeth also that the Liberty of man
  6964	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin doing what he will, is accompanied with the Necessity of doing that
  6965	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich God will, & no more, nor lesse. For though men may do many things,
  6966	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich God does not command, nor is therefore Author of them; yet they
  6967	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcan have no passion, nor appetite to any thing, of which appetite Gods
  6968	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twill is not the cause. And did not his will assure the Necessity of mans
  6969	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twill, and consequently of all that on mans will dependeth, the Liberty
  6970	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof men would be a contradiction, and impediment to the omnipotence and
  6971	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLiberty of God. And this shall suffice, (as to the matter in hand) of
  6972	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat naturall Liberty, which only is properly called Liberty.

  6978	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6979	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut as men, for the atteyning of peace, and conservation of themselves
  6980	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthereby, have made an Artificiall Man, which we call a Common-wealth; so
  6981	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talso have they made Artificiall Chains, called Civill Lawes, which they
  6982	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthemselves, by mutuall covenants, have fastned at one end, to the lips
  6983	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof that Man, or Assembly, to whom they have given the Soveraigne Power;
  6984	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand at the other end to their own Ears. These Bonds in their own nature
  6985	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut weak, may neverthelesse be made to hold, by the danger, though not
  6986	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby the difficulty of breaking them.

  6989	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6990	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6991	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLiberty Of Subjects Consisteth In Liberty From Covenants
  6992	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  6993	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn relation to these Bonds only it is, that I am to speak now, of the
  6994	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLiberty of Subjects. For seeing there is no Common-wealth in the world,
  6995	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor the regulating of all the actions, and words of men, (as being
  6996	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta thing impossible:) it followeth necessarily, that in all kinds of
  6997	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tactions, by the laws praetermitted, men have the Liberty, of doing what
  6998	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir own reasons shall suggest, for the most profitable to themselves.
  6999	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor if wee take Liberty in the proper sense, for corporall Liberty; that
  7000	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis to say, freedome from chains, and prison, it were very absurd for men
  7001	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto clamor as they doe, for the Liberty they so manifestly enjoy. Againe,
  7002	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tif we take Liberty, for an exemption from Lawes, it is no lesse absurd,
  7003	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor men to demand as they doe, that Liberty, by which all other men may
  7004	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe masters of their lives. And yet as absurd as it is, this is it they
  7005	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdemand; not knowing that the Lawes are of no power to protect them,
  7006	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twithout a Sword in the hands of a man, or men, to cause those laws to
  7007	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe put in execution. The Liberty of a Subject, lyeth therefore only
  7008	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin those things, which in regulating their actions, the Soveraign hath
  7009	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpraetermitted; such as is the Liberty to buy, and sell, and otherwise
  7010	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontract with one another; to choose their own aboad, their own diet,
  7011	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir own trade of life, and institute their children as they themselves
  7012	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthink fit; & the like.
  7013	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7014	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7015	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7016	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7017	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLiberty Of The Subject Consistent With Unlimited Power Of The Soveraign
  7018	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7019	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNeverthelesse we are not to understand, that by such Liberty, the
  7020	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign Power of life, and death, is either abolished, or limited. For
  7021	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit has been already shewn, that nothing the Soveraign Representative
  7022	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcan doe to a Subject, on what pretence soever, can properly be called
  7023	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInjustice, or Injury; because every Subject is Author of every act the
  7024	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign doth; so that he never wanteth Right to any thing, otherwise,
  7025	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthan as he himself is the Subject of God, and bound thereby to observe
  7026	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe laws of Nature. And therefore it may, and doth often happen in
  7027	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealths, that a Subject may be put to death, by the command of
  7028	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Soveraign Power; and yet neither doe the other wrong: as when Jeptha
  7029	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcaused his daughter to be sacrificed: In which, and the like cases,
  7030	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the that so dieth, had Liberty to doe the action, for which he is
  7031	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tneverthelesse, without Injury put to death. And the same holdeth also
  7032	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin a Soveraign Prince, that putteth to death an Innocent Subject. For
  7033	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthough the action be against the law of Nature, as being contrary to
  7034	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEquitie, (as was the killing of Uriah, by David;) yet it was not an
  7035	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInjurie to Uriah; but to God. Not to Uriah, because the right to doe
  7036	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhat he pleased, was given him by Uriah himself; And yet to God, because
  7037	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDavid was Gods Subject; and prohibited all Iniquitie by the law of
  7038	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNature. Which distinction, David himself, when he repented the fact,
  7039	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevidently confirmed, saying, "To thee only have I sinned." In the same
  7040	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmanner, the people of Athens, when they banished the most potent of
  7041	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir Common-wealth for ten years, thought they committed no Injustice;
  7042	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand yet they never questioned what crime he had done; but what hurt he
  7043	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twould doe: Nay they commanded the banishment of they knew not whom; and
  7044	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevery Citizen bringing his Oystershell into the market place, written
  7045	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith the name of him he desired should be banished, without actuall
  7046	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\taccusing him, sometimes banished an Aristides, for his reputation of
  7047	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJustice; And sometimes a scurrilous Jester, as Hyperbolus, to make a
  7048	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJest of it. And yet a man cannot say, the Soveraign People of Athens
  7049	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twanted right to banish them; or an Athenian the Libertie to Jest, or to
  7050	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe Just.

  7055	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Liberty Which Writers Praise, Is The Liberty Of Soveraigns;
  7056	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7057	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNot Of Private Men
  7058	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7059	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Libertie, whereof there is so frequent, and honourable mention, in
  7060	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Histories, and Philosophy of the Antient Greeks, and Romans, and in
  7061	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe writings, and discourse of those that from them have received all
  7062	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir learning in the Politiques, is not the Libertie of Particular
  7063	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen; but the Libertie of the Common-wealth: which is the same with
  7064	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat, which every man then should have, if there were no Civil Laws,
  7065	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnor Common-wealth at all. And the effects of it also be the same. For as
  7066	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tamongst masterlesse men, there is perpetuall war, of every man against
  7067	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this neighbour; no inheritance, to transmit to the Son, nor to expect
  7068	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom the Father; no propriety of Goods, or Lands; no security; but a
  7069	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfull and absolute Libertie in every Particular man: So in States, and
  7070	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealths not dependent on one another, every Common-wealth, (not
  7071	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevery man) has an absolute Libertie, to doe what it shall judge (that is
  7072	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto say, what that Man, or Assemblie that representeth it, shall judge)
  7073	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmost conducing to their benefit. But withall, they live in the condition
  7074	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof a perpetuall war, and upon the confines of battel, with their
  7075	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrontiers armed, and canons planted against their neighbours
  7076	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tround about. The Athenians, and Romanes, were free; that is, free
  7077	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealths: not that any particular men had the Libertie to resist
  7078	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir own Representative; but that their Representative had the Libertie
  7079	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto resist, or invade other people. There is written on the Turrets of
  7080	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe city of Luca in great characters at this day, the word LIBERTAS; yet
  7081	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tno man can thence inferre, that a particular man has more Libertie,
  7082	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor Immunitie from the service of the Commonwealth there, than in
  7083	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConstantinople. Whether a Common-wealth be Monarchicall, or Popular, the
  7084	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFreedome is still the same.
  7085	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7086	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut it is an easy thing, for men to be deceived, by the specious name
  7087	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Libertie; and for want of Judgement to distinguish, mistake that for
  7088	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir Private Inheritance, and Birth right, which is the right of the
  7089	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPublique only. And when the same errour is confirmed by the authority of
  7090	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen in reputation for their writings in this subject, it is no wonder if
  7091	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit produce sedition, and change of Government. In these westerne
  7092	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tparts of the world, we are made to receive our opinions concerning the
  7093	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInstitution, and Rights of Common-wealths, from Aristotle, Cicero, and
  7094	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother men, Greeks and Romanes, that living under Popular States, derived
  7095	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose Rights, not from the Principles of Nature, but transcribed them
  7096	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinto their books, out of the Practice of their own Common-wealths, which
  7097	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere Popular; as the Grammarians describe the Rules of Language, out of
  7098	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Practise of the time; or the Rules of Poetry, out of the Poems of
  7099	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHomer and Virgil. And because the Athenians were taught, (to keep them
  7100	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom desire of changing their Government,) that they were Freemen, and
  7101	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall that lived under Monarchy were slaves; therefore Aristotle puts it
  7102	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdown in his Politiques,(lib.6.cap.2) "In democracy, Liberty is to be
  7103	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsupposed: for 'tis commonly held, that no man is Free in any other
  7104	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGovernment." And as Aristotle; so Cicero, and other Writers have
  7105	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgrounded their Civill doctrine, on the opinions of the Romans, who were
  7106	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttaught to hate Monarchy, at first, by them that having deposed their
  7107	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign, shared amongst them the Soveraignty of Rome; and afterwards
  7108	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby their Successors. And by reading of these Greek, and Latine Authors,
  7109	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen from their childhood have gotten a habit (under a false shew of
  7110	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLiberty,) of favouring tumults, and of licentious controlling the
  7111	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tactions of their Soveraigns; and again of controlling those controllers,
  7112	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith the effusion of so much blood; as I think I may truly say, there
  7113	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas never any thing so deerly bought, as these Western parts have bought
  7114	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe learning of the Greek and Latine tongues.

  7119	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLiberty Of The Subject How To Be Measured
  7120	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7121	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo come now to the particulars of the true Liberty of a Subject; that is
  7122	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto say, what are the things, which though commanded by the Soveraign, he
  7123	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmay neverthelesse, without Injustice, refuse to do; we are to consider,
  7124	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhat Rights we passe away, when we make a Common-wealth; or (which is
  7125	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall one,) what Liberty we deny our selves, by owning all the Actions
  7126	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(without exception) of the Man, or Assembly we make our Soveraign. For
  7127	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the act of our Submission, consisteth both our Obligation, and
  7128	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tour Liberty; which must therefore be inferred by arguments taken from
  7129	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthence; there being no Obligation on any man, which ariseth not from
  7130	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsome Act of his own; for all men equally, are by Nature Free. And
  7131	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbecause such arguments, must either be drawn from the expresse words, "I
  7132	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAuthorise all his Actions," or from the Intention of him that submitteth
  7133	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thimselfe to his Power, (which Intention is to be understood by the End
  7134	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor which he so submitteth;) The Obligation, and Liberty of the Subject,
  7135	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis to be derived, either from those Words, (or others equivalent;) or
  7136	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\telse from the End of the Institution of Soveraignty; namely, the Peace
  7137	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Subjects within themselves, and their Defence against a common
  7138	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEnemy.
  7139	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7140	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7141	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7142	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7143	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSubjects Have Liberty To Defend Their Own Bodies,
  7144	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7145	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEven Against Them That Lawfully Invade Them
  7146	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7147	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFirst therefore, seeing Soveraignty by Institution, is by Covenant of
  7148	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevery one to every one; and Soveraignty by Acquisition, by Covenants of
  7149	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Vanquished to the Victor, or Child to the Parent; It is manifest,
  7150	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat every Subject has Liberty in all those things, the right whereof
  7151	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcannot by Covenant be transferred. I have shewn before in the 14.
  7152	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChapter, that Covenants, not to defend a mans own body, are voyd.
  7153	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTherefore,
  7154	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7155	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7156	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7157	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7158	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAre Not Bound To Hurt Themselves;
  7159	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7160	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIf the Soveraign command a man (though justly condemned,) to kill,
  7161	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twound, or mayme himselfe; or not to resist those that assault him; or
  7162	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto abstain from the use of food, ayre, medicine, or any other thing,
  7163	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twithout which he cannot live; yet hath that man the Liberty to disobey.
  7164	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7165	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIf a man be interrogated by the Soveraign, or his Authority, concerning
  7166	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta crime done by himselfe, he is not bound (without assurance of Pardon)
  7167	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto confesse it; because no man (as I have shewn in the same Chapter) can
  7168	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe obliged by Covenant to accuse himselfe.
  7169	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7170	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAgain, the Consent of a Subject to Soveraign Power, is contained in
  7171	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthese words, "I Authorise, or take upon me, all his actions;" in which
  7172	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere is no restriction at all, of his own former naturall Liberty:
  7173	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor by allowing him to Kill Me, I am not bound to Kill my selfe when
  7174	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the commands me. "'Tis one thing to say 'Kill me, or my fellow, if you
  7175	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tplease;' another thing to say, 'I will kill my selfe, or my fellow.'" It
  7176	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfolloweth therefore, that
  7177	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7178	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNo man is bound by the words themselves, either to kill himselfe, or
  7179	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tany other man; And consequently, that the Obligation a man may sometimes
  7180	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave, upon the Command of the Soveraign to execute any dangerous, or
  7181	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdishonourable Office, dependeth not on the Words of our Submission; but
  7182	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ton the Intention; which is to be understood by the End thereof. When
  7183	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore our refusall to obey, frustrates the End for which the
  7184	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraignty was ordained; then there is no Liberty to refuse: otherwise
  7185	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere is.
  7186	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7187	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7188	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7189	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7190	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNor To Warfare, Unless They Voluntarily Undertake It
  7191	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7192	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tUpon this ground, a man that is commanded as a Souldier to fight against
  7193	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe enemy, though his Soveraign have Right enough to punish his refusall
  7194	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith death, may neverthelesse in many cases refuse, without Injustice;
  7195	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas when he substituteth a sufficient Souldier in his place: for in this
  7196	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcase he deserteth not the service of the Common-wealth. And there is
  7197	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tallowance to be made for naturall timorousnesse, not onely to women, (of
  7198	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhom no such dangerous duty is expected,) but also to men of feminine
  7199	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcourage. When Armies fight, there is on one side, or both, a running
  7200	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\taway; yet when they do it not out of trechery, but fear, they are not
  7201	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\testeemed to do it unjustly, but dishonourably. For the same reason, to
  7202	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tavoyd battell, is not Injustice, but Cowardise. But he that inrowleth
  7203	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thimselfe a Souldier, or taketh imprest mony, taketh away the excuse of
  7204	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta timorous nature; and is obliged, not onely to go to the battell,
  7205	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut also not to run from it, without his Captaines leave. And when the
  7206	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDefence of the Common-wealth, requireth at once the help of all that
  7207	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare able to bear Arms, every one is obliged; because otherwise the
  7208	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInstitution of the Common-wealth, which they have not the purpose, or
  7209	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcourage to preserve, was in vain.
  7210	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7211	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo resist the Sword of the Common-wealth, in defence of another man,
  7212	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tguilty, or innocent, no man hath Liberty; because such Liberty, takes
  7213	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\taway from the Soveraign, the means of Protecting us; and is therefore
  7214	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdestructive of the very essence of Government. But in case a great many
  7215	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen together, have already resisted the Soveraign Power Unjustly, or
  7216	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommitted some Capitall crime, for which every one of them expecteth
  7217	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdeath, whether have they not the Liberty then to joyn together, and
  7218	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tassist, and defend one another? Certainly they have: For they but defend
  7219	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir lives, which the guilty man may as well do, as the Innocent. There
  7220	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas indeed injustice in the first breach of their duty; Their bearing of
  7221	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tArms subsequent to it, though it be to maintain what they have done, is
  7222	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tno new unjust act. And if it be onely to defend their persons, it is not
  7223	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunjust at all. But the offer of Pardon taketh from them, to whom it
  7224	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis offered, the plea of self-defence, and maketh their perseverance in
  7225	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tassisting, or defending the rest, unlawfull.
  7226	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7227	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7228	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7229	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7230	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Greatest Liberty Of Subjects, Dependeth On The Silence Of The Law
  7231	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7232	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7233	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAs for other Lyberties, they depend on the silence of the Law. In cases
  7234	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhere the Soveraign has prescribed no rule, there the Subject hath
  7235	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe liberty to do, or forbeare, according to his own discretion. And
  7236	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore such Liberty is in some places more, and in some lesse; and in
  7237	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsome times more, in other times lesse, according as they that have the
  7238	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraignty shall think most convenient. As for Example, there was
  7239	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta time, when in England a man might enter in to his own Land,
  7240	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(and dispossesse such as wrongfully possessed it) by force. But in
  7241	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tafter-times, that Liberty of Forcible entry, was taken away by a Statute
  7242	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmade (by the King) in Parliament. And is some places of the world, men
  7243	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave the Liberty of many wives: in other places, such Liberty is not
  7244	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tallowed.
  7245	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7246	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIf a Subject have a controversie with his Soveraigne, of Debt, or
  7247	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof right of possession of lands or goods, or concerning any service
  7248	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trequired at his hands, or concerning any penalty corporall, or
  7249	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpecuniary, grounded on a precedent Law; He hath the same Liberty to sue
  7250	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor his right, as if it were against a Subject; and before such Judges,
  7251	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas are appointed by the Soveraign. For seeing the Soveraign demandeth
  7252	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby force of a former Law, and not by vertue of his Power; he declareth
  7253	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthereby, that he requireth no more, than shall appear to be due by that
  7254	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaw. The sute therefore is not contrary to the will of the Soveraign;
  7255	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand consequently the Subject hath the Liberty to demand the hearing of
  7256	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this Cause; and sentence, according to that Law. But if he demand, or
  7257	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttake any thing by pretence of his Power; there lyeth, in that case, no
  7258	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\taction of Law: for all that is done by him in Vertue of his Power, is
  7259	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdone by the Authority of every subject, and consequently, he that brings
  7260	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tan action against the Soveraign, brings it against himselfe.
  7261	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7262	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIf a Monarch, or Soveraign Assembly, grant a Liberty to all, or any of
  7263	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this Subjects; which Grant standing, he is disabled to provide for their
  7264	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsafety, the Grant is voyd; unlesse he directly renounce, or transferre
  7265	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Soveraignty to another. For in that he might openly, (if it had been
  7266	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this will,) and in plain termes, have renounced, or transferred it, and
  7267	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdid not; it is to be understood it was not his will; but that the Grant
  7268	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tproceeded from ignorance of the repugnancy between such a Liberty and
  7269	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Soveraign Power; and therefore the Soveraignty is still retayned;
  7270	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand consequently all those Powers, which are necessary to the exercising
  7271	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthereof; such as are the Power of Warre, and Peace, of Judicature, of
  7272	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tappointing Officers, and Councellours, of levying Mony, and the rest
  7273	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnamed in the 18th Chapter.

  7278	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn What Cases Subjects Absolved Of Their Obedience To Their Soveraign
  7279	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7280	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Obligation of Subjects to the Soveraign is understood to last as
  7281	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlong, and no longer, than the power lasteth, by which he is able to
  7282	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprotect them. For the right men have by Nature to protect themselves,
  7283	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhen none else can protect them, can by no Covenant be relinquished. The
  7284	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraignty is the Soule of the Common-wealth; which once departed from
  7285	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Body, the members doe no more receive their motion from it. The end
  7286	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Obedience is Protection; which, wheresoever a man seeth it, either in
  7287	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this own, or in anothers sword, Nature applyeth his obedience to it, and
  7288	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this endeavour to maintaine it. And though Soveraignty, in the intention
  7289	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof them that make it, be immortall; yet is it in its own nature, not

  7304	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe case is the same, if he be deteined on the same termes, in a

  7360	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Divers Sorts Of Systemes Of People
  7361	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7362	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHaving spoken of the Generation, Forme, and Power of a Common-wealth, I
  7363	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tam in order to speak next of the parts thereof. And first of Systemes,
  7364	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich resemble the similar parts, or Muscles of a Body naturall. By
  7365	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSYSTEMES; I understand any numbers of men joyned in one Interest, or one
  7366	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBusinesse. Of which, some are Regular, and some Irregular. Regular are
  7367	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose, where one Man, or Assembly of men, is constituted Representative
  7368	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the whole number. All other are Irregular.
  7369	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7370	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf Regular, some are Absolute, and Independent, subject to none but
  7371	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir own Representative: such are only Common-wealths; Of which I have
  7372	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tspoken already in the 5. last preceding chapters. Others are Dependent;
  7373	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat is to say, Subordinate to some Soveraign Power, to which every one,
  7374	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas also their Representative is Subject.
  7375	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7376	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf Systemes subordinate, some are Politicall, and some Private.
  7377	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPoliticall (otherwise Called Bodies Politique, and Persons In Law,)
  7378	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare those, which are made by authority from the Soveraign Power of the
  7379	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth. Private, are those, which are constituted by Subjects
  7380	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tamongst themselves, or by authoritie from a stranger. For no authority
  7381	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tderived from forraign power, within the Dominion of another, is Publique
  7382	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere, but Private.
  7383	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7384	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd of Private Systemes, some are Lawfull; some Unlawfull: Lawfull, are
  7385	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose which are allowed by the Common-wealth: all other are Unlawfull.
  7386	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIrregular Systemes, are those which having no Representative,
  7387	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsist only in concourse of People; which if not forbidden by the
  7388	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth, nor made on evill designe, (such as are conflux of People
  7389	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto markets, or shews, or any other harmelesse end,) are Lawfull. But
  7390	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhen the Intention is evill, or (if the number be considerable) unknown,
  7391	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey are Unlawfull.

  7397	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7398	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn Bodies Politique, the power of the Representative is alwaies Limited:
  7399	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd that which prescribeth the limits thereof, is the Power Soveraign.
  7400	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor Power Unlimited, is absolute Soveraignty. And the Soveraign, in
  7401	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevery Commonwealth, is the absolute Representative of all the Subjects;
  7402	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand therefore no other, can be Representative of any part of them,
  7403	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut so far forth, as he shall give leave; And to give leave to a Body
  7404	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPolitique of Subjects, to have an absolute Representative to all
  7405	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tintents and purposes, were to abandon the Government of so much of the
  7406	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommonwealth, and to divide the Dominion, contrary to their Peace and
  7407	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDefence, which the Soveraign cannot be understood to doe, by any Grant,
  7408	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat does not plainly, and directly discharge them of their subjection.
  7409	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor consequences of words, are not the signes of his will, when other
  7410	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsequences are signes of the contrary; but rather signes of errour,
  7411	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand misreckoning; to which all mankind is too prone.
  7412	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7413	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe bounds of that Power, which is given to the Representative of a
  7414	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBodie Politique, are to be taken notice of, from two things. One is
  7415	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir Writt, or Letters from the Soveraign: the other is the Law of the
  7416	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth.

  7422	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7423	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor though in the Institution or Acquisition of a Common-wealth,
  7424	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich is independent, there needs no Writing, because the Power of the
  7425	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRepresentative has there no other bounds, but such as are set out by
  7426	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe unwritten Law of Nature; yet in subordinate bodies, there are such
  7427	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdiversities of Limitation necessary, concerning their businesses, times,
  7428	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand places, as can neither be remembred without Letters, nor taken
  7429	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnotice of, unlesse such Letters be Patent, that they may be read to
  7430	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem, and withall sealed, or testified, with the Seales, or other
  7431	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpermanent signes of the Authority Soveraign.

  7437	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7438	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd because such Limitation is not alwaies easie, or perhaps possible
  7439	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto be described in writing; the ordinary Lawes, common to all Subjects,
  7440	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmust determine, that the Representative may lawfully do, in all Cases,

  7454	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Act of the Soveraign every one is Author, because he is their
  7455	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRepresentative unlimited; and the act of him that recedes not from the
  7456	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLetters of the Soveraign, is the act of the Soveraign, and therefore

  7465	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDecree, not warranted by their Letters, or the Lawes, is the act of the
  7466	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAssembly, or Body Politique, and the act of every one by whose Vote the

  7468	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe contrary; nor of any man absent, unlesse he Voted it by procuration.
  7469	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIt is the act of the Assembly, because Voted by the major part; and if

  7471	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcapable, as by dissolution, or forfeiture of their Letters (which is to
  7472	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch artificiall, and fictitious Bodies, capitall,) or (if the
  7473	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAssembly have a Common stock, wherein none of the Innocent Members have
  7474	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpropriety,) by pecuniary Mulct. For from corporall penalties Nature hath
  7475	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texempted all Bodies Politique. But they that gave not their Vote, are
  7476	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore Innocent, because the Assembly cannot Represent any man in

  7486	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto make the members pay what he borroweth, he should have by consequence

  7562	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAssembly is a Body Politique, and their power limited by Commission.
  7563	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThis word Province signifies a charge, or care of businesse, which he
  7564	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhose businesse it is, committeth to another man, to be administred for,
  7565	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand under him; and therefore when in one Common-wealth there be divers
  7566	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCountries, that have their Lawes distinct one from another, or are farre
  7567	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdistant in place, the Administration of the Government being committed
  7568	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto divers persons, those Countries where the Soveraign is not resident,
  7569	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut governs by Commission, are called Provinces. But of the government
  7570	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof a Province, by an Assembly residing in the Province it selfe, there
  7571	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe few examples. The Romans who had the Soveraignty of many Provinces;
  7572	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tyet governed them alwaies by Presidents, and Praetors; and not by
  7573	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAssemblies, as they governed the City of Rome, and Territories adjacent.
  7574	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn like manner, when there were Colonies sent from England, to Plant
  7575	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tVirginia, and Sommer-Ilands; though the government of them here, were
  7576	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommitted to Assemblies in London, yet did those Assemblies never
  7577	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommit the Government under them to any Assembly there; but did to each
  7578	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPlantation send one Governour; For though every man, where he can be
  7579	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpresent by Nature, desires to participate of government; yet where
  7580	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey cannot be present, they are by Nature also enclined, to commit the
  7581	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGovernment of their common Interest rather to a Monarchicall, then a
  7582	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPopular form of Government: which is also evident in those men that have
  7583	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgreat private estates; who when they are unwilling to take the paines of
  7584	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tadministring the businesse that belongs to them, choose rather to trust
  7585	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tone Servant, than a Assembly either of their friends or servants.
  7586	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut howsoever it be in fact, yet we may suppose the Government of a
  7587	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tProvince, or Colony committed to an Assembly: and when it is, that which
  7588	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin this place I have to say, is this; that whatsoever debt is by that
  7589	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAssembly contracted; or whatsoever unlawfull Act is decreed, is the Act
  7590	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tonely of those that assented, and not of any that dissented, or were
  7591	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tabsent, for the reasons before alledged. Also that an Assembly residing
  7592	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tout of the bounds of that Colony whereof they have the government,
  7593	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcannot execute any power over the persons, or goods of any of the
  7594	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tColonie, to seize on them for debt, or other duty, in any place
  7595	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twithout the Colony it selfe, as having no Jurisdiction, nor Authoritie
  7596	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\telsewhere, but are left to the remedie, which the Law of the place
  7597	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talloweth them. And though the Assembly have right, to impose a Mulct
  7598	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tupon any of their members, that shall break the Lawes they make; yet
  7599	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tout of the Colonie it selfe, they have no right to execute the same.
  7600	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd that which is said here, of the Rights of an Assembly, for the
  7601	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgovernment of a Province, or a Colony, is appliable also to an Assembly
  7602	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor the Government of a Town, or University, or a College, or a Church,
  7603	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor for any other Government over the persons of men.
  7604	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7605	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd generally, in all Bodies Politique, if any particular member
  7606	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconceive himself Injured by the Body it self, the Cognisance of his
  7607	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcause belongeth to the Soveraign, and those the Soveraign hath ordained
  7608	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor Judges in such causes, or shall ordaine for that particular cause;
  7609	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand not to the Body it self. For the whole Body is in this case his
  7610	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfellow subject, which in a Soveraign Assembly, is otherwise: for there,
  7611	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tif the Soveraign be not Judge, though in his own cause, there can be no
  7612	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJudge at all.

  7617	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBodies Politique For Ordering Of Trade
  7618	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7619	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn a Bodie Politique, for the well ordering of forraigne Traffique, the
  7620	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmost commodious Representative is an Assembly of all the members; that
  7621	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis to say, such a one, as every one that adventureth his mony, may be
  7622	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpresent at all the Deliberations, and Resolutions of the Body, if they
  7623	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twill themselves. For proof whereof, we are to consider the end, for
  7624	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich men that are Merchants, and may buy and sell, export, and import
  7625	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir Merchandise, according to their own discretions, doe neverthelesse
  7626	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbind themselves up in one Corporation. It is true, there be few
  7627	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMerchants, that with the Merchandise they buy at home, can fraight a
  7628	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tShip, to export it; or with that they buy abroad, to bring it home; and
  7629	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave therefore need to joyn together in one Society; where every man
  7630	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmay either participate of the gaine, according to the proportion of his
  7631	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tadventure; or take his own; and sell what he transports, or imports, at
  7632	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch prices as he thinks fit. But this is no Body Politique, there being
  7633	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tno Common Representative to oblige them to any other Law, than that
  7634	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich is common to all other subjects. The End of their Incorporating,
  7635	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis to make their gaine the greater; which is done two wayes; by sole
  7636	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbuying, and sole selling, both at home, and abroad. So that to grant
  7637	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto a Company of Merchants to be a Corporation, or Body Politique, is to
  7638	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgrant them a double Monopoly, whereof one is to be sole buyers; another
  7639	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto be sole sellers. For when there is a Company incorporate for any
  7640	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tparticular forraign Country, they only export the Commodities vendible
  7641	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin that Country; which is sole buying at home, and sole selling abroad.
  7642	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor at home there is but one buyer, and abroad but one that selleth:
  7643	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tboth which is gainfull to the Merchant, because thereby they buy at home
  7644	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tat lower, and sell abroad at higher rates: And abroad there is but one
  7645	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbuyer of forraign Merchandise, and but one that sels them at home; both
  7646	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich againe are gainfull to the adventurers.
  7647	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7648	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf this double Monopoly one part is disadvantageous to the people at
  7649	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thome, the other to forraigners. For at home by their sole exportation
  7650	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey set what price they please on the husbandry and handy-works of
  7651	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe people; and by the sole importation, what price they please on all
  7652	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tforraign commodities the people have need of; both which are ill for the
  7653	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpeople. On the contrary, by the sole selling of the native commodities
  7654	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tabroad, and sole buying the forraign commodities upon the place,
  7655	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey raise the price of those, and abate the price of these, to
  7656	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe disadvantage of the forraigner: For where but one selleth, the
  7657	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMerchandise is the dearer; and where but one buyeth the cheaper: Such
  7658	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCorporations therefore are no other then Monopolies; though they would
  7659	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe very profitable for a Common-wealth, if being bound up into one body
  7660	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin forraigne Markets they were at liberty at home, every man to buy, and
  7661	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsell at what price he could.
  7662	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7663	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe end then of these Bodies of Merchants, being not a Common benefit
  7664	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto the whole Body, (which have in this case no common stock, but what
  7665	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis deducted out of the particular adventures, for building, buying,
  7666	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tvictualling and manning of Ships,) but the particular gaine of
  7667	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevery adventurer, it is reason that every one be acquainted with the
  7668	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\temployment of his own; that is, that every one be of the Assembly, that
  7669	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshall have the power to order the same; and be acquainted with their
  7670	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\taccounts. And therefore the Representative of such a Body must be
  7671	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tan Assembly, where every member of the Body may be present at the
  7672	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsultations, if he will.
  7673	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7674	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIf a Body Politique of Merchants, contract a debt to a stranger by the
  7675	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tact of their Representative Assembly, every Member is lyable by himself
  7676	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor the whole. For a stranger can take no notice of their private Lawes,
  7677	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut considereth them as so many particular men, obliged every one to the
  7678	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhole payment, till payment made by one dischargeth all the rest: But if
  7679	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe debt be to one of the Company, the creditor is debter for the whole
  7680	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto himself, and cannot therefore demand his debt, but only from the
  7681	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommon stock, if there be any.
  7682	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7683	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIf the Common-wealth impose a Tax upon the Body, it is understood to be
  7684	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlayd upon every member proportionably to his particular adventure in the
  7685	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCompany. For there is in this case no other common stock, but what is
  7686	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmade of their particular adventures.
  7687	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7688	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIf a Mulct be layd upon the Body for some unlawfull act, they only are
  7689	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlyable by whose votes the act was decreed, or by whose assistance it was
  7690	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texecuted; for in none of the rest is there any other crime but being
  7691	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Body; which if a crime, (because the Body was ordeyned by the
  7692	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tauthority of the Common-wealth,) is not his.
  7693	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7694	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIf one of the Members be indebted to the Body, he may be sued by the
  7695	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBody; but his goods cannot be taken, nor his person imprisoned by the
  7696	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tauthority of the Body; but only by Authority of the Common-wealth:
  7697	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor if they can doe it by their own Authority, they can by their own
  7698	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAuthority give judgement that the debt is due, which is as much as to be
  7699	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJudge in their own Cause.

  7705	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7706	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThese Bodies made for the government of Men, or of Traffique, be either
  7707	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tperpetuall, or for a time prescribed by writing. But there be Bodies
  7708	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talso whose times are limited, and that only by the nature of their
  7709	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbusinesse. For example, if a Soveraign Monarch, or a Soveraign Assembly,
  7710	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshall think fit to give command to the towns, and other severall parts
  7711	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof their territory, to send to him their Deputies, to enforme him of the
  7712	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcondition, and necessities of the Subjects, or to advise with him for
  7713	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe making of good Lawes, or for any other cause, as with one Person
  7714	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trepresenting the whole Country, such Deputies, having a place and time
  7715	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof meeting assigned them, are there, and at that time, a Body Politique,
  7716	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trepresenting every Subject of that Dominion; but it is onely for such
  7717	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmatters as shall be propounded unto them by that Man, or Assembly, that
  7718	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby the Soveraign Authority sent for them; and when it shall be declared
  7719	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat nothing more shall be propounded, nor debated by them, the Body is
  7720	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdissolved. For if they were the absolute Representative of the people,
  7721	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthen were it the Soveraign Assembly; and so there would be two Soveraign
  7722	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAssemblies, or two Soveraigns, over the same people; which cannot
  7723	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsist with their Peace. And therefore where there is once a
  7724	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraignty, there can be no absolute Representation of the people, but
  7725	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby it. And for the limits of how farre such a Body shall represent the
  7726	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhole People, they are set forth in the Writing by which they were sent
  7727	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor. For the People cannot choose their Deputies to other intent, than
  7728	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis in the Writing directed to them from their Soveraign expressed.

  7736	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twithout Letters, or other written Authority, saving the Lawes common
  7737	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto all other Subjects. And because they be united in one Person
  7738	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRepresentative, they are held for Regular; such as are all Families, in
  7739	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich the Father, or Master ordereth the whole Family. For he obligeth
  7740	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this Children, and Servants, as farre as the Law permitteth, though not
  7741	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfurther, because none of them are bound to obedience in those actions,
  7742	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich the Law hath forbidden to be done. In all other actions, during
  7743	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe time they are under domestique government, they are subject to their
  7744	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFathers, and Masters, as to their immediate Soveraigns. For the Father,
  7745	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Master being before the Institution of Common-wealth, absolute

  7777	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunlawfull designe; and are for that cause Unlawfull, and go commonly by
  7778	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe name of factions, or Conspiracies. For a League being a connexion of
  7779	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen by Covenants, if there be no power given to any one Man or Assembly,
  7780	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(as in the condition of meer Nature) to compell them to performance,
  7781	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis so long onely valid, as there ariseth no just cause of distrust: and

  7783	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPower established, to keep them all in awe, are not onely lawfull, but
  7784	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talso profitable for the time they last. But Leagues of the Subjects of
  7785	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tone and the same Common-wealth, where every one may obtain his right
  7786	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby means of the Soveraign Power, are unnecessary to the maintaining of
  7787	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPeace and Justice, and (in case the designe of them be evill, or Unknown
  7788	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto the Common-wealth) unlawfull. For all uniting of strength by private
  7789	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen, is, if for evill intent, unjust; if for intent unknown, dangerous

  7815	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe government of his estate, and lawfull employment he has for them
  7816	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trequires, it is Faction, and unlawfull. For having the protection of the
  7817	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth, he needeth not the defence of private force. And whereas
  7818	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin Nations not throughly civilized, severall numerous Families have
  7819	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlived in continuall hostility, and invaded one another with private
  7820	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tforce; yet it is evident enough, that they have done unjustly; or else
  7821	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat they had no Common-wealth.

  7830	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Plebeians of old time in Rome, and of Aristocraticalls and
  7831	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDemocraticalls of old time in Greece, are unjust, as being contrary to
  7832	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe peace and safety of the people, and a taking of the Sword out of the
  7833	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thand of the Soveraign.
  7834	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7835	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConcourse of people, is an Irregular Systeme, the lawfulnesse, or
  7836	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunlawfulnesse, whereof dependeth on the occasion, and on the number of
  7837	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem that are assembled. If the occasion be lawfull, and manifest, the
  7838	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConcourse is lawfull; as the usuall meeting of men at Church, or at a
  7839	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpublique Shew, in usuall numbers: for if the numbers be extraordinarily
  7840	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgreat, the occasion is not evident; and consequently he that cannot
  7841	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trender a particular and good account of his being amongst them, is to
  7842	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe judged conscious of an unlawfull, and tumultuous designe. It may be
  7843	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlawfull for a thousand men, to joyn in a Petition to be delivered to a
  7844	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJudge, or Magistrate; yet if a thousand men come to present it, it is
  7845	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta tumultuous Assembly; because there needs but one or two for that
  7846	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpurpose. But in such cases as these, it is not a set number that makes
  7847	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Assembly Unlawfull, but such a number, as the present Officers are
  7848	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot able to suppresse, and bring to Justice.
  7849	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7850	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhen an unusuall number of men, assemble against a man whom they accuse;
  7851	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Assembly is an Unlawfull tumult; because they may deliver their
  7852	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\taccusation to the Magistrate by a few, or by one man. Such was the case
  7853	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof St. Paul at Ephesus; where Demetrius, and a great number of other
  7854	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen, brought two of Pauls companions before the Magistrate, saying with
  7855	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tone Voyce, "Great is Diana of the Ephesians;" which was their way of
  7856	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdemanding Justice against them for teaching the people such doctrine,
  7857	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas was against their Religion, and Trade. The occasion here, considering
  7858	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Lawes of that People, was just; yet was their Assembly Judged
  7859	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tUnlawfull, and the Magistrate reprehended them for it, in these
  7860	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twords,(Acts 19. 40) "If Demetrius and the other work-men can accuse any
  7861	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman, of any thing, there be Pleas, and Deputies, let them accuse one
  7862	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tanother. And if you have any other thing to demand, your case may
  7863	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe judged in an Assembly Lawfully called. For we are in danger to be
  7864	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\taccused for this dayes sedition, because, there is no cause by which any
  7865	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman can render any reason of this Concourse of People." Where he calleth
  7866	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tan Assembly, whereof men can give no just account, a Sedition, and such
  7867	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas they could not answer for. And this is all I shall say concerning
  7868	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSystemes, and Assemblyes of People, which may be compared (as I said,)
  7869	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto the Similar parts of mans Body; such as be Lawfull, to the Muscles;
  7870	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch as are Unlawfull, to Wens, Biles, and Apostemes, engendred by the

  7876	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7877	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7878	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn the last Chapter I have spoken of the Similar parts of a
  7879	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth; In this I shall speak of the parts Organicall, which are
  7880	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPublique Ministers.

  7886	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7887	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tA PUBLIQUE MINISTER, is he, that by the Soveraign, (whether a Monarch,
  7888	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor an Assembly,) is employed in any affaires, with Authority to
  7889	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trepresent in that employment, the Person of the Common-wealth. And
  7890	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhereas every man, or assembly that hath Soveraignty, representeth
  7891	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttwo Persons, or (as the more common phrase is) has two Capacities, one
  7892	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNaturall, and another Politique, (as a Monarch, hath the person not
  7893	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tonely of the Common-wealth, but also of a man; and a Soveraign Assembly
  7894	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thath the Person not onely of the Common-wealth, but also of the
  7895	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAssembly); they that be servants to them in their naturall Capacity,
  7896	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare not Publique Ministers; but those onely that serve them in the
  7897	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAdministration of the Publique businesse. And therefore neither Ushers,
  7898	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnor Sergeants, nor other Officers that waite on the Assembly, for
  7899	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tno other purpose, but for the commodity of the men assembled, in an
  7900	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAristocracy, or Democracy; nor Stewards, Chamberlains, Cofferers, or any
  7901	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother Officers of the houshold of a Monarch, are Publique Ministers in a

  7907	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMinisters For The Generall Administration
  7908	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7909	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf Publique Ministers, some have charge committed to them of a general
  7910	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAdministration, either of the whole Dominion, or of a part thereof.
  7911	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf the whole, as to a Protector, or Regent, may bee committed by
  7912	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Predecessor of an Infant King, during his minority, the whole
  7913	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAdministration of his Kingdome. In which case, every Subject is so far
  7914	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobliged to obedience, as the Ordinances he shall make, and the commands
  7915	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the shall give be in the Kings name, and not inconsistent with his
  7916	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraigne Power. Of a Part, or Province; as when either a Monarch, or
  7917	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Soveraign Assembly, shall give the generall charge thereof to a
  7918	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGovernour, Lieutenant, Praefect, or Vice-Roy: And in this case also,
  7919	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevery one of that Province, is obliged to all he shall doe in the name
  7920	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Soveraign, and that not incompatible with the Soveraigns Right.
  7921	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor such Protectors, Vice-Roys, and Governours, have no other right, but
  7922	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhat depends on the Soveraigns Will; and no Commission that can be given
  7923	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem, can be interpreted for a Declaration of the will to transferre the
  7924	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraignty, without expresse and perspicuous words to that purpose. And
  7925	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis kind of Publique Ministers resembleth the Nerves, and Tendons that
  7926	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmove the severall limbs of a body naturall.
  7927	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t

  7931	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor Speciall Administration, As For Oeconomy
  7932	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7933	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOthers have speciall Administration; that is to say, charges of some
  7934	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tspeciall businesse, either at home, or abroad: As at home, First, for
  7935	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Oeconomy of a Common-wealth, They that have Authority concerning the
  7936	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTreasure, as Tributes, Impositions, Rents, Fines, or whatsoever publique
  7937	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trevenue, to collect, receive, issue, or take the Accounts thereof,
  7938	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare Publique Ministers: Ministers, because they serve the Person
  7939	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRepresentative, and can doe nothing against his Command, nor without his
  7940	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAuthority: Publique, because they serve him in his Politicall Capacity.
  7941	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7942	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSecondly, they that have Authority concerning the Militia; to have the
  7943	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcustody of Armes, Forts, Ports; to Levy, Pay, or Conduct Souldiers; or
  7944	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto provide for any necessary thing for the use of war, either by Land or
  7945	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSea, are publique Ministers. But a Souldier without Command, though he
  7946	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfight for the Common-wealth, does not therefore represent the Person of
  7947	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit; because there is none to represent it to. For every one that hath
  7948	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommand, represents it to them only whom he commandeth.
  7949	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t

  7953	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor Instruction Of The People
  7954	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7955	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThey also that have authority to teach, or to enable others to teach
  7956	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe people their duty to the Soveraign Power, and instruct them in the
  7957	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tknowledge of what is just, and unjust, thereby to render them more apt
  7958	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto live in godlinesse, and in peace among themselves, and resist the
  7959	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpublique enemy, are Publique Ministers: Ministers, in that they doe it
  7960	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot by their own Authority, but by anothers; and Publique, because they
  7961	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdoe it (or should doe it) by no Authority, but that of the Soveraign.
  7962	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Monarch, or the Soveraign Assembly only hath immediate Authority
  7963	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom God, to teach and instruct the people; and no man but the
  7964	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign, receiveth his power Dei Gratia simply; that is to say, from
  7965	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe favour of none but God: All other, receive theirs from the favour
  7966	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand providence of God, and their Soveraigns; as in a Monarchy Dei Gratia
  7967	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t& Regis; or Dei Providentia & Voluntate Regis.

  7970	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7971	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7972	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor Judicature
  7973	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7974	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThey also to whom Jurisdiction is given, are Publique Ministers. For in
  7975	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir Seats of Justice they represent the person of the Soveraign; and
  7976	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir Sentence, is his Sentence; For (as hath been before declared) all
  7977	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJudicature is essentially annexed to the Soveraignty; and therefore all
  7978	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother Judges are but Ministers of him, or them that have the Soveraign
  7979	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPower. And as Controversies are of two sorts, namely of Fact, and of
  7980	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaw; so are judgements, some of Fact, some of Law: And consequently in
  7981	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe same controversie, there may be two Judges, one of Fact, another of
  7982	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaw.
  7983	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  7984	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd in both these controversies, there may arise a controversie between
  7985	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe party Judged, and the Judge; which because they be both Subjects to
  7986	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Soveraign, ought in Equity to be Judged by men agreed on by consent
  7987	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof both; for no man can be Judge in his own cause. But the Soveraign
  7988	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis already agreed on for Judge by them both, and is therefore either to
  7989	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\theare the Cause, and determine it himself, or appoint for Judge such as
  7990	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey shall both agree on. And this agreement is then understood to be
  7991	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmade between them divers wayes; as first, if the Defendant be allowed
  7992	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto except against such of his Judges, whose interest maketh him suspect
  7993	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem, (for as to the Complaynant he hath already chosen his own Judge,)
  7994	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose which he excepteth not against, are Judges he himself agrees on.
  7995	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSecondly, if he appeale to any other Judge, he can appeale no further;
  7996	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor his appeale is his choice. Thirdly, if he appeale to the Soveraign
  7997	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thimself, and he by himself, or by Delegates which the parties shall
  7998	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagree on, give Sentence; that Sentence is finall: for the Defendant is
  7999	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJudged by his own Judges, that is to say, by himself.
  8000	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8001	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThese properties of just and rationall Judicature considered, I cannot
  8002	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tforbeare to observe the excellent constitution of the Courts of Justice,
  8003	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\testablished both for Common, and also for Publique Pleas in England. By
  8004	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon Pleas, I meane those, where both the Complaynant and Defendant
  8005	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare Subjects: and by Publique, (which are also called Pleas of the
  8006	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCrown) those, where the Complaynant is the Soveraign. For whereas there
  8007	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere two orders of men, whereof one was Lords, the other Commons; The
  8008	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLords had this Priviledge, to have for Judges in all Capitall crimes,
  8009	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnone but Lords; and of them, as many as would be present; which being
  8010	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tever acknowledged as a Priviledge of favour, their Judges were none but
  8011	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch as they had themselves desired. And in all controversies, every
  8012	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSubject (as also in civill controversies the Lords) had for Judges, men
  8013	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Country where the matter in controversie lay; against which he
  8014	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmight make his exceptions, till at last Twelve men without exception
  8015	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeing agreed on, they were Judged by those twelve. So that having
  8016	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this own Judges, there could be nothing alledged by the party, why the
  8017	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsentence should not be finall, These publique persons, with Authority
  8018	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom the Soveraign Power, either to Instruct, or Judge the people,
  8019	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare such members of the Common-wealth, as may fitly be compared to the
  8020	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\torgans of Voice in a Body naturall.

  8025	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor Execution
  8026	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8027	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPublique Ministers are also all those, that have Authority from the
  8028	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign, to procure the Execution of Judgements given; to publish the
  8029	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraigns Commands; to suppresse Tumults; to apprehend, and imprison
  8030	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMalefactors; and other acts tending to the conservation of the
  8031	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPeace. For every act they doe by such Authority, is the act of the
  8032	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth; and their service, answerable to that of the Hands, in a
  8033	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBodie naturall.
  8034	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8035	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPublique Ministers abroad, are those that represent the Person of their
  8036	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\town Soveraign, to forraign States. Such are Ambassadors, Messengers,
  8037	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAgents, and Heralds, sent by publique Authoritie, and on publique
  8038	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBusinesse.
  8039	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8040	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut such as are sent by Authoritie only of some private partie of a
  8041	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttroubled State, though they be received, are neither Publique, nor
  8042	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPrivate Ministers of the Common-wealth; because none of their actions
  8043	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave the Common-wealth for Author. Likewise, an Ambassador sent from a
  8044	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPrince, to congratulate, condole, or to assist at a solemnity, though
  8045	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAuthority be Publique; yet because the businesse is Private, and
  8046	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbelonging to him in his naturall capacity; is a Private person. Also if
  8047	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta man be sent into another Country, secretly to explore their counsels,
  8048	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand strength; though both the Authority, and the Businesse be Publique;
  8049	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tyet because there is none to take notice of any Person in him, but
  8050	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this own; he is but a Private Minister; but yet a Minister of the
  8051	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth; and may be compared to an Eye in the Body naturall. And
  8052	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose that are appointed to receive the Petitions or other informations
  8053	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the People, and are as it were the publique Eare, are Publique
  8054	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMinisters, and represent their Soveraign in that office.

  8065	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Soveraign when it is required, or of offering it when it is not
  8066	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trequired, is a Publique Person. For the Advice is addressed to the
  8067	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign only, whose person cannot in his own presence, be represented
  8068	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto him, by another. But a Body of Counsellors, are never without some

  8088	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe NUTRITION of a Common-wealth consisteth, in the Plenty, and
  8089	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDistribution of Materials conducing to Life: In Concoction, or
  8090	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPreparation; and (when concocted) in the Conveyance of it, by convenient
  8091	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconduits, to the Publique use.
  8092	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8093	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAs for the Plenty of Matter, it is a thing limited by Nature, to those
  8094	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommodities, which from (the two breasts of our common Mother) Land,
  8095	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Sea, God usually either freely giveth, or for labour selleth to
  8096	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman-kind.
  8097	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8098	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor the Matter of this Nutriment, consisting in Animals, Vegetals, and
  8099	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMinerals, God hath freely layd them before us, in or neer to the face of
  8100	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Earth; so as there needeth no more but the labour, and industry
  8101	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof receiving them. Insomuch as Plenty dependeth (next to Gods favour)
  8102	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmeerly on the labour and industry of men.
  8103	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8104	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThis Matter, commonly called Commodities, is partly Native, and partly
  8105	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tForraign: Native, that which is to be had within the Territory of
  8106	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Common-wealth; Forraign, that which is imported from without. And
  8107	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbecause there is no Territory under the Dominion of one Common-wealth,
  8108	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(except it be of very vast extent,) that produceth all things needfull
  8109	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor the maintenance, and motion of the whole Body; and few that produce
  8110	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot something more than necessary; the superfluous commodities to be had
  8111	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twithin, become no more superfluous, but supply these wants at home, by
  8112	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\timportation of that which may be had abroad, either by Exchange, or
  8113	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby just Warre, or by Labour: for a mans Labour also, is a commodity
  8114	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texchangeable for benefit, as well as any other thing: And there have
  8115	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeen Common-wealths that having no more Territory, than hath served
  8116	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem for habitation, have neverthelesse, not onely maintained, but also
  8117	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tencreased their Power, partly by the labour of trading from one place to
  8118	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tanother, and partly by selling the Manifactures, whereof the Materials
  8119	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere brought in from other places.

  8122	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8123	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8124	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd The Right Of Distribution Of Them
  8125	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8126	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Distribution of the Materials of this Nourishment, is the
  8127	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconstitution of Mine, and Thine, and His, that is to say, in one word
  8128	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPropriety; and belongeth in all kinds of Common-wealth to the Soveraign
  8129	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPower. For where there is no Common-wealth, there is, (as hath been
  8130	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talready shewn) a perpetuall warre of every man against his neighbour;
  8131	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd therefore every thing is his that getteth it, and keepeth it by
  8132	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tforce; which is neither Propriety nor Community; but Uncertainty. Which
  8133	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis so evident, that even Cicero, (a passionate defender of Liberty,) in
  8134	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta publique pleading, attributeth all Propriety to the Law Civil, "Let
  8135	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Civill Law," saith he, "be once abandoned, or but negligently
  8136	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tguarded, (not to say oppressed,) and there is nothing, that any man can
  8137	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe sure to receive from his Ancestor, or leave to his Children." And
  8138	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagain; "Take away the Civill Law, and no man knows what is his own, and
  8139	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhat another mans." Seeing therefore the Introduction of Propriety is
  8140	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tan effect of Common-wealth; which can do nothing but by the Person that
  8141	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRepresents it, it is the act onely of the Soveraign; and consisteth in
  8142	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Lawes, which none can make that have not the Soveraign Power. And
  8143	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis they well knew of old, who called that Nomos, (that is to say,
  8144	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDistribution,) which we call Law; and defined Justice, by distributing
  8145	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto every man his own.

  8151	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8152	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFrom The Arbitrary Distribution Of The Soveraign
  8153	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8154	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn this Distribution, the First Law, is for Division of the Land it
  8155	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tselfe: wherein the Soveraign assigneth to every man a portion, according
  8156	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas he, and not according as any Subject, or any number of them, shall
  8157	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tjudge agreeable to Equity, and the Common Good. The Children of Israel,
  8158	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere a Common-wealth in the Wildernesse; but wanted the commodities
  8159	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Earth, till they were masters of the Land of Promise; which
  8160	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tafterward was divided amongst them, not by their own discretion, but
  8161	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby the discretion of Eleazar the Priest, and Joshua their Generall: who
  8162	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhen there were twelve Tribes, making them thirteen by subdivision of
  8163	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Tribe of Joseph; made neverthelesse but twelve portions of the Land;
  8164	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand ordained for the Tribe of Levi no land; but assigned them the Tenth
  8165	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpart of the whole fruits; which division was therefore Arbitrary. And
  8166	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthough a People comming into possession of a land by warre, do not
  8167	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talwaies exterminate the antient Inhabitants, (as did the Jewes,) but
  8168	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tleave to many, or most, or all of them their Estates; yet it is manifest
  8169	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey hold them afterwards, as of the Victors distribution; as the people
  8170	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof England held all theirs of William the Conquerour.

  8174	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8175	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPropriety Of A Subject Excludes Not The Dominion Of The Soveraign,
  8176	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8177	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut Onely Of Another Subject
  8178	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8179	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFrom whence we may collect, that the Propriety which a subject hath in
  8180	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this lands, consisteth in a right to exclude all other subjects from the
  8181	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tuse of them; and not to exclude their Soveraign, be it an Assembly, or
  8182	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Monarch. For seeing the Soveraign, that is to say, the Common-wealth
  8183	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(whose Person he representeth,) is understood to do nothing but in order
  8184	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto the common Peace and Security, this Distribution of lands, is to be
  8185	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunderstood as done in order to the same: And consequently, whatsoever
  8186	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDistribution he shall make in prejudice thereof, is contrary to the
  8187	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twill of every subject, that committed his Peace, and safety to his
  8188	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdiscretion, and conscience; and therefore by the will of every one of
  8189	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem, is to be reputed voyd. It is true, that a Soveraign Monarch, or
  8190	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe greater part of a Soveraign Assembly, may ordain the doing of many
  8191	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthings in pursuit of their Passions, contrary to their own consciences,
  8192	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich is a breach of trust, and of the Law of Nature; but this is not
  8193	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tenough to authorise any subject, either to make warre upon, or so much
  8194	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas to accuse of Injustice, or any way to speak evill of their Soveraign;
  8195	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbecause they have authorised all his actions, and in bestowing the
  8196	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign Power, made them their own. But in what cases the Commands
  8197	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Soveraigns are contrary to Equity, and the Law of Nature, is to be
  8198	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsidered hereafter in another place.

  8205	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn the Distribution of land, the Common-wealth it selfe, may be
  8206	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconceived to have a portion, and possesse, and improve the same by
  8207	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir Representative; and that such portion may be made sufficient, to
  8208	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsusteine the whole expence to the common Peace, and defence necessarily
  8209	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trequired: Which were very true, if there could be any Representative
  8210	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconceived free from humane passions, and infirmities. But the nature
  8211	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof men being as it is, the setting forth of Publique Land, or of any
  8212	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcertaine Revenue for the Common-wealth, is in vaine; and tendeth to the
  8213	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdissolution of Government, and to the condition of meere Nature, and
  8214	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWar, assoon as ever the Soveraign Power falleth into the hands of a
  8215	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMonarch, or of an Assembly, that are either too negligent of mony, or
  8216	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttoo hazardous in engaging the publique stock, into a long, or costly
  8217	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twar. Common-wealths can endure no Diet: For seeing their expence is
  8218	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot limited by their own appetite, but by externall Accidents, and the
  8219	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tappetites of their neighbours, the Publique Riches cannot be limited by
  8220	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother limits, than those which the emergent occasions shall require. And
  8221	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhereas in England, there were by the Conquerour, divers Lands
  8222	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treserved to his own use, (besides Forrests, and Chases, either for his
  8223	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trecreation, or for preservation of Woods,) and divers services reserved
  8224	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ton the Land he gave his Subjects; yet it seems they were not reserved
  8225	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor his Maintenance in his Publique, but in his Naturall capacity: For
  8226	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the, and his Successors did for all that, lay Arbitrary Taxes on all
  8227	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSubjects land, when they judged it necessary. Or if those publique
  8228	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLands, and Services, were ordained as a sufficient maintenance of the
  8229	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth, it was contrary to the scope of the Institution; being
  8230	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(as it appeared by those ensuing Taxes) insufficient, and (as it
  8231	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tappeares by the late Revenue of the Crown) Subject to Alienation,
  8232	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Diminution. It is therefore in vaine, to assign a portion to the
  8233	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth; which may sell, or give it away; and does sell, and give
  8234	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit away when tis done by their Representative.

  8244	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand for what commodities, the Subject shall traffique abroad, belongeth
  8245	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto the Soveraign. For if it did belong to private persons to use their
  8246	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\town discretion therein, some of them would bee drawn for gaine, both
  8247	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto furnish the enemy with means to hurt the Common-wealth, and hurt it
  8248	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthemselves, by importing such things, as pleasing mens appetites, be
  8249	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tneverthelesse noxious, or at least unprofitable to them. And therefore
  8250	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit belongeth to the Common-wealth, (that is, to the Soveraign only,)
  8251	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto approve, or disapprove both of the places, and matter of forraign

  8258	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8259	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFurther, seeing it is not enough to the Sustentation of a Common-wealth,
  8260	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat every man have a propriety in a portion of Land, or in some few
  8261	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommodities, or a naturall property in some usefull art, and there is no
  8262	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tart in the world, but is necessary either for the being, or well being
  8263	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talmost of every particular man; it is necessary, that men distribute
  8264	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat which they can spare, and transferre their propriety therein,
  8265	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmutually one to another, by exchange, and mutuall contract. And
  8266	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore it belongeth to the Common-wealth, (that is to say, to the
  8267	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign,) to appoint in what manner, all kinds of contract between
  8268	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSubjects, (as buying, selling, exchanging, borrowing, lending, letting,
  8269	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand taking to hire,) are to bee made; and by what words, and signes they
  8270	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshall be understood for valid. And for the Matter, and Distribution of
  8271	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Nourishment, to the severall Members of the Common-wealth, thus much

  8278	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8279	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBy Concoction, I understand the reducing of all commodities, which are
  8280	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot presently consumed, but reserved for Nourishment in time to come, to
  8281	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsome thing of equal value, and withall so portably, as not to hinder
  8282	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe motion of men from place to place; to the end a man may have in
  8283	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhat place soever, such Nourishment as the place affordeth. And this is
  8284	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnothing else but Gold, and Silver, and Mony. For Gold and Silver, being
  8285	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(as it happens) almost in all Countries of the world highly valued, is a
  8286	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommodious measure for the value of all things else between Nations; and
  8287	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMony (of what matter soever coyned by the Soveraign of a Common-wealth,)
  8288	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis a sufficient measure of the value of all things else, between the
  8289	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSubjects of that Common-wealth. By the means of which measures, all
  8290	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommodities, Moveable, and Immoveable, are made to accompany a man, to
  8291	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall places of his resort, within and without the place of his
  8292	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tordinary residence; and the same passeth from Man to Man, within the
  8293	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth; and goes round about, Nourishing (as it passeth)
  8294	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevery part thereof; In so much as this Concoction, is as it were the
  8295	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSanguification of the Common-wealth: For naturall Bloud is in like
  8296	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmanner made of the fruits of the Earth; and circulating, nourisheth by
  8297	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe way, every Member of the Body of Man.
  8298	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8299	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd because Silver and Gold, have their value from the matter it self;
  8300	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey have first this priviledge, that the value of them cannot be
  8301	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\taltered by the power of one, nor of a few Common-wealths; as being a
  8302	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommon measure of the commodities of all places. But base Mony, may
  8303	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teasily be enhanced, or abased. Secondly, they have the priviledge to
  8304	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmake Common-wealths, move, and stretch out their armes, when need is,
  8305	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinto forraign Countries; and supply, not only private Subjects that
  8306	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttravell, but also whole Armies with provision. But that Coyne, which is
  8307	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot considerable for the Matter, but for the Stamp of the place, being
  8308	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunable to endure change of ayr, hath its effect at home only; where
  8309	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talso it is subject to the change of Laws, and thereby to have the value
  8310	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdiminished, to the prejudice many times of those that have it.

  8317	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Conduits, and Wayes by which it is conveyed to the Publique use, are

  8332	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8333	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Procreation, or Children of a Common-wealth, are those we call
  8334	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPlantations, or Colonies; which are numbers of men sent out from the
  8335	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth, under a Conductor, or Governour, to inhabit a Forraign
  8336	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCountry, either formerly voyd of Inhabitants, or made voyd then, by
  8337	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twarre. And when a Colony is setled, they are either a Common-wealth of
  8338	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthemselves, discharged of their subjection to their Soveraign that sent
  8339	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem, (as hath been done by many Common-wealths of antient time,) in
  8340	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich case the Common-wealth from which they went was called their
  8341	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMetropolis, or Mother, and requires no more of them, then Fathers
  8342	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trequire of the Children, whom they emancipate, and make free from their
  8343	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdomestique government, which is Honour, and Friendship; or else they
  8344	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tremain united to their Metropolis, as were the Colonies of the people of
  8345	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRome; and then they are no Common-wealths themselves, but Provinces, and
  8346	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tparts of the Common-wealth that sent them. So that the Right of Colonies
  8347	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(saving Honour, and League with their Metropolis,) dependeth wholly on
  8348	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir Licence, or Letters, by which their Soveraign authorised them to
  8349	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPlant.

  8355	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8356	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8357	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8358	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCounsell What
  8359	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8360	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHow fallacious it is to judge of the nature of things, by the ordinary
  8361	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand inconstant use of words, appeareth in nothing more, than in the
  8362	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconfusion of Counsels, and Commands, arising from the Imperative manner
  8363	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof speaking in them both, and in may other occasions besides. For the
  8364	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twords "Doe this," are the words not onely of him that Commandeth; but
  8365	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talso of him that giveth Counsell; and of him that Exhorteth; and yet
  8366	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere are but few, that see not, that these are very different things;
  8367	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor that cannot distinguish between them, when they perceive who it
  8368	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis that speaketh, and to whom the Speech is directed, and upon what
  8369	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\toccasion. But finding those phrases in mens writings, and being not
  8370	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\table, or not willing to enter into a consideration of the circumstances,
  8371	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey mistake sometimes the Precepts of Counsellours, for the Precepts
  8372	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof them that command; and sometimes the contrary; according as it best
  8373	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagreeth with the conclusions they would inferre, or the actions
  8374	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey approve. To avoyd which mistakes, and render to those termes
  8375	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Commanding, Counselling, and Exhorting, their proper and distinct
  8376	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsignifications, I define them thus.
  8377	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8378	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8379	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8380	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8381	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDifferences Between Command And Counsell
  8382	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8383	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCOMMAND is, where a man saith, "Doe this," or "Doe this not," without
  8384	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texpecting other reason than the Will of him that sayes it. From this it
  8385	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfolloweth manifestly, that he that Commandeth, pretendeth thereby his
  8386	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\town Benefit: For the reason of his Command is his own Will onely, and
  8387	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe proper object of every mans Will, is some Good to himselfe.
  8388	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8389	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCOUNSELL, is where a man saith, "Doe" or "Doe not this," and deduceth
  8390	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this own reasons from the benefit that arriveth by it to him to whom he
  8391	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsaith it. And from this it is evident, that he that giveth Counsell,
  8392	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpretendeth onely (whatsoever he intendeth) the good of him, to whom he
  8393	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgiveth it.
  8394	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8395	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTherefore between Counsell and Command, one great difference is, that
  8396	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommand is directed to a mans own benefit; and Counsell to the benefit
  8397	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof another man. And from this ariseth another difference, that a man
  8398	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmay be obliged to do what he is Commanded; as when he hath covenanted
  8399	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto obey: But he cannot be obliged to do as he is Counselled, because the
  8400	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thurt of not following it, is his own; or if he should covenant to follow
  8401	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit, then is the Counsell turned into the nature of a Command. A third
  8402	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdifference between them is, that no man can pretend a right to be of
  8403	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tanother mans Counsell; because he is not to pretend benefit by it to
  8404	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thimselfe; but to demand right to Counsell another, argues a will to know
  8405	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this designes, or to gain some other Good to himselfe; which (as I said
  8406	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbefore) is of every mans will the proper object.
  8407	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8408	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThis also is incident to the nature of Counsell; that whatsoever it be,
  8409	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the that asketh it, cannot in equity accuse, or punish it: For to ask
  8410	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCounsell of another, is to permit him to give such Counsell as he shall
  8411	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthink best; And consequently, he that giveth counsell to his Soveraign,
  8412	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(whether a Monarch, or an Assembly) when he asketh it, cannot in equity
  8413	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe punished for it, whether the same be conformable to the opinion of
  8414	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe most, or not, so it be to the Proposition in debate. For if the
  8415	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsense of the Assembly can be taken notice of, before the Debate be
  8416	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tended, they should neither ask, nor take any further Counsell; For the
  8417	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSense of the Assembly, is the Resolution of the Debate, and End of all
  8418	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDeliberation. And generally he that demandeth Counsell, is Author of it;
  8419	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand therefore cannot punish it; and what the Soveraign cannot, no man
  8420	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\telse can. But if one Subject giveth Counsell to another, to do any
  8421	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthing contrary to the Lawes, whether that Counsell proceed from
  8422	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevill intention, or from ignorance onely, it is punishable by the
  8423	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth; because ignorance of the Law, is no good excuse, where
  8424	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevery man is bound to take notice of the Lawes to which he is subject.
  8425	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8426	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8427	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8428	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8429	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tExhortation And Dehortation What
  8430	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8431	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEXHORTATION, and DEHORTATION, is Counsell, accompanied with signes in
  8432	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim that giveth it, of vehement desire to have it followed; or to say it
  8433	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmore briefly, Counsell Vehemently Pressed. For he that Exhorteth, doth
  8434	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot deduce the consequences of what he adviseth to be done, and tye
  8435	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thimselfe therein to the rigour of true reasoning; but encourages him he
  8436	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCounselleth, to Action: As he that Dehorteth, deterreth him from it. And
  8437	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore they have in their speeches, a regard to the common Passions,
  8438	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand opinions of men, in deducing their reasons; and make use of
  8439	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSimilitudes, Metaphors, Examples, and other tooles of Oratory, to
  8440	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tperswade their Hearers of the Utility, Honour, or Justice of following
  8441	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir advise.
  8442	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8443	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFrom whence may be inferred, First, that Exhortation and Dehortation,
  8444	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis directed to the Good of him that giveth the Counsell, not of him that
  8445	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tasketh it, which is contrary to the duty of a Counsellour; who (by the
  8446	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdefinition of Counsell) ought to regard, not his own benefits, but his
  8447	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhom he adviseth. And that he directeth his Counsell to his own
  8448	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbenefit, is manifest enough, by the long and vehement urging, or by
  8449	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe artificial giving thereof; which being not required of him, and
  8450	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsequently proceeding from his own occasions, is directed principally
  8451	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto his own benefit, and but accidentarily to the good of him that is
  8452	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCounselled, or not at all.
  8453	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8454	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSecondly, that the use of Exhortation and Dehortation lyeth onely, where
  8455	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta man is to speak to a Multitude; because when the Speech is addressed
  8456	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto one, he may interrupt him, and examine his reasons more rigorously,
  8457	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthan can be done in a Multitude; which are too many to enter into
  8458	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDispute, and Dialogue with him that speaketh indifferently to them
  8459	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall at once. Thirdly, that they that Exhort and Dehort, where they are
  8460	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trequired to give Counsell, are corrupt Counsellours, and as it were
  8461	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbribed by their own interest. For though the Counsell they give be never
  8462	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tso good; yet he that gives it, is no more a good Counsellour, than he
  8463	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat giveth a Just Sentence for a reward, is a just Judge. But where a
  8464	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman may lawfully Command, as a Father in his Family, or a Leader in an
  8465	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tArmy, his Exhortations and Dehortations, are not onely lawfull, but
  8466	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talso necessary, and laudable: But then they are no more Counsells, but
  8467	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommands; which when they are for Execution of soure labour; sometimes
  8468	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnecessity, and alwayes humanity requireth to be sweetned in the
  8469	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdelivery, by encouragement, and in the tune and phrase of Counsell,
  8470	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trather then in harsher language of Command.
  8471	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8472	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tExamples of the difference between Command and Counsell, we may take
  8473	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom the formes of Speech that expresse them in Holy Scripture. "Have no
  8474	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother Gods but me; Make to thy selfe no graven Image; Take not Gods name
  8475	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin vain; Sanctifie the Sabbath; Honour thy Parents; Kill not; Steale
  8476	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot," &c. are Commands; because the reason for which we are to obey
  8477	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem, is drawn from the will of God our King, whom we are obliged to
  8478	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobey. But these words, "Sell all thou hast; give it to the poore; and
  8479	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfollow me," are Counsell; because the reason for which we are to do
  8480	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tso, is drawn from our own benefit; which is this, that we shall have
  8481	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"Treasure in Heaven." These words, "Go into the village over against
  8482	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tyou, and you shall find an Asse tyed, and her Colt; loose her, and bring
  8483	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ther to me," are a Command: for the reason of their fact is drawn from
  8484	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe will of their Master: but these words, "Repent, and be Baptized in
  8485	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Name of Jesus," are Counsell; because the reason why we should so
  8486	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdo, tendeth not to any benefit of God Almighty, who shall still be King
  8487	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin what manner soever we rebell; but of our selves, who have no other
  8488	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmeans of avoyding the punishment hanging over us for our sins.
  8489	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8490	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8491	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8492	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8493	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDifferences Of Fit And Unfit Counsellours
  8494	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8495	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAs the difference of Counsell from Command, hath been now deduced from
  8496	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe nature of Counsell, consisting in a deducing of the benefit, or
  8497	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thurt that may arise to him that is to be Counselled, by the necessary
  8498	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor probable consequences of the action he propoundeth; so may also the
  8499	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdifferences between apt, and inept counsellours be derived from the
  8500	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsame. For Experience, being but Memory of the consequences of like
  8501	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tactions formerly observed, and Counsell but the Speech whereby that
  8502	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texperience is made known to another; the Vertues, and Defects of
  8503	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCounsell, are the same with the Vertues, and Defects Intellectuall:
  8504	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd to the Person of a Common-wealth, his Counsellours serve him in the
  8505	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tplace of Memory, and Mentall Discourse. But with this resemblance of the
  8506	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth, to a naturall man, there is one dissimilitude joyned,
  8507	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof great importance; which is, that a naturall man receiveth his
  8508	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texperience, from the naturall objects of sense, which work upon him
  8509	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twithout passion, or interest of their own; whereas they that give
  8510	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCounsell to the Representative person of a Common-wealth, may have,
  8511	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand have often their particular ends, and passions, that render their
  8512	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCounsells alwayes suspected, and many times unfaithfull. And therefore
  8513	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twe may set down for the first condition of a good Counsellour, That His
  8514	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEnds, And Interest, Be Not Inconsistent With The Ends And Interest Of
  8515	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHim He Counselleth.
  8516	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8517	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSecondly, Because the office of a Counsellour, when an action comes
  8518	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinto deliberation, is to make manifest the consequences of it, in such
  8519	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmanner, as he that is Counselled may be truly and evidently informed; he
  8520	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tought to propound his advise, in such forme of speech, as may make
  8521	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe truth most evidently appear; that is to say, with as firme
  8522	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tratiocination, as significant and proper language, and as briefly, as
  8523	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe evidence will permit. And therefore Rash, And Unevident Inferences;
  8524	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(such as are fetched onely from Examples, or authority of Books, and are
  8525	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot arguments of what is good, or evill, but witnesses of fact, or
  8526	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof opinion,) Obscure, Confused, And Ambiguous Expressions, Also All
  8527	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMetaphoricall Speeches, Tending To The Stirring Up Of Passion, (because
  8528	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch reasoning, and such expressions, are usefull onely to deceive, or
  8529	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto lead him we Counsell towards other ends than his own) Are Repugnant
  8530	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo The Office Of A Counsellour.
  8531	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8532	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThirdly, Because the Ability of Counselling proceedeth from Experience,
  8533	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand long study; and no man is presumed to have experience in all those
  8534	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthings that to the Administration of a great Common-wealth are necessary
  8535	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto be known, No Man Is Presumed To Be A Good Counsellour, But In Such
  8536	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBusinesse, As He Hath Not Onely Been Much Versed In, But Hath Also
  8537	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMuch Meditated On, And Considered. For seeing the businesse of a
  8538	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth is this, to preserve the people at home, and defend them
  8539	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagainst forraign Invasion, we shall find, it requires great knowledge
  8540	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the disposition of Man-kind, of the Rights of Government, and of the
  8541	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnature of Equity, Law, Justice, and Honour, not to be attained without
  8542	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tstudy; And of the Strength, Commodities, Places, both of their own
  8543	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCountry, and their Neighbours; as also of the inclinations, and designes
  8544	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof all Nations that may any way annoy them. And this is not attained to,
  8545	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twithout much experience. Of which things, not onely the whole summe, but
  8546	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevery one of the particulars requires the age, and observation of a man
  8547	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin years, and of more than ordinary study. The wit required for Counsel,
  8548	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas I have said before is Judgement. And the differences of men in that
  8549	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpoint come from different education, of some to one kind of study, or
  8550	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbusinesse, and of others to another. When for the doing of any thing,
  8551	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere be Infallible rules, (as in Engines, and Edifices, the rules of
  8552	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGeometry,) all the experience of the world cannot equall his Counsell,
  8553	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat has learnt, or found out the Rule. And when there is no such Rule,
  8554	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the that hath most experience in that particular kind of businesse, has
  8555	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherein the best Judgement, and is the best Counsellour.
  8556	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8557	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFourthly, to be able to give Counsell to a Common-wealth, in a businesse
  8558	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat hath reference to another Common-wealth, It Is Necessary To Be
  8559	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAcquainted With The Intelligences, And Letters That Come From Thence,
  8560	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd With All The Records Of Treaties, And Other Transactions Of State
  8561	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBetween Them; which none can doe, but such as the Representative
  8562	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshall think fit. By which we may see, that they who are not called to
  8563	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCounsell, can have no good Counsell in such cases to obtrude.
  8564	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8565	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFifthly, Supposing the number of Counsellors equall, a man is better
  8566	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCounselled by hearing them apart, then in an Assembly; and that for many
  8567	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcauses. First, in hearing them apart, you have the advice of every man;
  8568	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut in an Assembly may of them deliver their advise with I, or No, or
  8569	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith their hands, or feet, not moved by their own sense, but by the
  8570	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teloquence of another, or for feare of displeasing some that have spoken,
  8571	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor the whole Assembly, by contradiction; or for feare of appearing
  8572	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tduller in apprehension, than those that have applauded the contrary
  8573	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\topinion. Secondly, in an Assembly of many, there cannot choose but be
  8574	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsome whose interests are contrary to that of the Publique; and these
  8575	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir Interests make passionate, and Passion eloquent, and Eloquence
  8576	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdrawes others into the same advice. For the Passions of men, which
  8577	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tasunder are moderate, as the heat of one brand; in Assembly are like
  8578	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmany brands, that enflame one another, (especially when they blow one
  8579	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tanother with Orations) to the setting of the Common-wealth on fire,
  8580	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunder pretence of Counselling it. Thirdly, in hearing every man apart,
  8581	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tone may examine (when there is need) the truth, or probability of
  8582	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this reasons, and of the grounds of the advise he gives, by frequent
  8583	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinterruptions, and objections; which cannot be done in an Assembly,
  8584	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhere (in every difficult question) a man is rather astonied, and dazled
  8585	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith the variety of discourse upon it, than informed of the course he
  8586	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tought to take. Besides, there cannot be an Assembly of many, called
  8587	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttogether for advice, wherein there be not some, that have the ambition
  8588	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto be thought eloquent, and also learned in the Politiques; and give not
  8589	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir advice with care of the businesse propounded, but of the applause
  8590	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof their motly orations, made of the divers colored threds, or shreds of
  8591	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAuthors; which is an Impertinence at least, that takes away the time
  8592	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof serious Consultation, and in the secret way of Counselling apart, is
  8593	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teasily avoided. Fourthly, in Deliberations that ought to be kept secret,
  8594	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(whereof there be many occasions in Publique Businesse,) the Counsells
  8595	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof many, and especially in Assemblies, are dangerous; And therefore
  8596	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgreat Assemblies are necessitated to commit such affaires to lesser
  8597	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnumbers, and of such persons as are most versed, and in whose fidelity
  8598	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey have most confidence.
  8599	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8600	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo conclude, who is there that so far approves the taking of Counsell
  8601	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom a great Assembly of Counsellours, that wisheth for, or would accept
  8602	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof their pains, when there is a question of marrying his Children,
  8603	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdisposing of his Lands, governing his Household, or managing his
  8604	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprivate Estate, especially if there be amongst them such as wish not
  8605	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this prosperity? A man that doth his businesse by the help of many and
  8606	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprudent Counsellours, with every one consulting apart in his proper
  8607	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\telement, does it best, as he that useth able Seconds at Tennis play,
  8608	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tplaced in their proper stations. He does next best, that useth his own
  8609	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJudgement only; as he that has no Second at all. But he that is carried
  8610	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tup and down to his businesse in a framed Counsell, which cannot move
  8611	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut by the plurality of consenting opinions, the execution whereof is
  8612	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommonly (out of envy, or interest) retarded by the part dissenting,
  8613	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdoes it worst of all, and like one that is carried to the ball, though
  8614	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby good Players, yet in a Wheele-barrough, or other frame, heavy of it
  8615	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tself, and retarded also by the inconcurrent judgements, and endeavours
  8616	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof them that drive it; and so much the more, as they be more that set
  8617	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir hands to it; and most of all, when there is one, or more amongst
  8618	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem, that desire to have him lose. And though it be true, that many eys
  8619	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsee more then one; yet it is not to be understood of many Counsellours;
  8620	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut then only, when the finall Resolution is in one man. Otherwise,
  8621	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbecause many eyes see the same thing in divers lines, and are apt to
  8622	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlook asquint towards their private benefit; they that desire not to
  8623	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmisse their marke, though they look about with two eyes, yet they never
  8624	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tayme but with one; And therefore no great Popular Common-wealth was
  8625	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tever kept up; but either by a forraign Enemy that united them; or by
  8626	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe reputation of some one eminent Man amongst them; or by the secret
  8627	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCounsell of a few; or by the mutuall feare of equall factions; and
  8628	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot by the open Consultations of the Assembly. And as for very little
  8629	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealths, be they Popular, or Monarchicall, there is no humane
  8630	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twisdome can uphold them, longer then the Jealousy lasteth of their
  8631	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpotent Neighbours.

  8635	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCHAPTER XXVI. OF CIVILL LAWES
  8636	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8637	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8638	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8639	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8640	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCivill Law what
  8641	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8642	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBy CIVILL LAWES, I understand the Lawes, that men are therefore bound to
  8643	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobserve, because they are Members, not of this, or that Common-wealth
  8644	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin particular, but of a Common-wealth. For the knowledge of particular
  8645	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLawes belongeth to them, that professe the study of the Lawes of their
  8646	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tseverall Countries; but the knowledge of Civill Law in generall, to any
  8647	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman. The antient Law of Rome was called their Civil Law, from the word
  8648	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCivitas, which signifies a Common-wealth; And those Countries, which
  8649	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thaving been under the Roman Empire, and governed by that Law, retaine
  8650	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tstill such part thereof as they think fit, call that part the Civill
  8651	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaw, to distinguish it from the rest of their own Civill Lawes. But that
  8652	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis not it I intend to speak of here; my designe being not to shew what
  8653	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis Law here, and there; but what is Law; as Plato, Aristotle, Cicero,
  8654	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand divers others have done, without taking upon them the profession of
  8655	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe study of the Law.
  8656	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8657	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd first it manifest, that Law in generall, is not Counsell, but
  8658	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommand; nor a Command of any man to any man; but only of him, whose
  8659	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommand is addressed to one formerly obliged to obey him. And as for
  8660	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCivill Law, it addeth only the name of the person Commanding, which is
  8661	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPersona Civitatis, the Person of the Common-wealth.
  8662	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8663	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhich considered, I define Civill Law in this Manner. "CIVILL LAW, Is to
  8664	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevery Subject, those Rules, which the Common-wealth hath Commanded him,
  8665	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby Word, Writing, or other sufficient Sign of the Will, to make use
  8666	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof, for the Distinction of Right, and Wrong; that is to say, of what is
  8667	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontrary, and what is not contrary to the Rule."
  8668	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8669	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn which definition, there is nothing that is not at first sight
  8670	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevident. For every man seeth, that some Lawes are addressed to all the
  8671	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSubjects in generall; some to particular Provinces; some to particular
  8672	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tVocations; and some to particular Men; and are therefore Lawes, to every
  8673	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof those to whom the Command is directed; and to none else. As also,
  8674	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat Lawes are the Rules of Just, and Unjust; nothing being reputed
  8675	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tUnjust, that is not contrary to some Law. Likewise, that none can
  8676	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmake Lawes but the Common-wealth; because our Subjection is to the
  8677	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth only: and that Commands, are to be signified by sufficient
  8678	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSigns; because a man knows not otherwise how to obey them. And
  8679	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore, whatsoever can from this definition by necessary consequence
  8680	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe deduced, ought to be acknowledged for truth. Now I deduce from it
  8681	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis that followeth.
  8682	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8683	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8684	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8685	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8686	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Soveraign Is Legislator
  8687	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8688	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t1. The Legislator in all Common-wealths, is only the Soveraign, be he
  8689	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tone Man, as in a Monarchy, or one Assembly of men, as in a Democracy,
  8690	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor Aristocracy. For the Legislator, is he that maketh the Law. And the
  8691	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth only, praescribes, and commandeth the observation of those
  8692	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trules, which we call Law: Therefore the Common-wealth is the Legislator.
  8693	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut the Common-wealth is no Person, nor has capacity to doe any thing,
  8694	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut by the Representative, (that is, the Soveraign;) and therefore the
  8695	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign is the sole Legislator. For the same reason, none can abrogate
  8696	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Law made, but the Soveraign; because a Law is not abrogated, but by
  8697	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tanother Law, that forbiddeth it to be put in execution.
  8698	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8699	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8700	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8701	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8702	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd Not Subject To Civill Law
  8703	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8704	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t2. The Soveraign of a Common-wealth, be it an Assembly, or one Man, is
  8705	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot subject to the Civill Lawes. For having power to make, and repeale
  8706	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLawes, he may when he pleaseth, free himselfe from that subjection,
  8707	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby repealing those Lawes that trouble him, and making of new; and
  8708	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsequently he was free before. For he is free, that can be free when
  8709	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the will: Nor is it possible for any person to be bound to himselfe;
  8710	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbecause he that can bind, can release; and therefore he that is bound to
  8711	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thimselfe onely, is not bound.
  8712	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8713	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8714	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8715	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8716	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tUse, A Law Not By Vertue Of Time, But Of The Soveraigns Consent
  8717	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8718	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t3. When long Use obtaineth the authority of a Law, it is not the
  8719	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLength of Time that maketh the Authority, but the Will of the Soveraign
  8720	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsignified by his silence, (for Silence is sometimes an argument of
  8721	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConsent;) and it is no longer Law, then the Soveraign shall be silent
  8722	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherein. And therefore if the Soveraign shall have a question of Right
  8723	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgrounded, not upon his present Will, but upon the Lawes formerly
  8724	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmade; the Length of Time shal bring no prejudice to his Right; but the
  8725	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tquestion shal be judged by Equity. For many unjust Actions, and unjust
  8726	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSentences, go uncontrolled a longer time, than any man can remember.
  8727	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd our Lawyers account no Customes Law, but such as are reasonable, and
  8728	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat evill Customes are to be abolished; But the Judgement of what is
  8729	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treasonable, and of what is to be abolished, belongeth to him that maketh
  8730	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Law, which is the Soveraign Assembly, or Monarch.
  8731	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8732	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8733	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8734	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8735	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Law Of Nature, And The Civill Law Contain Each Other
  8736	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8737	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t4. The Law of Nature, and the Civill Law, contain each other, and are
  8738	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof equall extent. For the Lawes of Nature, which consist in Equity,
  8739	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJustice, Gratitude, and other morall Vertues on these depending, in the
  8740	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcondition of meer Nature (as I have said before in the end of the 15th
  8741	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChapter,) are not properly Lawes, but qualities that dispose men to
  8742	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpeace, and to obedience. When a Common-wealth is once settled, then are
  8743	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey actually Lawes, and not before; as being then the commands of the
  8744	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth; and therefore also Civill Lawes: for it is the Soveraign
  8745	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPower that obliges men to obey them. For in the differences of private
  8746	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen, to declare, what is Equity, what is Justice, and what is morall
  8747	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tVertue, and to make them binding, there is need of the Ordinances of
  8748	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign Power, and Punishments to be ordained for such as shall break
  8749	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem; which Ordinances are therefore part of the Civill Law. The Law of
  8750	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNature therefore is a part of the Civill Law in all Common-wealths of
  8751	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe world. Reciprocally also, the Civill Law is a part of the Dictates
  8752	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Nature. For Justice, that is to say, Performance of Covenant, and
  8753	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgiving to every man his own, is a Dictate of the Law of Nature. But
  8754	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevery subject in a Common-wealth, hath covenanted to obey the Civill
  8755	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaw, (either one with another, as when they assemble to make a common
  8756	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRepresentative, or with the Representative it selfe one by one, when
  8757	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsubdued by the Sword they promise obedience, that they may receive
  8758	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlife;) And therefore Obedience to the Civill Law is part also of the
  8759	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaw of Nature. Civill, and Naturall Law are not different kinds, but
  8760	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdifferent parts of Law; whereof one part being written, is called
  8761	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCivill, the other unwritten, Naturall. But the Right of Nature, that
  8762	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis, the naturall Liberty of man, may by the Civill Law be abridged,
  8763	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand restrained: nay, the end of making Lawes, is no other, but such
  8764	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRestraint; without the which there cannot possibly be any Peace. And Law
  8765	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas brought into the world for nothing else, but to limit the naturall
  8766	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tliberty of particular men, in such manner, as they might not hurt, but
  8767	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tassist one another, and joyn together against a common Enemy.

  8772	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tProvinciall Lawes Are Not Made By Custome, But By The Soveraign Power
  8773	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8774	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t5. If the Soveraign of one Common-wealth, subdue a people that have
  8775	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlived under other written Lawes, and afterwards govern them by the
  8776	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsame Lawes, by which they were governed before; yet those Lawes are the
  8777	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCivill Lawes of the Victor, and not of the Vanquished Common-wealth, For
  8778	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Legislator is he, not by whose authority the Lawes were first made,
  8779	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut by whose authority they now continue to be Lawes. And therefore
  8780	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhere there be divers Provinces, within the Dominion of a Common-wealth,
  8781	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand in those Provinces diversity of Lawes, which commonly are called the
  8782	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCustomes of each severall Province, we are not to understand that such
  8783	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCustomes have their Force, onely from Length of Time; but that they were
  8784	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tantiently Lawes written, or otherwise made known, for the Constitutions,
  8785	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Statutes of their Soveraigns; and are now Lawes, not by vertue of
  8786	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Praescription of time, but by the Constitutions of their present
  8787	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraigns. But if an unwritten Law, in all the Provinces of a Dominion,
  8788	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshall be generally observed, and no iniquity appear in the use thereof;
  8789	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat law can be no other but a Law of Nature, equally obliging all
  8790	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman-kind.

  8795	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSome Foolish Opinions Of Lawyers Concerning The Making Of Lawes
  8796	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8797	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t6. Seeing then all Lawes, written, and unwritten, have their Authority,
  8798	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand force, from the Will of the Common-wealth; that is to say, from the
  8799	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWill of the Representative; which in a Monarchy is the Monarch, and
  8800	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin other Common-wealths the Soveraign Assembly; a man may wonder from
  8801	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhence proceed such opinions, as are found in the Books of Lawyers of
  8802	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teminence in severall Common-wealths, directly, or by consequence making
  8803	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Legislative Power depend on private men, or subordinate Judges.
  8804	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAs for example, "That the Common Law, hath no Controuler but the
  8805	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tParlament;" which is true onely where a Parlament has the Soveraign
  8806	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPower, and cannot be assembled, nor dissolved, but by their own
  8807	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdiscretion. For if there be a right in any else to dissolve them, there
  8808	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis a right also to controule them, and consequently to controule their
  8809	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontroulings. And if there be no such right, then the Controuler of
  8810	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLawes is not Parlamentum, but Rex In Parlamento. And where a Parlament
  8811	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis Soveraign, if it should assemble never so many, or so wise men, from
  8812	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Countries subject to them, for whatsoever cause; yet there is no man
  8813	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twill believe, that such an Assembly hath thereby acquired to themselves
  8814	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Legislative Power. Item, that the two arms of a Common-wealth,
  8815	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare Force, and Justice; The First Whereof Is In The King; The Other
  8816	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDeposited In The Hands Of The Parlament. As if a Common-wealth could
  8817	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsist, where the Force were in any hand, which Justice had not the
  8818	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAuthority to command and govern.
  8819	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8820	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t7. That Law can never be against Reason, our Lawyers are agreed; and
  8821	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat not the Letter,(that is, every construction of it,) but that which
  8822	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis according to the Intention of the Legislator, is the Law. And it is
  8823	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttrue: but the doubt is, of whose Reason it is, that shall be received
  8824	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor Law. It is not meant of any private Reason; for then there would be
  8825	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas much contradiction in the Lawes, as there is in the Schooles; nor yet
  8826	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(as Sr. Ed, Coke makes it (Sir Edward Coke, upon Littleton Lib.2. Ch.6
  8827	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfol 97.b),) an Artificiall Perfection of Reason, Gotten By Long Study,
  8828	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tObservation, And Experience, (as his was.) For it is possible long study
  8829	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmay encrease, and confirm erroneous Sentences: and where men build on
  8830	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfalse grounds, the more they build, the greater is the ruine; and of
  8831	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose that study, and observe with equall time, and diligence, the
  8832	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treasons and resolutions are, and must remain discordant: and therefore
  8833	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit is not that Juris Prudentia, or wisedome of subordinate Judges;
  8834	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut the Reason of this our Artificiall Man the Common-wealth, and
  8835	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this Command, that maketh Law: And the Common-wealth being in
  8836	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir Representative but one Person, there cannot easily arise any
  8837	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontradiction in the Lawes; and when there doth, the same Reason is
  8838	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\table, by interpretation, or alteration, to take it away. In all Courts
  8839	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Justice, the Soveraign (which is the Person of the Common-wealth,)
  8840	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis he that Judgeth: The subordinate Judge, ought to have regard to the
  8841	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treason, which moved his Soveraign to make such Law, that his Sentence
  8842	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmay be according thereunto; which then is his Soveraigns Sentence;
  8843	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\totherwise it is his own, and an unjust one.
  8844	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8845	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8846	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8847	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8848	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaw Made, If Not Also Made Known, Is No Law
  8849	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8850	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t8. From this, that the Law is a Command, and a Command consisteth in
  8851	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdeclaration, or manifestation of the will of him that commandeth, by
  8852	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tvoyce, writing, or some other sufficient argument of the same, we may
  8853	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunderstand, that the Command of the Common-wealth, is Law onely to
  8854	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose, that have means to take notice of it. Over naturall fooles,
  8855	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tchildren, or mad-men there is no Law, no more than over brute beasts;
  8856	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnor are they capable of the title of just, or unjust; because they had
  8857	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnever power to make any covenant, or to understand the consequences
  8858	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthereof; and consequently never took upon them to authorise the
  8859	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tactions of any Soveraign, as they must do that make to themselves a
  8860	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth. And as those from whom Nature, or Accident hath taken
  8861	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\taway the notice of all Lawes in generall; so also every man, from whom
  8862	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tany accident, not proceeding from his own default, hath taken away the
  8863	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmeans to take notice of any particular Law, is excused, if he observe it
  8864	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot; And to speak properly, that Law is no Law to him. It is therefore
  8865	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnecessary, to consider in this place, what arguments, and signes be
  8866	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsufficient for the knowledge of what is the Law; that is to say, what is
  8867	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe will of the Soveraign, as well in Monarchies, as in other formes of
  8868	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgovernment.
  8869	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8870	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8871	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8872	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8873	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tUnwritten Lawes Are All Of Them Lawes Of Nature
  8874	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8875	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd first, if it be a Law that obliges all the Subjects without
  8876	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texception, and is not written, nor otherwise published in such places as
  8877	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey may take notice thereof, it is a Law of Nature. For whatsoever men
  8878	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare to take knowledge of for Law, not upon other mens words, but every
  8879	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tone from his own reason, must be such as is agreeable to the reason of
  8880	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall men; which no Law can be, but the Law of Nature. The Lawes of Nature
  8881	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore need not any publishing, nor Proclamation; as being contained
  8882	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin this one Sentence, approved by all the world, "Do not that to
  8883	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tanother, which thou thinkest unreasonable to be done by another to thy
  8884	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tselfe."
  8885	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8886	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSecondly, if it be a Law that obliges only some condition of men, or one
  8887	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tparticular man and be not written, nor published by word, then also it
  8888	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis a Law of Nature; and known by the same arguments, and signs,
  8889	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat distinguish those in such a condition, from other Subjects. For
  8890	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhatsoever Law is not written, or some way published by him that makes
  8891	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit Law, can be known no way, but by the reason of him that is to obey
  8892	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit; and is therefore also a Law not only Civill, but Naturall. For
  8893	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texample, if the Soveraign employ a Publique Minister, without written
  8894	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInstructions what to doe; he is obliged to take for Instructions the
  8895	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDictates of Reason; As if he make a Judge, The Judge is to take notice,
  8896	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat his Sentence ought to be according to the reason of his Soveraign,
  8897	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich being alwaies understood to be Equity, he is bound to it by the
  8898	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaw of Nature: Or if an Ambassador, he is (in al things not conteined
  8899	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin his written Instructions) to take for Instruction that which Reason
  8900	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdictates to be most conducing to his Soveraigns interest; and so of
  8901	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall other Ministers of the Soveraignty, publique and private. All which
  8902	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInstructions of naturall Reason may be comprehended under one name of
  8903	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFidelity; which is a branch of naturall Justice.
  8904	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8905	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Law of Nature excepted, it belongeth to the essence of all other
  8906	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLawes, to be made known, to every man that shall be obliged to obey
  8907	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem, either by word, or writing, or some other act, known to proceed
  8908	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom the Soveraign Authority. For the will of another, cannot be
  8909	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunderstood, but by his own word, or act, or by conjecture taken from his
  8910	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tscope and purpose; which in the person of the Common-wealth, is to be
  8911	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsupposed alwaies consonant to Equity and Reason. And in antient time,
  8912	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbefore letters were in common use, the Lawes were many times put into
  8913	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tverse; that the rude people taking pleasure in singing, or reciting
  8914	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem, might the more easily reteine them in memory. And for the same
  8915	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treason Solomon adviseth a man, to bind the ten Commandements (Prov. 7.
  8916	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t3) upon his ten fingers. And for the Law which Moses gave to the people
  8917	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Israel at the renewing of the Covenant, (Deut. 11. 19) he biddeth
  8918	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem to teach it their Children, by discoursing of it both at home, and
  8919	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tupon the way; at going to bed, and at rising from bed; and to write
  8920	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit upon the posts, and dores of their houses; and (Deut. 31. 12) to
  8921	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tassemble the people, man, woman, and child, to heare it read.
  8922	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8923	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8924	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8925	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8926	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNothing Is Law Where The Legislator Cannot Be Known
  8927	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8928	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNor is it enough the Law be written, and published; but also that there
  8929	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe manifest signs, that it proceedeth from the will of the Soveraign.
  8930	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor private men, when they have, or think they have force enough to
  8931	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsecure their unjust designes, and convoy them safely to their ambitious
  8932	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tends, may publish for Lawes what they please, without, or against
  8933	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Legislative Authority. There is therefore requisite, not only a
  8934	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDeclaration of the Law, but also sufficient signes of the Author, and
  8935	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAuthority. The Author, or Legislator is supposed in every Common-wealth
  8936	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto be evident, because he is the Soveraign, who having been Constituted
  8937	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby the consent of every one, is supposed by every one to be sufficiently
  8938	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tknown. And though the ignorance, and security of men be such, for the
  8939	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmost part, as that when the memory of the first Constitution of their
  8940	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth is worn out, they doe not consider, by whose power they
  8941	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tuse to be defended against their enemies, and to have their industry
  8942	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprotected, and to be righted when injury is done them; yet because no
  8943	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman that considers, can make question of it, no excuse can be derived
  8944	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom the ignorance of where the Soveraignty is placed. And it is a
  8945	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDictate of Naturall Reason, and consequently an evident Law of Nature,
  8946	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat no man ought to weaken that power, the protection whereof he hath
  8947	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thimself demanded, or wittingly received against others. Therefore of
  8948	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twho is Soveraign, no man, but by his own fault, (whatsoever evill men
  8949	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuggest,) can make any doubt. The difficulty consisteth in the evidence
  8950	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Authority derived from him; The removing whereof, dependeth on
  8951	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe knowledge of the publique Registers, publique Counsels, publique
  8952	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMinisters, and publique Seales; by which all Lawes are sufficiently
  8953	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tverified.

  8961	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTestimony and Record; not the Authority of the law; which consisteth in

  8969	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIf therefore a man have a question of Injury, depending on the Law of
  8970	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNature; that is to say, on common Equity; the Sentence of the Judge,
  8971	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat by Commission hath Authority to take cognisance of such causes, is
  8972	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta sufficient Verification of the Law of Nature in that individuall case.
  8973	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor though the advice of one that professeth the study of the Law, be
  8974	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tusefull for the avoyding of contention; yet it is but advice; tis the
  8975	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJudge must tell men what is Law, upon the hearing of the Controversy.

  8981	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  8982	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut when the question is of injury, or crime, upon a written Law; every
  8983	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman by recourse to the Registers, by himself, or others, may (if he
  8984	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twill) be sufficiently enformed, before he doe such injury, or commit the
  8985	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcrime, whither it be an injury, or not: Nay he ought to doe so: for when
  8986	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta man doubts whether the act he goeth about, be just, or injust; and may
  8987	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinforme himself, if he will; the doing is unlawfull. In like manner, he
  8988	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat supposeth himself injured, in a case determined by the written Law,
  8989	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich he may by himself, or others see and consider; if he complaine
  8990	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbefore he consults with the Law, he does unjustly, and bewrayeth a
  8991	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdisposition rather to vex other men, than to demand his own right.

  9000	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thad the means to be informed of it, if a man would, is a sufficient
  9001	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tVerification of his Authority. For every man is obliged to doe his best

  9011	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlight of Nature, sufficiently published; there wanteth yet another
  9012	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tvery materiall circumstance to make them obligatory. For it is not the
  9013	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLetter, but the Intendment, or Meaning; that is to say, the authentique
  9014	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInterpretation of the Law (which is the sense of the Legislator,) in
  9015	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich the nature of the Law consisteth; And therefore the Interpretation

  9017	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcan be none but those, which the Soveraign, (to whom only the
  9018	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSubject oweth obedience) shall appoint. For else, by the craft of an
  9019	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInterpreter, the Law my be made to beare a sense, contrary to that of

  9026	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9027	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAll Laws, written, and unwritten, have need of Interpretation.
  9028	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe unwritten Law of Nature, though it be easy to such, as without
  9029	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpartiality, and passion, make use of their naturall reason, and
  9030	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore leaves the violators thereof without excuse; yet considering
  9031	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere be very few, perhaps none, that in some cases are not blinded by
  9032	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tself love, or some other passion, it is now become of all Laws the most
  9033	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobscure; and has consequently the greatest need of able Interpreters.
  9034	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe written Laws, if they be short, are easily mis-interpreted, from the
  9035	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdivers significations of a word, or two; if long, they be more obscure
  9036	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby the diverse significations of many words: in so much as no written
  9037	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaw, delivered in few, or many words, can be well understood, without a
  9038	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tperfect understanding of the finall causes, for which the Law was
  9039	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmade; the knowledge of which finall causes is in the Legislator. To him
  9040	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore there can not be any knot in the Law, insoluble; either by
  9041	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfinding out the ends, to undoe it by; or else by making what ends he
  9042	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twill, (as Alexander did with his sword in the Gordian knot,) by the

  9057	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit is part of the Civill Law: For though it be naturally reasonable; yet
  9058	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit is by the Soveraigne Power that it is Law: Otherwise, it were a great
  9059	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\terrour, to call the Lawes of Nature unwritten Law; whereof wee see

  9089	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut because there is no Judge Subordinate, nor Soveraign, but may erre
  9090	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin a Judgement of Equity; if afterward in another like case he find it
  9091	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmore consonant to Equity to give a contrary Sentence, he is obliged to
  9092	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdoe it. No mans error becomes his own Law; nor obliges him to persist
  9093	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin it. Neither (for the same reason) becomes it a Law to other Judges,
  9094	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthough sworn to follow it. For though a wrong Sentence given by
  9095	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tauthority of the Soveraign, if he know and allow it, in such Lawes as
  9096	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare mutable, be a constitution of a new Law, in cases, in which every
  9097	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlittle circumstance is the same; yet in Lawes immutable, such as are the
  9098	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLawes of Nature, they are no Lawes to the same, or other Judges, in the
  9099	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlike cases for ever after. Princes succeed one another; and one Judge
  9100	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpasseth, another commeth; nay, Heaven and Earth shall passe; but not one
  9101	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttitle of the Law of Nature shall passe; for it is the Eternall Law of
  9102	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod. Therefore all the Sentences of precedent Judges that have ever
  9103	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeen, cannot all together make a Law contrary to naturall Equity: Nor
  9104	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tany Examples of former Judges, can warrant an unreasonable Sentence, or
  9105	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdischarge the present Judge of the trouble of studying what is Equity
  9106	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(in the case he is to Judge,) from the principles of his own naturall
  9107	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treason. For example sake, 'Tis against the Law of Nature, To Punish The
  9108	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInnocent; and Innocent is he that acquitteth himselfe Judicially, and is
  9109	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tacknowledged for Innocent by the Judge. Put the case now, that a man is
  9110	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\taccused of a capitall crime, and seeing the powers and malice of some
  9111	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tenemy, and the frequent corruption and partiality of Judges, runneth
  9112	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\taway for feare of the event, and afterwards is taken, and brought to a
  9113	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlegall triall, and maketh it sufficiently appear, he was not guilty of
  9114	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe crime, and being thereof acquitted, is neverthelesse condemned to
  9115	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlose his goods; this is a manifest condemnation of the Innocent. I say
  9116	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore, that there is no place in the world, where this can be an
  9117	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinterpretation of a Law of Nature, or be made a Law by the Sentences of
  9118	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprecedent Judges, that had done the same. For he that judged it first,
  9119	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tjudged unjustly; and no Injustice can be a pattern of Judgement to
  9120	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsucceeding Judges. A written Law may forbid innocent men to fly, and
  9121	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey may be punished for flying: But that flying for feare of injury,
  9122	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshould be taken for presumption of guilt, after a man is already
  9123	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tabsolved of the crime Judicially, is contrary to the nature of a
  9124	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPresumption, which hath no place after Judgement given. Yet this is set
  9125	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdown by a great Lawyer for the common Law of England. "If a man," saith
  9126	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the, "that is Innocent, be accused of Felony, and for feare flyeth for
  9127	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe same; albeit he judicially acquitteth himselfe of the Felony; yet
  9128	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tif it be found that he fled for the Felony, he shall notwithstanding his
  9129	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInnocency, Forfeit all his goods, chattels, debts, and duties. For as
  9130	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto the Forfeiture of them, the Law will admit no proofe against the
  9131	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPresumption in Law, grounded upon his flight." Here you see, An Innocent
  9132	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMan, Judicially Acquitted, Notwithstanding His Innocency, (when no
  9133	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twritten Law forbad him to fly) after his acquitall, Upon A Presumption
  9134	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn Law, condemned to lose all the goods he hath. If the Law ground upon
  9135	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this flight a Presumption of the fact, (which was Capitall,) the Sentence
  9136	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tought to have been Capitall: if the presumption were not of the Fact,
  9137	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor what then ought he to lose his goods? This therefore is no Law of
  9138	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEngland; nor is the condemnation grounded upon a Presumption of Law, but
  9139	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tupon the Presumption of the Judges. It is also against Law, to say
  9140	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat no Proofe shall be admitted against a Presumption of Law. For
  9141	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall Judges, Soveraign and subordinate, if they refuse to heare Proofe,
  9142	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trefuse to do Justice: for though the Sentence be Just, yet the Judges
  9143	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat condemn without hearing the Proofes offered, are Unjust Judges; and
  9144	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir Presumption is but Prejudice; which no man ought to bring with him
  9145	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto the Seat of Justice, whatsoever precedent judgements, or examples he
  9146	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshall pretend to follow. There be other things of this nature, wherein
  9147	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmens Judgements have been perverted, by trusting to Precedents: but this
  9148	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis enough to shew, that though the Sentence of the Judge, be a Law to
  9149	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe party pleading, yet it is no Law to any Judge, that shall succeed
  9150	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim in that Office.
  9151	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9152	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn like manner, when question is of the Meaning of written Lawes, he is
  9153	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot the Interpreter of them, that writeth a Commentary upon them. For
  9154	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommentaries are commonly more subject to cavill, than the Text; and
  9155	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore need other Commentaries; and so there will be no end of such
  9156	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInterpretation. And therefore unlesse there be an Interpreter authorised
  9157	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby the Soveraign, from which the subordinate Judges are not to recede,
  9158	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Interpreter can be no other than the ordinary Judges, in the some
  9159	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmanner, as they are in cases of the unwritten Law; and their Sentences
  9160	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare to be taken by them that plead, for Lawes in that particular case;
  9161	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut not to bind other Judges, in like cases to give like judgements.
  9162	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor a Judge may erre in the Interpretation even of written Lawes; but no
  9163	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\terrour of a subordinate Judge, can change the Law, which is the generall
  9164	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSentence of the Soveraigne.

  9169	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Difference Between The Letter And Sentence Of The Law
  9170	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9171	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn written Lawes, men use to make a difference between the Letter, and
  9172	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Sentence of the Law: And when by the Letter, is meant whatsoever
  9173	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcan be gathered from the bare words, 'tis well distinguished. For the
  9174	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsignifications of almost all words, are either in themselves, or in the
  9175	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmetaphoricall use of them, ambiguous; and may be drawn in argument, to
  9176	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmake many senses; but there is onely one sense of the Law. But if by the
  9177	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLetter, be meant the Literall sense, then the Letter, and the Sentence
  9178	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor intention of the Law, is all one. For the literall sense is that,
  9179	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich the Legislator is alwayes supposed to be Equity: For it were a
  9180	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgreat contumely for a Judge to think otherwise of the Soveraigne.
  9181	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHe ought therefore, if the Word of the Law doe not fully authorise a
  9182	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treasonable Sentence, to supply it with the Law of Nature; or if the
  9183	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcase be difficult, to respit Judgement till he have received more ample
  9184	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tauthority. For Example, a written Law ordaineth, that he which is thrust
  9185	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tout of his house by force, shall be restored by force: It happens that
  9186	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta man by negligence leaves his house empty, and returning is kept out by
  9187	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tforce, in which case there is no speciall Law ordained. It is evident,
  9188	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat this case is contained in the same Law: for else there is no remedy
  9189	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor him at all; which is to be supposed against the Intention of the
  9190	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLegislator. Again, the word of the Law, commandeth to Judge according
  9191	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto the Evidence: A man is accused falsly of a fact, which the Judge saw
  9192	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thimself done by another; and not by him that is accused. In this case
  9193	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tneither shall the Letter of the Law be followed to the condemnation of
  9194	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Innocent, nor shall the Judge give Sentence against the evidence
  9195	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Witnesses; because the Letter of the Law is to the contrary:
  9196	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut procure of the Soveraign that another be made Judge, and himselfe
  9197	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWitnesse. So that the incommodity that follows the bare words of a
  9198	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twritten Law, may lead him to the Intention of the Law, whereby to
  9199	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinterpret the same the better; though no Incommodity can warrant a
  9200	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSentence against the Law. For every Judge of Right, and Wrong, is not
  9201	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJudge of what is Commodious, or Incommodious to the Common-wealth.

  9206	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Abilities Required In A Judge
  9207	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9208	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe abilities required in a good Interpreter of the Law, that is to say,
  9209	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin a good Judge, are not the same with those of an Advocate; namely the
  9210	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tstudy of the Lawes. For a Judge, as he ought to take notice of the Fact,
  9211	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom none but the Witnesses; so also he ought to take notice of the
  9212	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaw, from nothing but the Statutes, and Constitutions of the Soveraign,
  9213	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talledged in the pleading, or declared to him by some that have authority
  9214	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom the Soveraign Power to declare them; and need not take care
  9215	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbefore-hand, what hee shall Judge; for it shall bee given him what hee
  9216	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshall say concerning the Fact, by Witnesses; and what hee shall say in
  9217	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpoint of Law, from those that shall in their pleadings shew it, and by
  9218	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tauthority interpret it upon the place. The Lords of Parlament in England
  9219	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere Judges, and most difficult causes have been heard and determined
  9220	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby them; yet few of them were much versed in the study of the Lawes,
  9221	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand fewer had made profession of them: and though they consulted with
  9222	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLawyers, that were appointed to be present there for that purpose; yet
  9223	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey alone had the authority of giving Sentence. In like manner, in
  9224	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe ordinary trialls of Right, Twelve men of the common People, are the
  9225	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJudges, and give Sentence, not onely of the Fact, but of the Right; and
  9226	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpronounce simply for the Complaynant, or for the Defendant; that is to
  9227	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsay, are Judges not onely of the Fact, but also of the Right: and in a
  9228	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tquestion of crime, not onely determine whether done, or not done; but
  9229	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talso whether it be Murder, Homicide, Felony, Assault, and the like,
  9230	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich are determinations of Law: but because they are not supposed to
  9231	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tknow the Law of themselves, there is one that hath Authority to enforme
  9232	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem of it, in the particular case they are to Judge of. But yet if they
  9233	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tjudge not according to that he tells them, they are not subject thereby
  9234	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto any penalty; unlesse it be made appear, they did it against their
  9235	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsciences, or had been corrupted by reward. The things that make
  9236	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta good Judge, or good Interpreter of the Lawes, are, first A Right
  9237	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tUnderstanding of that principall Law of Nature called Equity; which
  9238	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdepending not on the reading of other mens Writings, but on the
  9239	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgoodnesse of a mans own naturall Reason, and Meditation, is presumed
  9240	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto be in those most, that have had most leisure, and had the most
  9241	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinclination to meditate thereon. Secondly, Contempt Of Unnecessary
  9242	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRiches, and Preferments. Thirdly, To Be Able In Judgement To Devest
  9243	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHimselfe Of All Feare, Anger, Hatred, Love, And Compassion. Fourthly,
  9244	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand lastly, Patience To Heare; Diligent Attention In Hearing; And Memory
  9245	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo Retain, Digest And Apply What He Hath Heard.

  9250	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDivisions Of Law
  9251	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9252	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe difference and division of the Lawes, has been made in divers
  9253	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmanners, according to the different methods, of those men that have
  9254	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twritten of them. For it is a thing that dependeth not on Nature, but on
  9255	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe scope of the Writer; and is subservient to every mans proper method.
  9256	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn the Institutions of Justinian, we find seven sorts of Civill Lawes.
  9257	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9258	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t1. The Edicts, Constitutions, and Epistles Of The Prince, that is, of
  9259	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Emperour; because the whole power of the people was in him. Like
  9260	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthese, are the Proclamations of the Kings of England.
  9261	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9262	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t2. The Decrees Of The Whole People Of Rome (comprehending the Senate,)
  9263	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhen they were put to the Question by the Senate. These were Lawes, at
  9264	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfirst, by the vertue of the Soveraign Power residing in the people; and
  9265	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch of them as by the Emperours were not abrogated, remained Lawes by
  9266	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Authority Imperiall. For all Lawes that bind, are understood to be
  9267	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLawes by his authority that has power to repeale them. Somewhat like to
  9268	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthese Lawes, are the Acts of Parliament in England.
  9269	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9270	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t3. The Decrees Of The Common People (excluding the Senate,) when they
  9271	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere put to the question by the Tribune of the people. For such of them
  9272	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas were not abrogated by the Emperours, remained Lawes by the Authority
  9273	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tImperiall. Like to these, were the Orders of the House of Commons in
  9274	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEngland.
  9275	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9276	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t4. Senatus Consulta, the Orders Of The Senate; because when the people
  9277	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Rome grew so numerous, as it was inconvenient to assemble them; it
  9278	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas thought fit by the Emperour, that men should Consult the Senate in
  9279	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tstead of the people: And these have some resemblance with the Acts of
  9280	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCounsell.
  9281	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9282	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t5. The Edicts Of Praetors, and (in some Cases) of the Aediles: such as
  9283	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare the Chiefe Justices in the Courts of England.
  9284	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9285	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t6. Responsa Prudentum; which were the Sentences, and Opinions of those
  9286	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLawyers, to whom the Emperour gave Authority to interpret the Law, and
  9287	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto give answer to such as in matter of Law demanded their advice;
  9288	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich Answers, the Judges in giving Judgement were obliged by the
  9289	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConstitutions of the Emperour to observe; And should be like the Reports
  9290	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Cases Judged, if other Judges be by the Law of England bound to
  9291	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobserve them. For the Judges of the Common Law of England, are not
  9292	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tproperly Judges, but Juris Consulti; of whom the Judges, who are either
  9293	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Lords, or Twelve men of the Country, are in point of Law to ask
  9294	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tadvice.
  9295	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9296	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t7. Also, Unwritten Customes, (which in their own nature are an imitation
  9297	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Law,) by the tacite consent of the Emperour, in case they be not
  9298	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontrary to the Law of Nature, are very Lawes.
  9299	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9300	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnother division of Lawes, is into Naturall and Positive. Naturall are
  9301	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose which have been Lawes from all Eternity; and are called not onely
  9302	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNaturall, but also Morall Lawes; consisting in the Morall Vertues, as
  9303	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJustice, Equity, and all habits of the mind that conduce to Peace, and
  9304	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCharity; of which I have already spoken in the fourteenth and fifteenth
  9305	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChapters.
  9306	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9307	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPositive, are those which have not been for Eternity; but have been
  9308	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmade Lawes by the Will of those that have had the Soveraign Power over
  9309	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tothers; and are either written, or made known to men, by some other
  9310	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\targument of the Will of their Legislator.
  9311	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9312	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9313	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9314	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9315	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnother Division Of Law
  9316	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9317	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAgain, of Positive Lawes some are Humane, some Divine; And of Humane
  9318	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpositive lawes, some are Distributive, some Penal. Distributive are
  9319	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose that determine the Rights of the Subjects, declaring to every man
  9320	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhat it is, by which he acquireth and holdeth a propriety in lands,
  9321	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor goods, and a right or liberty of action; and these speak to all
  9322	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Subjects. Penal are those, which declare, what Penalty shall be
  9323	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinflicted on those that violate the Law; and speak to the Ministers
  9324	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Officers ordained for execution. For though every one ought to be
  9325	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinformed of the Punishments ordained beforehand for their transgression;
  9326	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tneverthelesse the Command is not addressed to the Delinquent, (who
  9327	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcannot be supposed will faithfully punish himselfe,) but to publique
  9328	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMinisters appointed to see the Penalty executed. And these Penal Lawes
  9329	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare for the most part written together with the Lawes Distributive; and
  9330	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare sometimes called Judgements. For all Lawes are generall judgements,
  9331	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor Sentences of the Legislator; as also every particular Judgement, is a
  9332	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaw to him, whose case is Judged.

  9337	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDivine Positive Law How Made Known To Be Law
  9338	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9339	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDivine Positive Lawes (for Naturall Lawes being Eternall, and
  9340	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tUniversall, are all Divine,) are those, which being the Commandements of
  9341	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod, (not from all Eternity, nor universally addressed to all men, but
  9342	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tonely to a certain people, or to certain persons,) are declared for
  9343	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch, by those whom God hath authorised to declare them. But this
  9344	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAuthority of man to declare what be these Positive Lawes of God, how can
  9345	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit be known? God may command a man by a supernaturall way, to deliver
  9346	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLawes to other men. But because it is of the essence of Law, that he who
  9347	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis to be obliged, be assured of the Authority of him that declareth
  9348	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit, which we cannot naturally take notice to be from God, How Can A Man
  9349	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWithout Supernaturall Revelation Be Assured Of The Revelation Received
  9350	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBy The Declarer? and How Can He Be Bound To Obey Them? For the first
  9351	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tquestion, how a man can be assured of the Revelation of another, without
  9352	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Revelation particularly to himselfe, it is evidently impossible:
  9353	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor though a man may be induced to believe such Revelation, from the
  9354	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMiracles they see him doe, or from seeing the Extraordinary sanctity of
  9355	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this life, or from seeing the Extraordinary wisedome, or Extraordinary
  9356	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfelicity of his Actions, all which are marks of Gods extraordinary
  9357	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfavour; yet they are not assured evidence of speciall Revelation.
  9358	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMiracles are Marvellous workes: but that which is marvellous to one,
  9359	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmay not be so to another. Sanctity may be feigned; and the visible
  9360	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfelicities of this world, are most often the work of God by Naturall,
  9361	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand ordinary causes. And therefore no man can infallibly know by
  9362	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnaturall reason, that another has had a supernaturall revelation of Gods
  9363	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twill; but only a beliefe; every one (as the signs thereof shall appear
  9364	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgreater, or lesser) a firmer, or a weaker belief.
  9365	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9366	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut for the second, how he can be bound to obey them; it is not so hard.
  9367	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor if the Law declared, be not against the Law of Nature (which is
  9368	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tundoubtedly Gods Law) and he undertake to obey it, he is bound by his
  9369	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\town act; bound I say to obey it, but not bound to believe it: for mens
  9370	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeliefe, and interiour cogitations, are not subject to the commands,
  9371	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut only to the operation of God, ordinary, or extraordinary. Faith of
  9372	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSupernaturall Law, is not a fulfilling, but only an assenting to the
  9373	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsame; and not a duty that we exhibite to God, but a gift which God
  9374	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfreely giveth to whom he pleaseth; as also Unbelief is not a breach
  9375	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof any of his Lawes; but a rejection of them all, except the Lawes
  9376	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNaturall. But this that I say, will be made yet cleerer, by the
  9377	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tExamples, and Testimonies concerning this point in holy Scripture. The
  9378	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCovenant God made with Abraham (in a Supernaturall Manner) was thus,
  9379	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(Gen. 17. 10) "This is the Covenant which thou shalt observe between
  9380	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMe and Thee and thy Seed after thee." Abrahams Seed had not this
  9381	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trevelation, nor were yet in being; yet they are a party to the Covenant,
  9382	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand bound to obey what Abraham should declare to them for Gods Law;
  9383	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich they could not be, but in vertue of the obedience they owed to
  9384	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir Parents; who (if they be Subject to no other earthly power, as
  9385	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\there in the case of Abraham) have Soveraign power over their children,
  9386	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand servants. Againe, where God saith to Abraham, "In thee shall all
  9387	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNations of the earth be blessed: For I know thou wilt command thy
  9388	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tchildren, and thy house after thee to keep the way of the Lord, and to
  9389	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobserve Righteousnesse and Judgement," it is manifest, the obedience of
  9390	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this Family, who had no Revelation, depended on their former obligation
  9391	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto obey their Soveraign. At Mount Sinai Moses only went up to God; the
  9392	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpeople were forbidden to approach on paine of death; yet were they bound
  9393	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto obey all that Moses declared to them for Gods Law. Upon what ground,
  9394	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut on this submission of their own, "Speak thou to us, and we will
  9395	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\theare thee; but let not God speak to us, lest we dye?" By which two
  9396	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tplaces it sufficiently appeareth, that in a Common-wealth, a subject
  9397	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat has no certain and assured Revelation particularly to himself
  9398	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconcerning the Will of God, is to obey for such, the Command of
  9399	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Common-wealth: for if men were at liberty, to take for Gods
  9400	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommandements, their own dreams, and fancies, or the dreams and
  9401	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfancies of private men; scarce two men would agree upon what is Gods
  9402	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommandement; and yet in respect of them, every man would despise the
  9403	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommandements of the Common-wealth. I conclude therefore, that in all
  9404	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthings not contrary to the Morall Law, (that is to say, to the Law of
  9405	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNature,) all Subjects are bound to obey that for divine Law, which is
  9406	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdeclared to be so, by the Lawes of the Common-wealth. Which also is
  9407	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevident to any mans reason; for whatsoever is not against the Law of
  9408	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNature, may be made Law in the name of them that have the Soveraign
  9409	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpower; and there is no reason men should be the lesse obliged by it,
  9410	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhen tis propounded in the name of God. Besides, there is no place in
  9411	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe world where men are permitted to pretend other Commandements of God,
  9412	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthan are declared for such by the Common-wealth. Christian States punish
  9413	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose that revolt from Christian Religion, and all other States, those
  9414	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat set up any Religion by them forbidden. For in whatsoever is not
  9415	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tregulated by the Common-wealth, tis Equity (which is the Law of Nature,
  9416	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand therefore an eternall Law of God) that every man equally enjoy his
  9417	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tliberty.

  9422	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnother Division Of Lawes
  9423	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9424	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThere is also another distinction of Laws, into Fundamentall, and Not
  9425	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFundamentall: but I could never see in any Author, what a Fundamentall
  9426	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaw signifieth. Neverthelesse one may very reasonably distinguish Laws
  9427	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin that manner.
  9428	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t

  9430	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9431	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9432	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tA Fundamentall Law What
  9433	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9434	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor a Fundamentall Law in every Common-wealth is that, which being taken
  9435	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\taway, the Common-wealth faileth, and is utterly dissolved; as a building
  9436	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhose Foundation is destroyed. And therefore a Fundamentall Law is that,
  9437	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby which Subjects are bound to uphold whatsoever power is given to the
  9438	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign, whether a Monarch, or a Soveraign Assembly, without which the
  9439	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth cannot stand, such as is the power of War and Peace, of
  9440	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJudicature, of Election of Officers, and of doing whatsoever he shall
  9441	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthink necessary for the Publique good. Not Fundamentall is that
  9442	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe abrogating whereof, draweth not with it the dissolution of the
  9443	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-Wealth; such as are the Lawes Concerning Controversies between
  9444	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsubject and subject. Thus much of the Division of Lawes.

  9448	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9449	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDifference Between Law And Right
  9450	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9451	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tI find the words Lex Civilis, and Jus Civile, that is to say, Law and
  9452	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRight Civil, promiscuously used for the same thing, even in the most
  9453	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlearned Authors; which neverthelesse ought not to be so. For Right is
  9454	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLiberty, namely that Liberty which the Civil Law leaves us: But Civill
  9455	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaw is an Obligation; and takes from us the Liberty which the Law of
  9456	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNature gave us. Nature gave a Right to every man to secure himselfe
  9457	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby his own strength, and to invade a suspected neighbour, by way of
  9458	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprevention; but the Civill Law takes away that Liberty, in all cases
  9459	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhere the protection of the Lawe may be safely stayd for. Insomuch as
  9460	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLex and Jus, are as different as Obligation and Liberty.
  9461	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t

  9464	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9465	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd Between A Law And A Charter
  9466	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9467	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLikewise Lawes and Charters are taken promiscuously for the same
  9468	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthing. Yet Charters are Donations of the Soveraign; and not Lawes, but
  9469	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texemptions from Law. The phrase of a Law is Jubeo, Injungo, I Command,
  9470	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Enjoyn: the phrase of a Charter is Dedi, Concessi, I Have Given, I
  9471	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHave Granted: but what is given or granted, to a man, is not forced
  9472	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tupon him, by a Law. A Law may be made to bind All the Subjects of a
  9473	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth: a Liberty, or Charter is only to One man, or some One
  9474	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpart of the people. For to say all the people of a Common-wealth, have
  9475	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLiberty in any case whatsoever; is to say, that in such case, there hath
  9476	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeen no Law made; or else having been made, is now abrogated.

  9481	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9482	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9483	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9484	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSinne What
  9485	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9486	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tA Sinne, is not onely a Transgression of a Law, but also any Contempt of
  9487	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Legislator. For such Contempt, is a breach of all his Lawes at once.
  9488	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd therefore may consist, not onely in the Commission of a Fact, or in
  9489	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Speaking of Words by the Lawes forbidden, or in the Omission of
  9490	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhat the Law commandeth, but also in the Intention, or purpose to
  9491	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttransgresse. For the purpose to breake the Law, is some degree of
  9492	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tContempt of him, to whom it belongeth to see it executed. To be
  9493	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdelighted in the Imagination onely, of being possessed of another mans
  9494	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgoods, servants, or wife, without any intention to take them from him
  9495	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby force, or fraud, is no breach of the Law, that sayth, "Thou shalt not
  9496	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcovet:" nor is the pleasure a man my have in imagining, or dreaming of
  9497	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe death of him, from whose life he expecteth nothing but dammage, and
  9498	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdispleasure, a Sinne; but the resolving to put some Act in execution,
  9499	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat tendeth thereto. For to be pleased in the fiction of that, which
  9500	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twould please a man if it were reall, is a Passion so adhaerent to the
  9501	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNature both of a man, and every other living creature, as to make it a
  9502	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSinne, were to make Sinne of being a man. The consideration of this,
  9503	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thas made me think them too severe, both to themselves, and others, that
  9504	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmaintain, that the First motions of the mind, (though checked with the
  9505	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfear of God) be Sinnes. But I confesse it is safer to erre on that hand,
  9506	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthan on the other.
  9507	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9508	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9509	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9510	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9511	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tA Crime What
  9512	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9513	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tA Crime, is a sinne, consisting in the Committing (by Deed, or Word)
  9514	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof that which the Law forbiddeth, or the Omission of what it hath
  9515	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommanded. So that every Crime is a sinne; but not every sinne a Crime.
  9516	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo intend to steale, or kill, is a sinne, though it never appeare in
  9517	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWord, or Fact: for God that seeth the thoughts of man, can lay it to
  9518	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this charge: but till it appear by some thing done, or said, by which
  9519	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe intention may be Crime; which distinction the Greeks observed in
  9520	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe word amartema, and egklema, or aitia; wherof the former, (which is
  9521	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttranslated Sinne,) signifieth any swarving from the Law whatsoever; but
  9522	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe two later, (which are translated Crime,) signifie that sinne onely,
  9523	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhereof one man may accuse another. But of Intentions, which never
  9524	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tappear by any outward act, there is no place for humane accusation. In
  9525	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlike manner the Latines by Peccatum, which is Sinne, signifie all manner
  9526	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof deviation from the Law; but by crimen, (which word they derive from
  9527	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCerno, which signifies to perceive,) they mean onely such sinnes, as my
  9528	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe made appear before a Judge; and therfore are not meer Intentions.
  9529	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t

  9531	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9532	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9533	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhere No Civill Law Is, There Is No Crime
  9534	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9535	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFrom this relation of Sinne to the Law, and of Crime to the Civill
  9536	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaw, may be inferred, First, that where Law ceaseth, Sinne ceaseth.
  9537	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut because the Law of Nature is eternall, Violation of Covenants,
  9538	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIngratitude, Arrogance, and all Facts contrary to any Morall vertue, can
  9539	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnever cease to be Sinne. Secondly, that the Civill Law ceasing, Crimes
  9540	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcease: for there being no other Law remaining, but that of Nature, there
  9541	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis no place for Accusation; every man being his own Judge, and accused
  9542	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tonely by his own Conscience, and cleared by the Uprightnesse of his own
  9543	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIntention. When therefore his Intention is Right, his fact is no Sinne:
  9544	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tif otherwise, his fact is Sinne; but not Crime. Thirdly, That when the
  9545	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign Power ceaseth, Crime also ceaseth: for where there is no such
  9546	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPower, there is no protection to be had from the Law; and therefore
  9547	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevery one may protect himself by his own power: for no man in the
  9548	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInstitution of Soveraign Power can be supposed to give away the Right
  9549	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof preserving his own body; for the safety whereof all Soveraignty was
  9550	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tordained. But this is to be understood onely of those, that have not
  9551	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthemselves contributed to the taking away of the Power that protected
  9552	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem: for that was a Crime from the beginning.

  9555	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9556	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9557	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIgnorance Of The Law Of Nature Excuseth No Man
  9558	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9559	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe source of every Crime, is some defect of the Understanding; or some
  9560	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\terrour in Reasoning, or some sudden force of the Passions. Defect in
  9561	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Understanding, is Ignorance; in Reasoning, Erroneous Opinion. Again,
  9562	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tignorance is of three sort; of the Law, and of the Soveraign, and of the
  9563	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPenalty. Ignorance of the Law of Nature Excuseth no man; because every
  9564	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman that hath attained to the use of Reason, is supposed to know, he
  9565	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tought not to do to another, what he would not have done to himselfe.
  9566	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTherefore into what place soever a man shall come, if he do any thing
  9567	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontrary to that Law, it is a Crime. If a man come from the Indies
  9568	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thither, and perswade men here to receive a new Religion, or teach them
  9569	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tany thing that tendeth to disobedience of the Lawes of this Country,
  9570	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthough he be never so well perswaded of the truth of what he teacheth,
  9571	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the commits a Crime, and may be justly punished for the same, not onely
  9572	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbecause his doctrine is false, but also because he does that which he
  9573	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twould not approve in another, namely, that comming from hence, he should
  9574	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tendeavour to alter the Religion there. But ignorance of the Civill Law,
  9575	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshall Excuse a man in a strange Country, till it be declared to him;
  9576	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbecause, till then no Civill Law is binding.

  9583	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn the like manner, if the Civill Law of a mans own Country, be not
  9584	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tso sufficiently declared, as he may know it if he will; nor the Action
  9585	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagainst the Law of Nature; the Ignorance is a good Excuse: In other

  9593	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIgnorance of the Soveraign Power, in the place of a mans ordinary

  9602	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIgnorance of the Penalty, where the Law is declared, Excuseth no man:
  9603	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor in breaking the Law, which without a fear of penalty to follow, were
  9604	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot a Law, but vain words, he undergoeth the penalty, though he know not
  9605	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhat it is; because, whosoever voluntarily doth any action, accepteth
  9606	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall the known consequences of it; but Punishment is a known consequence
  9607	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the violation of the Lawes, in every Common-wealth; which punishment,
  9608	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tif it be determined already by the Law, he is subject to that; if not,
  9609	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthen is he subject to Arbitrary punishment. For it is reason, that he
  9610	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich does Injury, without other limitation than that of his own Will,
  9611	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshould suffer punishment without other limitation, than that of his Will

  9622	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor hath been usually inflicted in the like cases; there the Delinquent
  9623	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis Excused from a greater penalty. For the punishment foreknown, if not
  9624	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgreat enough to deterre men from the action, is an invitement to it:
  9625	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbecause when men compare the benefit of their Injustice, with the harm
  9626	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof their punishment, by necessity of Nature they choose that which
  9627	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tappeareth best for themselves; and therefore when they are punished more
  9628	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthan the Law had formerly determined, or more than others were punished
  9629	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor the same Crime; it the Law that tempted, and deceiveth them.

  9653	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin all ages, unjust Actions have been authorised, by the force, and
  9654	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tvictories of those who have committed them; and that potent men,

  9656	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand those that have failed in their Enterprises, have been esteemed the
  9657	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tonely Criminals; have thereupon taken for Principles, and grounds of
  9658	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir Reasoning, "That Justice is but a vain word: That whatsoever a man
  9659	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcan get by his own Industry, and hazard, is his own: That the Practice
  9660	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof all Nations cannot be unjust: That examples of former times are good

  9702	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf the Passions that most frequently are the causes of Crime, one,
  9703	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis Vain-glory, or a foolish over-rating of their own worth; as if
  9704	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdifference of worth, were an effect of their wit, or riches, or bloud,
  9705	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor some other naturall quality, not depending on the Will of those that
  9706	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave the Soveraign Authority. From whence proceedeth a Presumption that
  9707	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe punishments ordained by the Lawes, and extended generally to all
  9708	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSubjects, ought not to be inflicted on them, with the same rigour they

  9742	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprone to all such Crimes, as consist in Craft, and in deceiving of their
  9743	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNeighbours; because they think their designes are too subtile to be
  9744	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tperceived. These I say are effects of a false presumption of their own
  9745	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWisdome. For of them that are the first movers in the disturbance of
  9746	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth, (which can never happen without a Civill Warre,) very few
  9747	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare left alive long enough, to see their new Designes established: so
  9748	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat the benefit of their Crimes, redoundeth to Posterity, and such as
  9749	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twould least have wished it: which argues they were not as wise, as
  9750	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey thought they were. And those that deceive upon hope of not being
  9751	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobserved, do commonly deceive themselves, (the darknesse in which they
  9752	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbelieve they lye hidden, being nothing else but their own blindnesse;)
  9753	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand are no wiser than Children, that think all hid, by hiding their own
  9754	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teyes.
  9755	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9756	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd generally all vain-glorious men, (unlesse they be withall timorous,)
  9757	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare subject to Anger; as being more prone than others to interpret for
  9758	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontempt, the ordinary liberty of conversation: And there are few Crimes
  9759	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat may not be produced by Anger.

  9764	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHatred, Lust, Ambition, Covetousnesse, Causes Of Crime
  9765	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9766	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAs for the Passions, of Hate, Lust, Ambition, and Covetousnesse, what
  9767	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCrimes they are apt to produce, is so obvious to every mans experience
  9768	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand understanding, as there needeth nothing to be said of them, saving
  9769	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat they are infirmities, so annexed to the nature, both of man, and
  9770	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall other living creatures, as that their effects cannot be hindred,
  9771	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut by extraordinary use of Reason, or a constant severity in punishing
  9772	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem. For in those things men hate, they find a continuall, and
  9773	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunavoydable molestation; whereby either a mans patience must be
  9774	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teverlasting, or he must be eased by removing the power of that which
  9775	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmolesteth him; The former is difficult; the later is many times
  9776	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\timpossible, without some violation of the Law. Ambition, and
  9777	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCovetousnesse are Passions also that are perpetually incumbent, and
  9778	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpressing; whereas Reason is not perpetually present, to resist them:
  9779	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand therefore whensoever the hope of impunity appears, their effects
  9780	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tproceed. And for Lust, what it wants in the lasting, it hath in the
  9781	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tvehemence, which sufficeth to weigh down the apprehension of all easie,
  9782	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor uncertain punishments.

  9788	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9789	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNor Corporeall
  9790	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9791	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf all Passions, that which enclineth men least to break the Lawes, is
  9792	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFear. Nay, (excepting some generous natures,) it is the onely thing,
  9793	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(when there is apparence of profit, or pleasure by breaking the Lawes,)
  9794	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat makes men keep them. And yet in many cases a Crime may be committed
  9795	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthrough Feare.
  9796	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9797	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor not every Fear justifies the Action it produceth, but the fear onely
  9798	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof corporeall hurt, which we call Bodily Fear, and from which a man
  9799	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcannot see how to be delivered, but by the action. A man is assaulted,
  9800	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfears present death, from which he sees not how to escape, but by
  9801	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twounding him that assaulteth him; If he wound him to death, this is no
  9802	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCrime; because no man is supposed at the making of a Common-wealth, to
  9803	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave abandoned the defence of his life, or limbes, where the Law cannot
  9804	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tarrive time enough to his assistance. But to kill a man, because from
  9805	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this actions, or his threatnings, I may argue he will kill me when he
  9806	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcan, (seeing I have time, and means to demand protection, from the
  9807	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign Power,) is a Crime. Again, a man receives words of disgrace,
  9808	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor some little injuries (for which they that made the Lawes, had
  9809	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tassigned no punishment, nor thought it worthy of a man that hath the use
  9810	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Reason, to take notice of,) and is afraid, unlesse he revenge it,
  9811	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the shall fall into contempt, and consequently be obnoxious to the like
  9812	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinjuries from others; and to avoyd this, breaks the Law, and protects
  9813	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thimselfe for the future, by the terrour of his private revenge. This is
  9814	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Crime; For the hurt is not Corporeall, but Phantasticall, and (though
  9815	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin this corner of the world, made sensible by a custome not many years
  9816	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsince begun, amongst young and vain men,) so light, as a gallant man,
  9817	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand one that is assured of his own courage, cannot take notice of. Also
  9818	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta man may stand in fear of Spirits, either through his own superstition,
  9819	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor through too much credit given to other men, that tell him of strange
  9820	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDreams and visions; and thereby be made believe they will hurt him, for
  9821	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdoing, or omitting divers things, which neverthelesse, to do, or omit,
  9822	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis contrary to the Lawes; And that which is so done, or omitted, is not
  9823	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto be Excused by this fear; but is a Crime. For (as I have shewn before
  9824	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the second Chapter) Dreams be naturally but the fancies remaining in
  9825	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsleep, after the impressions our Senses had formerly received waking;
  9826	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand when men are by any accident unassured they have slept, seem to be
  9827	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treall Visions; and therefore he that presumes to break the Law upon his
  9828	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\town, or anothers Dream, or pretended Vision, or upon other Fancy of
  9829	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe power of Invisible Spirits, than is permitted by the Common-wealth,
  9830	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tleaveth the Law of Nature, which is a certain offence, and followeth the
  9831	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\timagery of his own, or another private mans brain, which he can never
  9832	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tknow whether it signifieth any thing, or nothing, nor whether he that
  9833	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttells his Dream, say true, or lye; which if every private man should
  9834	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave leave to do, (as they must by the Law of Nature, if any one have
  9835	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit) there could no Law be made to hold, and so all Common-wealth would

  9843	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFrom these different sources of Crimes, it appeares already, that all
  9844	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCrimes are not (as the Stoicks of old time maintained) of the same
  9845	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tallay. There is place, not only for EXCUSE, by which that which seemed
  9846	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Crime, is proved to be none at all; but also for EXTENUATION, by which
  9847	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Crime, that seemed great, is made lesse. For though all Crimes doe
  9848	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tequally deserve the name of Injustice, as all deviation from a strait
  9849	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tline is equally crookednesse, which the Stoicks rightly observed; yet

  9862	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobligation of the Law. For the fact committed once against the Law,
  9863	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tif he that committed it be obliged to the Law, can be no other than a
  9864	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCrime.
  9865	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9866	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe want of means to know the Law, totally Excuseth: For the Law whereof
  9867	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta man has no means to enforme himself, is not obligatory. But the want
  9868	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof diligence to enquire, shall not be considered as a want of means; Nor
  9869	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshall any man, that pretendeth to reason enough for the Government of
  9870	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this own affairs, be supposed to want means to know the Lawes of Nature;
  9871	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbecause they are known by the reason he pretends to: only Children, and
  9872	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMadmen are Excused from offences against the Law Naturall.
  9873	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9874	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhere a man is captive, or in the power of the enemy, (and he is then in
  9875	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe power of the enemy, when his person, or his means of living, is
  9876	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tso,) if it be without his own fault, the Obligation of the Law ceaseth;
  9877	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbecause he must obey the enemy, or dye; and consequently such obedience
  9878	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis no Crime: for no man is obliged (when the protection of the Law
  9879	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfaileth,) not to protect himself, by the best means he can.
  9880	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9881	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIf a man by the terrour of present death, be compelled to doe a fact
  9882	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagainst the Law, he is totally Excused; because no Law can oblige a
  9883	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman to abandon his own preservation. And supposing such a Law were
  9884	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobligatory; yet a man would reason thus, "If I doe it not, I die
  9885	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpresently; if I doe it, I die afterwards; therefore by doing it, there
  9886	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis time of life gained;" Nature therefore compells him to the fact.

  9888	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhen a man is destitute of food, or other thing necessary for his life,
  9889	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand cannot preserve himselfe any other way, but by some fact against
  9890	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Law; as if in a great famine he take the food by force, or stealth,
  9891	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich he cannot obtaine for mony nor charity; or in defence of his life,
  9892	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsnatch away another mans Sword, he is totally Excused, for the reason

  9899	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9900	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAgain, Facts done against the Law, by the authority of another, are
  9901	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby that authority Excused against the Author; because no man ought to
  9902	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\taccuse his own fact in another, that is but his instrument: but it
  9903	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis not Excused against a third person thereby injured; because in the
  9904	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tviolation of the law, bothe the Author, and Actor are Criminalls.
  9905	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFrom hence it followeth that when that Man, or Assembly, that hath the
  9906	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign Power, commandeth a man to do that which is contrary to a
  9907	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tformer Law, the doing of it is totally Excused: For he ought not to
  9908	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcondemn it himselfe, because he is the Author; and what cannot justly
  9909	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe condemned by the Soveraign, cannot justly be punished by any other.
  9910	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBesides, when the Soveraign commandeth any thing to be done against
  9911	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this own former Law, the Command, as to that particular fact, is an
  9912	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tabrogation of the Law.
  9913	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9914	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIf that Man, or Assembly, that hath the Soveraign Power, disclaime
  9915	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tany Right essentiall to the Soveraignty, whereby there accrueth to the
  9916	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSubject, any liberty inconsistent with the Soveraign Power, that is to
  9917	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsay, with the very being of a Common-wealth, if the Subject shall refuse
  9918	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto obey the Command in any thing, contrary to the liberty granted, this
  9919	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis neverthelesse a Sinne, and contrary to the duty of the Subject: for
  9920	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the ought to take notice of what is inconsistent with the Soveraignty,
  9921	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbecause it was erected by his own consent, and for his own defence;
  9922	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand that such liberty as is inconsistent with it, was granted through
  9923	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tignorance of the evill consequence thereof. But if he not onely disobey,
  9924	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut also resist a publique Minister in the execution of it, then it is
  9925	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Crime; because he might have been righted, (without any breach of the
  9926	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPeace,) upon complaint.
  9927	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9928	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Degrees of Crime are taken on divers Scales, and measured, First, by
  9929	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe malignity of the Source, or Cause: Secondly, by the contagion of the
  9930	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tExample: Thirdly, by the mischiefe of the Effect; and Fourthly, by the

  9937	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9938	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe same Fact done against the Law, if it proceed from Presumption of
  9939	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tstrength, riches, or friends to resist those that are to execute the
  9940	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaw, is a greater Crime, than if it proceed from hope of not being
  9941	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdiscovered, or of escape by flight: For Presumption of impunity by
  9942	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tforce, is a Root, from whence springeth, at all times, and upon all
  9943	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttemptations, a contempt of all Lawes; whereas in the later case, the
  9944	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tapprehension of danger, that makes a man fly, renders him more obedient
  9945	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor the future. A Crime which we know to be so, is greater than the same
  9946	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCrime proceeding from a false perswasion that it is lawfull: For he that
  9947	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommitteth it against his own conscience, presumeth on his force, or
  9948	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother power, which encourages him to commit the same again: but he that
  9949	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdoth it by errour, after the errour shewn him, is conformable to the

  9959	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhose errour proceedeth from a peremptory pursute of his own principles,
  9960	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand reasoning: For what is taught by one that teacheth by publique
  9961	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAuthority, the Common-wealth teacheth, and hath a resemblance of Law,
  9962	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttill the same Authority controuleth it; and in all Crimes that contain
  9963	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot in them a denyall of the Soveraign Power, nor are against an evident
  9964	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaw, Excuseth totally: whereas he that groundeth his actions, on his

  9977	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta hope, and presumption of mercy, as encourageth him to offend, hath his

  9986	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tA Crime arising from a sudden Passion, is not so great, as when the same
  9987	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tariseth from long meditation: For in the former case there is a place
  9988	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor Extenuation, in the common infirmity of humane nature: but he that
  9989	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdoth it with praemeditation, has used circumspection, and cast his eye,
  9990	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ton the Law, on the punishment, and on the consequence thereof to humane
  9991	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsociety; all which in committing the Crime, hee hath contemned, and
  9992	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpostposed to his own appetite. But there is no suddennesse of Passion
  9993	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsufficient for a totall Excuse: For all the time between the first
  9994	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tknowing of the Law, and the Commission of the Fact, shall be taken for
  9995	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta time of deliberation; because he ought by meditation of the Law, to
  9996	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trectifie the irregularity of his Passions.
  9997	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
  9998	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhere the Law is publiquely, and with assiduity, before all the people
  9999	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tread, and interpreted; a fact done against it, is a greater Crime,
 10000	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthan where men are left without such instruction, to enquire of it with
 10001	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdifficulty, uncertainty, and interruption of their Callings, and
 10002	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe informed by private men: for in this case, part of the fault is
 10003	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdischarged upon common infirmity; but in the former there is apparent
 10004	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnegligence, which is not without some contempt of the Soveraign Power.

 10009	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTacite Approbation Of The Soveraign, Extenuates
 10010	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10011	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThose facts which the Law expresly condemneth, but the Law-maker by
 10012	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother manifest signes of his will tacitly approveth, are lesse Crimes,
 10013	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthan the same facts, condemned both by the Law, and Lawmaker. For
 10014	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tseeing the will of the Law-maker is a Law, there appear in this case two
 10015	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontradictory Lawes; which would totally Excuse, if men were bound to
 10016	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttake notice of the Soveraigns approbation, by other arguments, than are
 10017	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texpressed by his command. But because there are punishments consequent,
 10018	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot onely to the transgression of his Law, but also to the observing
 10019	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof it, he is in part a cause of the transgression, and therefore cannot
 10020	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treasonably impute the whole Crime to the Delinquent. For example, the
 10021	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaw condemneth Duells; the punishment is made capitall: On the contrary
 10022	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpart, he that refuseth Duell, is subject to contempt and scorne, without
 10023	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tremedy; and sometimes by the Soveraign himselfe thought unworthy to
 10024	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave any charge, or preferment in Warre: If thereupon he accept Duell,
 10025	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsidering all men lawfully endeavour to obtain the good opinion
 10026	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof them that have the Soveraign Power, he ought not in reason to be
 10027	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trigorously punished; seeing part of the fault may be discharged on the
 10028	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpunisher; which I say, not as wishing liberty of private revenges,
 10029	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor any other kind of disobedience; but a care in Governours, not
 10030	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto countenance any thing obliquely, which directly they forbid. The
 10031	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texamples of Princes, to those that see them, are, and ever have been,
 10032	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmore potent to govern their actions, than the Lawes themselves. And
 10033	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthough it be our duty to do, not what they do, but what they say; yet
 10034	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twill that duty never be performed, till it please God to give men an
 10035	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\textraordinary, and supernaturall grace to follow that Precept.

 10040	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tComparison Of Crimes From Their Effects
 10041	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10042	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAgain, if we compare Crimes by the mischiefe of their Effects, First,
 10043	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe same fact, when it redounds to the dammage of many, is greater, than
 10044	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhen it redounds to the hurt of few. And therefore, when a fact hurteth,
 10045	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot onely in the present, but also, (by example) in the future, it is a
 10046	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgreater Crime, than if it hurt onely in the present: for the former,
 10047	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis a fertile Crime, and multiplyes to the hurt of many; the later is
 10048	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbarren. To maintain doctrines contrary to the Religion established in
 10049	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Common-wealth, is a greater fault, in an authorised Preacher, than
 10050	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin a private person: So also is it, to live prophanely, incontinently,
 10051	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor do any irreligious act whatsoever. Likewise in a Professor of the
 10052	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaw, to maintain any point, on do any act, that tendeth to the weakning
 10053	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Soveraign Power, as a greater Crime, than in another man: Also in
 10054	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta man that hath such reputation for wisedome, as that his counsells are
 10055	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfollowed, or his actions imitated by many, his fact against the Law, is
 10056	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta greater Crime, than the same fact in another: For such men not onely
 10057	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommit Crime, but teach it for Law to all other men. And generally all
 10058	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCrimes are the greater, by the scandall they give; that is to say, by
 10059	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbecoming stumbling-blocks to the weak, that look not so much upon the
 10060	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tway they go in, as upon the light that other men carry before them.

 10129	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd by clandestine Surreption, than by consent fraudulently obtained.
 10130	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10131	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd the violation of chastity by Force, greater, than by flattery.
 10132	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10133	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd of a woman Married, than of a woman not married.
 10134	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10135	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor all these things are commonly so valued; though some men are more,
 10136	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand some lesse sensible of the same offence. But the Law regardeth not
 10137	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe particular, but the generall inclination of mankind.
 10138	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10139	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd therefore the offence men take, from contumely, in words, or
 10140	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgesture, when they produce no other harme, than the present griefe of
 10141	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim that is reproached, hath been neglected in the Lawes of the Greeks,
 10142	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRomans, and other both antient, and moderne Common-wealths; supposing
 10143	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe true cause of such griefe to consist, not in the contumely, (which
 10144	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttakes no hold upon men conscious of their own Vertue,) but in the
 10145	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPusillanimity of him that is offended by it.
 10146	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10147	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAlso a Crime against a private man, is much aggravated by the person,
 10148	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttime, and place. For to kill ones Parent, is a greater Crime, than to
 10149	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tkill another: for the Parent ought to have the honour of a Soveraign,
 10150	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(though he have surrendred his Power to the Civill Law,) because he had
 10151	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit originally by Nature. And to Robbe a poore man, is a greater Crime,
 10152	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthan to robbe a rich man; because 'tis to the poore a more sensible
 10153	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdammage.
 10154	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10155	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd a Crime committed in the Time, or Place appointed for Devotion, is
 10156	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgreater, than if committed at another time or place: for it proceeds
 10157	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom a greater contempt of the Law.
 10158	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10159	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMany other cases of Aggravation, and Extenuation might be added: but by
 10160	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthese I have set down, it is obvious to every man, to take the altitude
 10161	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof any other Crime proposed.

 10166	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPublique Crimes What
 10167	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10168	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLastly, because in almost all Crimes there is an Injury done, not onely
 10169	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto some Private man, but also to the Common-wealth; the same Crime, when
 10170	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe accusation is in the name of the Common-wealth, is called Publique
 10171	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCrime; and when in the name of a Private man, a Private Crime; And the
 10172	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPleas according thereunto called Publique, Judicia Publica, Pleas of the
 10173	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCrown; or Private Pleas. As in an Accusation of Murder, if the accuser
 10174	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe a Private man, the plea is a Private plea; if the accuser be the
 10175	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign, the plea is a Publique plea.

 10184	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Definition Of Punishment
 10185	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10186	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"A PUNISHMENT, is an Evill inflicted by publique Authority, on him that
 10187	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thath done, or omitted that which is Judged by the same Authority to be
 10188	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Transgression of the Law; to the end that the will of men may thereby
 10189	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe better be disposed to obedience."
 10190	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10191	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10192	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10193	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10194	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRight To Punish Whence Derived
 10195	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10196	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBefore I inferre any thing from this definition, there is a question to
 10197	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe answered, of much importance; which is, by what door the Right, or
 10198	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAuthority of Punishing in any case, came in. For by that which has
 10199	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeen said before, no man is supposed bound by Covenant, not to resist
 10200	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tviolence; and consequently it cannot be intended, that he gave any right
 10201	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto another to lay violent hands upon his person. In the making of a
 10202	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth, every man giveth away the right of defending another; but
 10203	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot of defending himselfe. Also he obligeth himselfe, to assist him that
 10204	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thath the Soveraignty, in the Punishing of another; but of himselfe
 10205	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot. But to covenant to assist the Soveraign, in doing hurt to another,
 10206	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunlesse he that so covenanteth have a right to doe it himselfe, is not
 10207	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto give him a Right to Punish. It is manifest therefore that the Right
 10208	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich the Common-wealth (that is, he, or they that represent it) hath to
 10209	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPunish, is not grounded on any concession, or gift of the Subjects.
 10210	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut I have also shewed formerly, that before the Institution of
 10211	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth, every man had a right to every thing, and to do
 10212	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhatsoever he thought necessary to his own preservation; subduing,
 10213	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thurting, or killing any man in order thereunto. And this is the
 10214	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfoundation of that right of Punishing, which is exercised in every
 10215	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth. For the Subjects did not give the Soveraign that right;
 10216	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut onely in laying down theirs, strengthned him to use his own, as he
 10217	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshould think fit, for the preservation of them all: so that it was not
 10218	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgiven, but left to him, and to him onely; and (excepting the limits set
 10219	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim by naturall Law) as entire, as in the condition of meer Nature, and
 10220	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof warre of every one against his neighbour.
 10221	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10222	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10223	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10224	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10225	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPrivate Injuries, And Revenges No Punishments
 10226	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10227	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFrom the definition of Punishment, I inferre, First, that neither
 10228	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprivate revenges, nor injuries of private men, can properly be stiled
 10229	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPunishment; because they proceed not from publique Authority.
 10230	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10231	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10232	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10233	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10234	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNor Denyall Of Preferment
 10235	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10236	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSecondly, that to be neglected, and unpreferred by the publique
 10237	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfavour, is not a Punishment; because no new evill is thereby on any man
 10238	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInflicted; he is onely left in the estate he was in before.
 10239	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10240	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10241	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10242	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10243	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNor Pain Inflicted Without Publique Hearing
 10244	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10245	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThirdly, that the evill inflicted by publique Authority, without
 10246	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprecedent publique condemnation, is not to be stiled by the name of
 10247	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPunishment; but of an hostile act; because the fact for which a man
 10248	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis Punished, ought first to be Judged by publique Authority, to be a
 10249	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttransgression of the Law.
 10250	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10251	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10252	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10253	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10254	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNor Pain Inflicted By Usurped Power
 10255	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10256	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFourthly, that the evill inflicted by usurped power, and Judges
 10257	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twithout Authority from the Soveraign, is not Punishment; but an act of
 10258	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thostility; because the acts of power usurped, have not for Author, the
 10259	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tperson condemned; and therefore are not acts of publique Authority.
 10260	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10261	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10262	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10263	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10264	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNor Pain Inflicted Without Respect To The Future Good
 10265	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10266	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFifthly, that all evill which is inflicted without intention, or
 10267	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpossibility of disposing the Delinquent, or (by his example) other men,
 10268	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto obey the Lawes, is not Punishment; but an act of hostility; because
 10269	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twithout such an end, no hurt done is contained under that name.
 10270	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10271	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10272	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10273	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10274	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNaturall Evill Consequences, No Punishments
 10275	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10276	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSixthly, whereas to certain actions, there be annexed by Nature, divers
 10277	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thurtfull consequences; as when a man in assaulting another, is himselfe
 10278	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tslain, or wounded; or when he falleth into sicknesse by the doing of
 10279	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsome unlawfull act; such hurt, though in respect of God, who is the
 10280	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tauthor of Nature, it may be said to be inflicted, and therefore a
 10281	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPunishment divine; yet it is not contaned in the name of Punishment in
 10282	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trespect of men, because it is not inflicted by the Authority of man.
 10283	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10284	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10285	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10286	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10287	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHurt Inflicted, If Lesse Than The Benefit Of Transgressing,
 10288	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10289	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIs Not Punishment
 10290	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10291	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSeventhly, If the harm inflicted be lesse than the benefit, or
 10292	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontentment that naturally followeth the crime committed, that harm is
 10293	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot within the definition; and is rather the Price, or Redemption, than
 10294	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Punishment of a Crime: Because it is of the nature of Punishment, to
 10295	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave for end, the disposing of men to obey the Law; which end (if it
 10296	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe lesse that the benefit of the transgression) it attaineth not, but
 10297	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tworketh a contrary effect.
 10298	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10299	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10300	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10301	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10302	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhere The Punishment Is Annexed To The Law, A Greater Hurt Is Not
 10303	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10304	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPunishment, But Hostility
 10305	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10306	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEighthly, If a Punishment be determined and prescribed in the Law it
 10307	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tselfe, and after the crime committed, there be a greater Punishment
 10308	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinflicted, the excesse is not Punishment, but an act of hostility. For
 10309	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tseeing the aym of Punishment is not a revenge, but terrour; and the
 10310	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tterrour of a great Punishment unknown, is taken away by the declaration
 10311	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof a lesse, the unexpected addition is no part of the Punishment.
 10312	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut where there is no Punishment at all determined by the Law, there
 10313	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhatsoever is inflicted, hath the nature of Punishment. For he that
 10314	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgoes about the violation of a Law, wherein no penalty is determined,
 10315	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texpecteth an indeterminate, that is to say, an arbitrary Punishment.
 10316	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10317	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10318	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10319	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10320	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHurt Inflicted For A Fact Done Before The Law, No Punishment
 10321	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10322	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNinthly, Harme inflicted for a Fact done before there was a Law that
 10323	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tforbad it, is not Punishment, but an act of Hostility: For before the
 10324	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaw, there is no transgression of the Law: But Punishment supposeth a
 10325	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfact judged, to have been a transgression of the Law; Therefore
 10326	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHarme inflicted before the Law made, is not Punishment, but an act of
 10327	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHostility.
 10328	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10329	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10330	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10331	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10332	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Representative Of The Common-wealth Unpunishable
 10333	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10334	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTenthly, Hurt inflicted on the Representative of the Common-wealth, is
 10335	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot Punishment, but an act of Hostility: Because it is of the nature
 10336	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Punishment, to be inflicted by publique Authority, which is the
 10337	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAuthority only of the Representative it self.
 10338	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10339	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10340	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10341	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10342	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHurt To Revolted Subjects Is Done By Right Of War, Not
 10343	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10344	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBy Way Of Punishment
 10345	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10346	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLastly, Harme inflicted upon one that is a declared enemy, fals not
 10347	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunder the name of Punishment: Because seeing they were either never
 10348	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsubject to the Law, and therefore cannot transgresse it; or having been
 10349	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsubject to it, and professing to be no longer so, by consequence deny
 10350	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey can transgresse it, all the Harmes that can be done them, must be
 10351	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttaken as acts of Hostility. But in declared Hostility, all infliction of
 10352	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevill is lawfull. From whence it followeth, that if a subject shall
 10353	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby fact, or word, wittingly, and deliberatly deny the authority of
 10354	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Representative of the Common-wealth, (whatsoever penalty hath
 10355	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeen formerly ordained for Treason,) he may lawfully be made to suffer
 10356	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhatsoever the Representative will: For in denying subjection, he denyes
 10357	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch Punishment as by the Law hath been ordained; and therefore suffers
 10358	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas an enemy of the Common-wealth; that is, according to the will of
 10359	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Representative. For the Punishments set down in the Law, are to
 10360	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSubjects, not to Enemies; such as are they, that having been by their
 10361	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\town act Subjects, deliberately revolting, deny the Soveraign Power.
 10362	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10363	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe first, and most generall distribution of Punishments, is into
 10364	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDivine, and Humane. Of the former I shall have occasion, to speak, in a
 10365	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmore convenient place hereafter.
 10366	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10367	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHumane, are those Punishments that be inflicted by the Commandement
 10368	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Man; and are either Corporall, or Pecuniary, or Ignominy, or
 10369	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tImprisonment, or Exile, or mixt of these.
 10370	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10371	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10372	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10373	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10374	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPunishments Corporall
 10375	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10376	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCorporall Punishment is that, which is inflicted on the body directly,
 10377	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand according to the intention of him that inflicteth it: such as are
 10378	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tstripes, or wounds, or deprivation of such pleasures of the body, as
 10379	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere before lawfully enjoyed.
 10380	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10381	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10382	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10383	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10384	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCapitall
 10385	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10386	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd of these, some be Capitall, some Lesse than Capitall. Capitall, is
 10387	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Infliction of Death; and that either simply, or with torment. Lesse
 10388	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthan Capitall, are Stripes, Wounds, Chains, and any other corporall
 10389	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPaine, not in its own nature mortall. For if upon the Infliction of
 10390	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Punishment death follow not in the Intention of the Inflicter, the
 10391	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPunishment is not be bee esteemed Capitall, though the harme prove
 10392	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmortall by an accident not to be foreseen; in which case death is not
 10393	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinflicted, but hastened.
 10394	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10395	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPecuniary Punishment, is that which consisteth not only in the
 10396	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdeprivation of a Summe of Mony, but also of Lands, or any other goods
 10397	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich are usually bought and sold for mony. And in case the Law, that
 10398	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tordaineth such a punishment, be made with design to gather mony, from
 10399	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch as shall transgresse the same, it is not properly a Punishment,
 10400	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut the Price of priviledge, and exemption from the Law, which doth not
 10401	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tabsolutely forbid the fact, but only to those that are not able to pay
 10402	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe mony: except where the Law is Naturall, or part of Religion; for in
 10403	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat case it is not an exemption from the Law, but a transgression of
 10404	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit. As where a Law exacteth a Pecuniary mulct, of them that take the
 10405	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tname of God in vaine, the payment of the mulct, is not the price of a
 10406	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdispensation to sweare, but the Punishment of the transgression of a Law
 10407	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tundispensable. In like manner if the Law impose a Summe of Mony to be
 10408	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpayd, to him that has been Injured; this is but a satisfaction for the
 10409	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thurt done him; and extinguisheth the accusation of the party injured,

 10416	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10417	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIgnominy, is the infliction of such Evill, as is made Dishonorable;
 10418	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor the deprivation of such Good, as is made Honourable by the
 10419	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth. For there be some things Honorable by Nature; as the
 10420	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teffects of Courage, Magnanimity, Strength, Wisdome, and other abilities
 10421	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof body and mind: Others made Honorable by the Common-wealth; as Badges,
 10422	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTitles, Offices, or any other singular marke of the Soveraigns favour.
 10423	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe former, (though they may faile by nature, or accident,) cannot be
 10424	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttaken away by a Law; and therefore the losse of them is not Punishment.
 10425	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut the later, may be taken away by the publique authority that made
 10426	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem Honorable, and are properly Punishments: Such are degrading men
 10427	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcondemned, of their Badges, Titles, and Offices; or declaring them
 10428	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tuncapable of the like in time to come.

 10432	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10433	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tImprisonment
 10434	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10435	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tImprisonment, is when a man is by publique Authority deprived of
 10436	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tliberty; and may happen from two divers ends; whereof one is the safe
 10437	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcustody of a man accused; the other is the inflicting of paine on a man
 10438	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcondemned. The former is not Punishment; because no man is supposed
 10439	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto be Punisht, before he be Judicially heard, and declared guilty.
 10440	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd therefore whatsoever hurt a man is made to suffer by bonds, or
 10441	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trestraint, before his cause be heard, over and above that which is
 10442	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnecessary to assure his custody, is against the Law of Nature. But the
 10443	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLater is Punishment, because Evill, and inflicted by publique Authority,
 10444	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor somewhat that has by the same Authority been Judged a Transgression
 10445	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Law. Under this word Imprisonment, I comprehend all restraint of
 10446	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmotion, caused by an externall obstacle, be it a House, which is called
 10447	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby the generall name of a Prison; or an Iland, as when men are said to
 10448	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe confined to it; or a place where men are set to worke, as in old time
 10449	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen have been condemned to Quarries, and in these times to Gallies; or
 10450	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe it a Chaine, or any other such impediment.

 10455	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tExile
 10456	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10457	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tExile, (Banishment) is when a man is for a crime, condemned to depart
 10458	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tout of the dominion of the Common-wealth, or out of a certaine part
 10459	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthereof; and during a prefixed time, or for ever, not to return into it:
 10460	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand seemeth not in its own nature, without other circumstances, to be
 10461	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Punishment; but rather an escape, or a publique commandement to
 10462	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tavoid Punishment by flight. And Cicero sayes, there was never any such
 10463	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPunishment ordained in the City of Rome; but cals it a refuge of men in
 10464	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdanger. For if a man banished, be neverthelesse permitted to enjoy
 10465	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this Goods, and the Revenue of his Lands, the meer change of ayr is no
 10466	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpunishment; nor does it tend to that benefit of the Common-wealth, for
 10467	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich all Punishments are ordained, (that is to say, to the forming of
 10468	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmens wils to the observation of the Law;) but many times to the dammage
 10469	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Common-wealth. For a Banished man, is a lawfull enemy of the
 10470	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth that banished him; as being no more a Member of the
 10471	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsame. But if he be withall deprived of his Lands, or Goods, then
 10472	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Punishment lyeth not in the Exile, but is to be reckoned amongst
 10473	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPunishments Pecuniary.

 10477	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10478	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Punishment Of Innocent Subjects Is Contrary To The Law Of Nature
 10479	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10480	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAll Punishments of Innocent subjects, be they great or little, are
 10481	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagainst the Law of Nature; For Punishment is only of Transgression of
 10482	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Law, and therefore there can be no Punishment of the Innocent. It
 10483	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis therefore a violation, First, of that Law of Nature, which forbiddeth
 10484	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall men, in their Revenges, to look at any thing but some future good:
 10485	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor there can arrive no good to the Common-wealth, by Punishing the
 10486	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInnocent. Secondly, of that, which forbiddeth Ingratitude: For seeing
 10487	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall Soveraign Power, is originally given by the consent of every one of
 10488	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Subjects, to the end they should as long as they are obedient, be
 10489	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprotected thereby; the Punishment of the Innocent, is a rendring of
 10490	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEvill for Good. And thirdly, of the Law that commandeth Equity; that
 10491	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis to say, an equall distribution of Justice; which in Punishing the
 10492	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInnocent is not observed.
 10493	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10494	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t

 10497	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut The Harme Done To Innocents In War, Not So
 10498	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10499	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut the Infliction of what evill soever, on an Innocent man, that is not
 10500	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Subject, if it be for the benefit of the Common-wealth, and without
 10501	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tviolation of any former Covenant, is no breach of the Law of Nature.
 10502	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor all men that are not Subjects, are either Enemies, or else they have
 10503	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tceased from being so, by some precedent covenants. But against Enemies,
 10504	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhom the Common-wealth judgeth capable to do them hurt, it is lawfull by
 10505	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe originall Right of Nature to make warre; wherein the Sword Judgeth
 10506	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot, nor doth the Victor make distinction of Nocent and Innocent, as to
 10507	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe time past; nor has other respect of mercy, than as it conduceth to
 10508	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe good of his own People. And upon this ground it is, that also
 10509	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin Subjects, who deliberatly deny the Authority of the Common-wealth
 10510	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\testablished, the vengeance is lawfully extended, not onely to the
 10511	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFathers, but also to the third and fourth generation not yet in being,
 10512	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand consequently innocent of the fact, for which they are afflicted:
 10513	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbecause the nature of this offence, consisteth in the renouncing of
 10514	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsubjection; which is a relapse into the condition of warre, commonly
 10515	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcalled Rebellion; and they that so offend, suffer not as Subjects, but
 10516	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas Enemies. For Rebellion, is but warre renewed.

 10522	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10523	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tREWARD, is either of Gift, or by Contract. When by Contract, it is
 10524	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcalled Salary, and Wages; which is benefit due for service performed, or
 10525	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpromised. When of Gift, it is benefit proceeding from the Grace of them
 10526	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat bestow it, to encourage, or enable men to do them service. And
 10527	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore when the Soveraign of a Common-wealth appointeth a Salary
 10528	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto any publique Office, he that receiveth it, is bound in Justice
 10529	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto performe his office; otherwise, he is bound onely in honour, to
 10530	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tacknowledgement, and an endeavour of requitall. For though men have no
 10531	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlawfull remedy, when they be commanded to quit their private businesse,
 10532	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto serve the publique, without Reward, or Salary; yet they are not
 10533	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbound thereto, by the Law of Nature, nor by the institution of the
 10534	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth, unlesse the service cannot otherwise be done; because it
 10535	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis supposed the Soveraign may make use of all their means, insomuch as
 10536	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe most common Souldier, may demand the wages of his warrefare, as a
 10537	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdebt.

 10544	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe benefits which a Soveraign bestoweth on a Subject, for fear of some
 10545	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpower, and ability he hath to do hurt to the Common-wealth, are not
 10546	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tproperly Rewards; for they are not Salaryes; because there is in this
 10547	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcase no contract supposed, every man being obliged already not to do the
 10548	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth disservice: nor are they Graces; because they be extorted
 10549	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby feare, which ought not to be incident to the Soveraign Power: but
 10550	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare rather Sacrifices, which the Soveraign (considered in his naturall
 10551	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tperson, and not in the person of the Common-wealth) makes, for the
 10552	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tappeasing the discontent of him he thinks more potent than himselfe; and
 10553	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tencourage not to obedience, but on the contrary, to the continuance, and
 10554	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tincreasing of further extortion.

 10560	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10561	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd whereas some Salaries are certain, and proceed from the publique
 10562	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTreasure; and others uncertain, and casuall, proceeding from the
 10563	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texecution of the Office for which the Salary is ordained; the later
 10564	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis in some cases hurtfull to the Common-wealth; as in the case of
 10565	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJudicature. For where the benefit of the Judges, and Ministers of a
 10566	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCourt of Justice, ariseth for the multitude of Causes that are brought
 10567	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto their cognisance, there must needs follow two Inconveniences: One,
 10568	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis the nourishing of sutes; for the more sutes, the greater benefit: and
 10569	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tanother that depends on that, which is contention about Jurisdiction;
 10570	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teach Court drawing to it selfe, as many Causes as it can. But in
 10571	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\toffices of Execution there are not those Inconveniences; because their
 10572	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\temployment cannot be encreased by any endeavour of their own. And thus
 10573	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmuch shall suffice for the nature of Punishment, and Reward; which are,
 10574	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas it were, the Nerves and Tendons, that move the limbes and joynts of a
 10575	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth.
 10576	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10577	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHitherto I have set forth the nature of Man, (whose Pride and other
 10578	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPassions have compelled him to submit himselfe to Government;) together
 10579	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith the great power of his Governour, whom I compared to Leviathan,
 10580	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttaking that comparison out of the two last verses of the one and
 10581	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfortieth of Job; where God having set forth the great power of
 10582	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLeviathan, called him King of the Proud. "There is nothing," saith he,
 10583	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"on earth, to be compared with him. He is made so as not be afraid. Hee
 10584	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tseeth every high thing below him; and is King of all the children of
 10585	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpride." But because he is mortall, and subject to decay, as all other
 10586	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEarthly creatures are; and because there is that in heaven, (though not
 10587	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ton earth) that he should stand in fear of, and whose Lawes he ought to
 10588	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobey; I shall in the next following Chapters speak of his Diseases, and
 10589	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe causes of his Mortality; and of what Lawes of Nature he is bound to

 10598	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDissolution Of Common-wealths Proceedeth From Imperfect Institution
 10599	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10600	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThough nothing can be immortall, which mortals make; yet, if men had the
 10601	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tuse of reason they pretend to, their Common-wealths might be secured, at
 10602	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tleast, from perishing by internall diseases. For by the nature of their
 10603	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInstitution, they are designed to live, as long as Man-kind, or as
 10604	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Lawes of Nature, or as Justice it selfe, which gives them life.
 10605	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTherefore when they come to be dissolved, not by externall violence, but
 10606	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tintestine disorder, the fault is not in men, as they are the Matter; but
 10607	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas they are the Makers, and orderers of them. For men, as they become
 10608	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tat last weary of irregular justling, and hewing one another, and desire
 10609	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith all their hearts, to conforme themselves into one firme and lasting
 10610	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tedifice; so for want, both of the art of making fit Laws, to square
 10611	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir actions by, and also of humility, and patience, to suffer the rude
 10612	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand combersome points of their present greatnesse to be taken off, they
 10613	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcannot without the help of a very able Architect, be compiled, into any
 10614	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother than a crasie building, such as hardly lasting out their own time,
 10615	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmust assuredly fall upon the heads of their posterity.
 10616	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10617	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAmongst the Infirmities therefore of a Common-wealth, I will reckon in
 10618	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe first place, those that arise from an Imperfect Institution,
 10619	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand resemble the diseases of a naturall body, which proceed from a
 10620	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDefectuous Procreation.

 10625	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWant Of Absolute Power
 10626	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10627	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf which, this is one, "That a man to obtain a Kingdome, is sometimes
 10628	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontent with lesse Power, than to the Peace, and defence of the
 10629	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth is necessarily required." From whence it commeth to passe,
 10630	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat when the exercise of the Power layd by, is for the publique safety
 10631	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto be resumed, it hath the resemblance of as unjust act; which disposeth
 10632	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgreat numbers of men (when occasion is presented) to rebell; In the
 10633	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsame manner as the bodies of children, gotten by diseased parents, are
 10634	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsubject either to untimely death, or to purge the ill quality, derived
 10635	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom their vicious conception, by breaking out into biles and scabbs.
 10636	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd when Kings deny themselves some such necessary Power, it is not
 10637	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talwayes (though sometimes) out of ignorance of what is necessary to the
 10638	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\toffice they undertake; but many times out of a hope to recover the same
 10639	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagain at their pleasure: Wherein they reason not well; because such as
 10640	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twill hold them to their promises, shall be maintained against them by
 10641	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tforraign Common-wealths; who in order to the good of their own Subjects
 10642	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlet slip few occasions to Weaken the estate of their Neighbours. So was
 10643	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThomas Beckett Archbishop of Canterbury, supported against Henry
 10644	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Second, by the Pope; the subjection of Ecclesiastiques to the
 10645	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth, having been dispensed with by William the Conqueror at
 10646	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this reception, when he took an Oath, not to infringe the liberty of the
 10647	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChurch. And so were the Barons, whose power was by William Rufus (to
 10648	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave their help in transferring the Succession from his Elder brother,
 10649	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto himselfe,) encreased to a degree, inconsistent with the Soveraign
 10650	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPower, maintained in their Rebellion against King John, by the French.
 10651	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNor does this happen in Monarchy onely. For whereas the stile of the
 10652	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tantient Roman Common-wealth, was, The Senate, and People of Rome;
 10653	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tneither Senate, nor People pretended to the whole Power; which first
 10654	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcaused the seditions, of Tiberius Gracchus, Caius Gracchus, Lucius
 10655	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSaturnius, and others; and afterwards the warres between the Senate and
 10656	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe People, under Marius and Sylla; and again under Pompey and Caesar,
 10657	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto the Extinction of their Democraty, and the setting up of Monarchy.
 10658	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10659	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe people of Athens bound themselves but from one onely Action; which
 10660	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas, that no man on pain of death should propound the renewing of the
 10661	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twarre for the Island of Salamis; And yet thereby, if Solon had not
 10662	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcaused to be given out he was mad, and afterwards in gesture and habit

 10664	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tabout him, they had had an enemy perpetually in readinesse, even at the
 10665	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgates of their Citie; such dammage, or shifts, are all Common-wealths
 10666	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tforced to, that have their Power never so little limited.

 10671	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPrivate Judgement Of Good and Evill
 10672	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10673	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn the second place, I observe the Diseases of a Common-wealth, that
 10674	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tproceed from the poyson of seditious doctrines; whereof one is, "That
 10675	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevery private man is Judge of Good and Evill actions." This is true in
 10676	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe condition of meer Nature, where there are no Civill Lawes; and also
 10677	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunder Civill Government, in such cases as are not determined by the
 10678	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaw. But otherwise, it is manifest, that the measure of Good and Evill
 10679	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tactions, is the Civill Law; and the Judge the Legislator, who is alwayes
 10680	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRepresentative of the Common-wealth. From this false doctrine, men are
 10681	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdisposed to debate with themselves, and dispute the commands of the
 10682	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth; and afterwards to obey, or disobey them, as in their
 10683	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprivate judgements they shall think fit. Whereby the Common-wealth is
 10684	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdistracted and Weakened.

 10689	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tErroneous Conscience
 10690	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10691	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnother doctrine repugnant to Civill Society, is, that "Whatsoever a
 10692	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman does against his Conscience, is Sinne;" and it dependeth on the
 10693	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpresumption of making himself judge of Good and Evill. For a mans
 10694	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConscience, and his Judgement is the same thing; and as the Judgement,
 10695	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tso also the Conscience may be erroneous. Therefore, though he that is
 10696	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsubject to no Civill Law, sinneth in all he does against his Conscience,
 10697	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbecause he has no other rule to follow but his own reason; yet it is
 10698	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot so with him that lives in a Common-wealth; because the Law is the
 10699	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpublique Conscience, by which he hath already undertaken to be guided.
 10700	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOtherwise in such diversity, as there is of private Consciences, which
 10701	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare but private opinions, the Common-wealth must needs be distracted,
 10702	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand no man dare to obey the Soveraign Power, farther than it shall seem
 10703	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgood in his own eyes.

 10708	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPretence Of Inspiration
 10709	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10710	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIt hath been also commonly taught, "That Faith and Sanctity, are not to
 10711	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe attained by Study and Reason, but by supernaturall Inspiration, or
 10712	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInfusion," which granted, I see not why any man should render a reason
 10713	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof his Faith; or why every Christian should not be also a Prophet; or
 10714	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhy any man should take the Law of his Country, rather than his own
 10715	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInspiration, for the rule of his action. And thus wee fall again into
 10716	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe fault of taking upon us to Judge of Good and Evill; or to make
 10717	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJudges of it, such private men as pretend to be supernaturally Inspired,
 10718	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto the Dissolution of all Civill Government. Faith comes by hearing,
 10719	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand hearing by those accidents, which guide us into the presence of them
 10720	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat speak to us; which accidents are all contrived by God Almighty; and
 10721	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tyet are not supernaturall, but onely, for the great number of them that
 10722	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconcurre to every effect, unobservable. Faith, and Sanctity, are indeed
 10723	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot very frequent; but yet they are not Miracles, but brought to passe
 10724	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby education, discipline, correction, and other naturall wayes, by which
 10725	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod worketh them in his elect, as such time as he thinketh fit. And
 10726	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthese three opinions, pernicious to Peace and Government, have in this
 10727	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpart of the world, proceeded chiefly from the tongues, and pens of
 10728	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunlearned Divines; who joyning the words of Holy Scripture together,
 10729	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\totherwise than is agreeable to reason, do what they can, to make men
 10730	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthink, that Sanctity and Naturall Reason, cannot stand together.

 10735	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSubjecting The Soveraign Power To Civill Lawes
 10736	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10737	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tA fourth opinion, repugnant to the nature of a Common-wealth, is this,
 10738	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"That he that hath the Soveraign Power, is subject to the Civill Lawes."
 10739	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIt is true, that Soveraigns are all subjects to the Lawes of Nature;
 10740	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbecause such lawes be Divine, and cannot by any man, or Common-wealth
 10741	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe abrogated. But to those Lawes which the Soveraign himselfe, that is,
 10742	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich the Common-wealth maketh, he is not subject. For to be subject to
 10743	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLawes, is to be subject to the Common-wealth, that is to the Soveraign
 10744	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRepresentative, that is to himselfe; which is not subjection, but
 10745	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfreedome from the Lawes. Which errour, because it setteth the Lawes
 10746	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tabove the Soveraign, setteth also a Judge above him, and a Power to
 10747	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpunish him; which is to make a new Soveraign; and again for the same
 10748	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treason a third, to punish the second; and so continually without end, to
 10749	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Confusion, and Dissolution of the Common-wealth.

 10754	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAttributing Of Absolute Propriety To The Subjects
 10755	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10756	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tA Fifth doctrine, that tendeth to the Dissolution of a Common-wealth,
 10757	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis, "That every private man has an absolute Propriety in his Goods;
 10758	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch, as excludeth the Right of the Soveraign." Every man has indeed a
 10759	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPropriety that excludes the Right of every other Subject: And he has it
 10760	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tonely from the Soveraign Power; without the protection whereof, every
 10761	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother man should have equall Right to the same. But if the Right of the
 10762	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign also be excluded, he cannot performe the office they have put
 10763	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim into; which is, to defend them both from forraign enemies, and
 10764	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom the injuries of one another; and consequently there is no longer a
 10765	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth.
 10766	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10767	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd if the Propriety of Subjects, exclude not the Right of the
 10768	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign Representative to their Goods; much lesse to their offices
 10769	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Judicature, or Execution, in which they Represent the Soveraign
 10770	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thimselfe.

 10775	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDividing Of The Soveraign Power
 10776	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10777	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThere is a Sixth doctrine, plainly, and directly against the essence
 10778	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof a Common-wealth; and 'tis this, "That the Soveraign Power may be
 10779	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdivided." For what is it to divide the Power of a Common-wealth, but
 10780	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto Dissolve it; for Powers divided mutually destroy each other. And for
 10781	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthese doctrines, men are chiefly beholding to some of those, that making
 10782	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprofession of the Lawes, endeavour to make them depend upon their own
 10783	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlearning, and not upon the Legislative Power.

 10788	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tImitation Of Neighbour Nations
 10789	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10790	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd as False Doctrine, so also often-times the Example of different
 10791	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGovernment in a neighbouring Nation, disposeth men to alteration of
 10792	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe forme already setled. So the people of the Jewes were stirred up to
 10793	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treject God, and to call upon the Prophet Samuel, for a King after
 10794	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe manner of the Nations; So also the lesser Cities of Greece, were
 10795	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontinually disturbed, with seditions of the Aristocraticall, and
 10796	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDemocraticall factions; one part of almost every Common-wealth, desiring
 10797	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto imitate the Lacedaemonians; the other, the Athenians. And I doubt
 10798	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot, but many men, have been contented to see the late troubles in
 10799	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEngland, out of an imitation of the Low Countries; supposing there
 10800	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tneeded no more to grow rich, than to change, as they had done, the forme
 10801	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof their Government. For the constitution of mans nature, is of it selfe
 10802	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsubject to desire novelty: When therefore they are provoked to the same,
 10803	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby the neighbourhood also of those that have been enriched by it, it is
 10804	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talmost impossible for them, not to be content with those that solicite
 10805	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem to change; and love the first beginnings, though they be grieved
 10806	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith the continuance of disorder; like hot blouds, that having gotten
 10807	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe itch, tear themselves with their own nayles, till they can endure

 10814	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10815	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd as to Rebellion in particular against Monarchy; one of the most
 10816	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrequent causes of it, is the Reading of the books of Policy, and
 10817	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHistories of the antient Greeks, and Romans; from which, young men,
 10818	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand all others that are unprovided of the Antidote of solid Reason,
 10819	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treceiving a strong, and delightfull impression, of the great exploits
 10820	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof warre, atchieved by the Conductors of their Armies, receive withall
 10821	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta pleasing Idea, of all they have done besides; and imagine their great
 10822	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprosperity, not to have proceeded from the aemulation of particular men,
 10823	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut from the vertue of their popular form of government: Not considering
 10824	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe frequent Seditions, and Civill Warres, produced by the imperfection
 10825	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof their Policy. From the reading, I say, of such books, men have
 10826	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tundertaken to kill their Kings, because the Greek and Latine writers,
 10827	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin their books, and discourses of Policy, make it lawfull, and laudable,
 10828	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor any man so to do; provided before he do it, he call him Tyrant. For
 10829	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey say not Regicide, that is, killing of a King, but Tyrannicide, that
 10830	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis, killing of a Tyrant is lawfull. From the same books, they that live
 10831	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunder a Monarch conceive an opinion, that the Subjects in a Popular
 10832	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth enjoy Liberty; but that in a Monarchy they are all Slaves.
 10833	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tI say, they that live under a Monarchy conceive such an opinion; not
 10834	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey that live under a Popular Government; for they find no such matter.
 10835	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn summe, I cannot imagine, how anything can be more prejudiciall to a
 10836	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMonarchy, than the allowing of such books to be publikely read, without
 10837	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpresent applying such correctives of discreet Masters, as are fit to
 10838	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttake away their Venime; Which Venime I will not doubt to compare to
 10839	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe biting of a mad Dogge, which is a disease the Physicians call
 10840	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHydrophobia, or Fear Of Water. For as he that is so bitten, has a
 10841	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontinuall torment of thirst, and yet abhorreth water; and is in such
 10842	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tan estate, as if the poyson endeavoured to convert him into a Dogge:
 10843	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSo when a Monarchy is once bitten to the quick, by those Democraticall
 10844	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twriters, that continually snarle at that estate; it wanteth nothing
 10845	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmore than a strong Monarch, which neverthelesse out of a certain
 10846	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTyrannophobia, or feare of being strongly governed, when they have him,
 10847	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey abhorre.
 10848	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10849	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAs here have been Doctors, that hold there be three Soules in a man;
 10850	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tso there be also that think there may be more Soules, (that is, more
 10851	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraigns,) than one, in a Common-wealth; and set up a Supremacy
 10852	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagainst the Soveraignty; Canons against Lawes; and a Ghostly Authority
 10853	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagainst the Civill; working on mens minds, with words and distinctions,
 10854	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat of themselves signifie nothing, but bewray (by their obscurity)
 10855	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat there walketh (as some think invisibly) another Kingdome, as it
 10856	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere a Kingdome of Fayries, in the dark. Now seeing it is manifest, that
 10857	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Civill Power, and the Power of the Common-wealth is the same
 10858	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthing; and that Supremacy, and the Power of making Canons, and granting
 10859	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFaculties, implyeth a Common-wealth; it followeth, that where one is
 10860	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign, another Supreme; where one can make Lawes, and another
 10861	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmake Canons; there must needs be two Common-wealths, of one & the same
 10862	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSubjects; which is a Kingdome divided in it selfe, and cannot stand. For
 10863	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnotwithstanding the insignificant distinction of Temporall, and Ghostly,
 10864	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey are still two Kingdomes, and every Subject is subject to two
 10865	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMasters. For seeing the Ghostly Power challengeth the Right to declare
 10866	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhat is Sinne it challengeth by consequence to declare what is Law,
 10867	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(Sinne being nothing but the transgression of the Law;) and again, the
 10868	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCivill Power challenging to declare what is Law, every Subject must
 10869	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobey two Masters, who bothe will have their Commands be observed as Law;
 10870	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich is impossible. Or, if it be but one Kingdome, either the Civill,
 10871	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich is the Power of the Common-wealth, must be subordinate to the
 10872	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGhostly; or the Ghostly must be subordinate to the Temporall and then
 10873	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere is no Supremacy but the Temporall. When therefore these two Powers
 10874	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\toppose one another, the Common-wealth cannot but be in great danger
 10875	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Civill warre, and Dissolution. For the Civill Authority being more
 10876	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tvisible, and standing in the cleerer light of naturall reason cannot
 10877	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tchoose but draw to it in all times a very considerable part of the
 10878	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpeople: And the Spirituall, though it stand in the darknesse of Schoole
 10879	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdistinctions, and hard words; yet because the fear of Darknesse, and
 10880	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGhosts, is greater than other fears, cannot want a party sufficient to
 10881	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTrouble, and sometimes to Destroy a Common-wealth. And this is a Disease
 10882	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich not unfitly may be compared to the Epilepsie, or Falling-sicknesse
 10883	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(which the Jewes took to be one kind of possession by Spirits) in the
 10884	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBody Naturall. For as in this Disease, there is an unnaturall spirit,
 10885	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor wind in the head that obstructeth the roots of the Nerves, and moving
 10886	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem violently, taketh away the motion which naturally they should have
 10887	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom the power of the Soule in the Brain, and thereby causeth violent,
 10888	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand irregular motions (which men call Convulsions) in the parts;
 10889	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinsomuch as he that is seized therewith, falleth down sometimes into the
 10890	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twater, and sometimes into the fire, as a man deprived of his senses;
 10891	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tso also in the Body Politique, when the Spirituall power, moveth the
 10892	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMembers of a Common-wealth, by the terrour of punishments, and hope of
 10893	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trewards (which are the Nerves of it,) otherwise than by the Civill Power
 10894	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(which is the Soule of the Common-wealth) they ought to be moved; and by
 10895	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tstrange, and hard words suffocates the people, and either Overwhelm
 10896	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Common-wealth with Oppression, or cast it into the Fire of a Civill

 10904	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSometimes also in the meerly Civill government, there be more than
 10905	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tone Soule: As when the Power of levying mony, (which is the Nutritive
 10906	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfaculty,) has depended on a generall Assembly; the Power of conduct and
 10907	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommand, (which is the Motive Faculty,) on one man; and the Power of
 10908	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmaking Lawes, (which is the Rationall faculty,) on the accidentall
 10909	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsent, not onely of those two, but also of a third; This endangereth
 10910	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Common-wealth, somtimes for want of consent to good Lawes; but most
 10911	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\toften for want of such Nourishment, as is necessary to Life, and Motion.
 10912	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor although few perceive, that such government, is not government,
 10913	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut division of the Common-wealth into three Factions, and call it
 10914	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmixt Monarchy; yet the truth is, that it is not one independent
 10915	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth, but three independent Factions; nor one Representative

 10917	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tindependent, without breach of unity in God that Reigneth; but where men
 10918	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tReigne, that be subject to diversity of opinions, it cannot be so. And
 10919	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore if the King bear the person of the People, and the generall
 10920	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAssembly bear also the person of the People, and another assembly bear
 10921	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe person of a Part of the people, they are not one Person, nor one

 10924	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo what Disease in the Naturall Body of man, I may exactly compare this
 10925	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tirregularity of a Common-wealth, I know not. But I have seen a man, that
 10926	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thad another man growing out of his side, with an head, armes, breast,
 10927	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand stomach, of his own: If he had had another man growing out of his

 10935	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHitherto I have named such Diseases of a Common-wealth, as are of the
 10936	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgreatest, and most present danger. There be other, not so great; which
 10937	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tneverthelesse are not unfit to be observed. As first, the difficulty of
 10938	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\traising Mony, for the necessary uses of the Common-wealth; especially
 10939	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the approach of warre. This difficulty ariseth from the opinion, that
 10940	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevery Subject hath of a Propriety in his lands and goods, exclusive of
 10941	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Soveraigns Right to the use of the same. From whence it commeth to
 10942	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpasse, that the Soveraign Power, which foreseeth the necessities and
 10943	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdangers of the Common-wealth, (finding the passage of mony to the
 10944	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpublique Treasure obstructed, by the tenacity of the people,) whereas
 10945	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit ought to extend it selfe, to encounter, and prevent such dangers in
 10946	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir beginnings, contracteth it selfe as long as it can, and when it
 10947	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcannot longer, struggles with the people by strategems of Law, to obtain
 10948	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlittle summes, which not sufficing, he is fain at last violently to
 10949	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\topen the way for present supply, or Perish; and being put often to these
 10950	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\textremities, at last reduceth the people to their due temper; or else
 10951	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Common-wealth must perish. Insomuch as we may compare this Distemper
 10952	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tvery aptly to an Ague; wherein, the fleshy parts being congealed, or
 10953	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby venomous matter obstructed; the Veins which by their naturall course
 10954	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tempty themselves into the Heart, are not (as they ought to be) supplyed
 10955	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom the Arteries, whereby there succeedeth at first a cold contraction,
 10956	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand trembling of the limbes; and afterwards a hot, and strong endeavour
 10957	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Heart, to force a passage for the Bloud; and before it can do
 10958	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat, contenteth it selfe with the small refreshments of such things as
 10959	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcoole of a time, till (if Nature be strong enough) it break at last
 10960	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe contumacy of the parts obstructed, and dissipateth the venome into

 10967	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 10968	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAgain, there is sometimes in a Common-wealth, a Disease, which
 10969	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tresembleth the Pleurisie; and that is, when the Treasure of the
 10970	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth, flowing out of its due course, is gathered together in
 10971	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttoo much abundance, in one, or a few private men, by Monopolies, or by
 10972	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFarmes of the Publique Revenues; in the same manner as the Blood in a
 10973	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPleurisie, getting into the Membrane of the breast, breedeth there an
 10974	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInflammation, accompanied with a Fever, and painfull stitches.

 10981	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAlso, the Popularity of a potent Subject, (unlesse the Common-wealth
 10982	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave very good caution of his fidelity,) is a dangerous Disease; because
 10983	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe people (which should receive their motion from the Authority of the
 10984	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign,) by the flattery, and by the reputation of an ambitious man,
 10985	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare drawn away from their obedience to the Lawes, to follow a man, of
 10986	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhose vertues, and designes they have no knowledge. And this is commonly
 10987	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof more danger in a Popular Government, than in a Monarchy; as it may
 10988	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teasily be made believe, they are the People. By this means it was, that
 10989	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJulius Caesar, who was set up by the People against the Senate, having
 10990	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twon to himselfe the affections of his Army, made himselfe Master, both
 10991	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Senate and People. And this proceeding of popular, and ambitious men,

 11013	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tperpetually medling with the Fundamentall Lawes, to the molestation
 11014	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Common-wealth; like the little Wormes, which Physicians call

 11028	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLastly, when in a warre (forraign, or intestine,) the enemies got a

 11030	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tno longer) there is no farther protection of Subjects in their loyalty;
 11031	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthen is the Common-wealth DISSOLVED, and every man at liberty to protect

 11033	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor the Soveraign, is the publique Soule, giving Life and Motion to the

 11036	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthough the Right of a Soveraign Monarch cannot be extinguished by the
 11037	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tact of another; yet the Obligation of the members may. For he that
 11038	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twants protection, may seek it anywhere; and when he hath it, is obliged
 11039	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(without fraudulent pretence of having submitted himselfe out of fear,)
 11040	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto protect his Protection as long as he is able. But when the Power of
 11041	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tan Assembly is once suppressed, the Right of the same perisheth utterly;
 11042	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbecause the Assembly it selfe is extinct; and consequently, there is no

 11057	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis obliged by the Law of Nature, and to render an account thereof to
 11058	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod, the Author of that Law, and to none but him. But by Safety here, is
 11059	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot meant a bare Preservation, but also all other Contentments of life,

 11078	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAgainst The Duty Of A Soveraign To Relinquish Any Essentiall Right
 11079	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11080	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Soveraignty Or Not To See The People Taught The Grounds Of Them
 11081	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11082	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd because, if the essentiall Rights of Soveraignty (specified before
 11083	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the eighteenth Chapter) be taken away, the Common-wealth is thereby
 11084	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdissolved, and every man returneth into the condition, and calamity of a
 11085	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twarre with every other man, (which is the greatest evill that can happen
 11086	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin this life;) it is the Office of the Soveraign, to maintain those
 11087	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRights entire; and consequently against his duty, First, to transferre
 11088	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto another, or to lay from himselfe any of them. For he that deserteth
 11089	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Means, deserteth the Ends; and he deserteth the Means, that being
 11090	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Soveraign, acknowledgeth himselfe subject to the Civill Lawes; and
 11091	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trenounceth the Power of Supreme Judicature; or of making Warre, or
 11092	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPeace by his own Authority; or of Judging of the Necessities of the
 11093	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth; or of levying Mony, and Souldiers, when, and as much as
 11094	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin his own conscience he shall judge necessary; or of making Officers,
 11095	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Ministers both of Warre, and Peace; or of appointing Teachers, and
 11096	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texamining what Doctrines are conformable, or contrary to the Defence,
 11097	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPeace, and Good of the people. Secondly, it is against his duty, to let
 11098	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe people be ignorant, or mis-in-formed of the grounds, and reasons
 11099	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof those his essentiall Rights; because thereby men are easie to be
 11100	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tseduced, and drawn to resist him, when the Common-wealth shall require
 11101	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir use and exercise.
 11102	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11103	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd the grounds of these Rights, have the rather need to be diligently,
 11104	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand truly taught; because they cannot be maintained by any Civill Law,
 11105	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor terrour of legal punishment. For a Civill Law, that shall forbid
 11106	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRebellion, (and such is all resistance to the essentiall Rights of
 11107	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraignty,) is not (as a Civill Law) any obligation, but by vertue
 11108	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tonely of the Law of Nature, that forbiddeth the violation of Faith;
 11109	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich naturall obligation if men know not, they cannot know the Right of
 11110	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tany Law the Soveraign maketh. And for the Punishment, they take it
 11111	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut for an act of Hostility; which when they think they have strength
 11112	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tenough, they will endeavour by acts of Hostility, to avoyd.

 11119	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAbsolute Soveraignty
 11120	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11121	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAs I have heard some say, that Justice is but a word, without substance;
 11122	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand that whatsoever a man can by force, or art, acquire to himselfe,
 11123	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(not onely in the condition of warre, but also in a Common-wealth,) is
 11124	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this own, which I have already shewed to be false: So there be also
 11125	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat maintain, that there are no grounds, nor Principles of Reason, to
 11126	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsustain those essentiall Rights, which make Soveraignty absolute. For
 11127	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tif there were, they would have been found out in some place, or other;
 11128	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhereas we see, there has not hitherto been any Common-wealth, where
 11129	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose Rights have been acknowledged, or challenged. Wherein they argue
 11130	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas ill, as if the Savage people of America, should deny there were any
 11131	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgrounds, or Principles of Reason, so to build a house, as to last as
 11132	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlong as the materials, because they never yet saw any so well built.
 11133	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTime, and Industry, produce every day new knowledge. And as the art
 11134	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof well building, is derived from Principles of Reason, observed by
 11135	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tindustrious men, that had long studied the nature of materials, and
 11136	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe divers effects of figure, and proportion, long after mankind
 11137	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbegan (though poorly) to build: So, long time after men have begun to
 11138	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconstitute Common-wealths, imperfect, and apt to relapse into disorder,
 11139	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere may, Principles of Reason be found out, by industrious meditation,
 11140	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto make use of them, or be neglected by them, or not, concerneth my
 11141	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tparticular interest, at this day, very little. But supposing that
 11142	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthese of mine are not such Principles of Reason; yet I am sure they are
 11143	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPrinciples from Authority of Scripture; as I shall make it appear, when
 11144	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tI shall come to speak of the Kingdome of God, (administred by Moses,)
 11145	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tover the Jewes, his peculiar people by Covenant.

 11151	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11152	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut they say again, that though the Principles be right, yet Common
 11153	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpeople are not of capacity enough to be made to understand them. I
 11154	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshould be glad, that the Rich, and Potent Subjects of a Kingdome, or
 11155	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose that are accounted the most Learned, were no lesse incapable than
 11156	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey. But all men know, that the obstructions to this kind of doctrine,
 11157	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tproceed not so much from the difficulty of the matter, as from the
 11158	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinterest of them that are to learn. Potent men, digest hardly any thing
 11159	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat setteth up a Power to bridle their affections; and Learned men,
 11160	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tany thing that discovereth their errours, and thereby lesseneth their
 11161	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAuthority: whereas the Common-peoples minds, unlesse they be tainted
 11162	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith dependance on the Potent, or scribbled over with the opinions
 11163	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof their Doctors, are like clean paper, fit to receive whatsoever by
 11164	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPublique Authority shall be imprinted in them. Shall whole Nations be
 11165	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbrought to Acquiesce in the great Mysteries of Christian Religion, which
 11166	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare above Reason; and millions of men be made believe, that the same
 11167	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBody may be in innumerable places, at one and the same time, which
 11168	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis against Reason; and shall not men be able, by their teaching, and
 11169	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpreaching, protected by the Law, to make that received, which is so
 11170	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsonant to Reason, that any unprejudicated man, needs no more to learn
 11171	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit, than to hear it? I conclude therefore, that in the instruction
 11172	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the people in the Essentiall Rights (which are the Naturall, and
 11173	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFundamentall Lawes) of Soveraignty, there is no difficulty, (whilest a
 11174	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign has his Power entire,) but what proceeds from his own fault,
 11175	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor the fault of those whom he trusteth in the administration of the
 11176	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth; and consequently, it is his Duty, to cause them so to be
 11177	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinstructed; and not onely his Duty, but his Benefit also, and Security,
 11178	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagainst the danger that may arrive to himselfe in his naturall Person,
 11179	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom Rebellion.

 11182	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11183	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11184	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSubjects Are To Be Taught, Not To Affect Change Of Government
 11185	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11186	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd (to descend to particulars) the People are to be taught, First, that
 11187	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey ought not to be in love with any forme of Government they see
 11188	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin their neighbour Nations, more than with their own, nor (whatsoever
 11189	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpresent prosperity they behold in Nations that are otherwise governed
 11190	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthan they,) to desire change. For the prosperity of a People ruled by
 11191	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tan Aristocraticall, or Democraticall assembly, commeth not from
 11192	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAristocracy, nor from Democracy, but from the Obedience, and Concord of
 11193	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Subjects; nor do the people flourish in a Monarchy, because one man
 11194	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thas the right to rule them, but because they obey him. Take away in
 11195	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tany kind of State, the Obedience, (and consequently the Concord of the
 11196	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPeople,) and they shall not onely not flourish, but in short time be
 11197	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdissolved. And they that go about by disobedience, to doe no more than
 11198	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treforme the Common-wealth, shall find they do thereby destroy it; like
 11199	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe foolish daughters of Peleus (in the fable;) which desiring to renew
 11200	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe youth of their decrepit Father, did by the Counsell of Medea, cut
 11201	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim in pieces, and boyle him, together with strange herbs, but made not
 11202	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof him a new man. This desire of change, is like the breach of the first
 11203	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Gods Commandements: For there God says, Non Habebis Deos Alienos;
 11204	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThou shalt not have the Gods of other Nations; and in another place
 11205	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconcerning Kings, that they are Gods.
 11206	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11207	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11208	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11209	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11210	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNor Adhere (Against The Soveraign) To Popular Men
 11211	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11212	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSecondly, they are to be taught, that they ought not to be led with
 11213	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tadmiration of the vertue of any of their fellow Subjects, how
 11214	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thigh soever he stand, nor how conspicuously soever he shine in the
 11215	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth; nor of any Assembly, (except the Soveraign Assembly,)
 11216	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tso as to deferre to them any obedience, or honour, appropriate to the
 11217	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign onely, whom (in their particular stations) they represent; nor
 11218	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto receive any influence from them, but such as is conveighed by them
 11219	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom the Soveraign Authority. For that Soveraign, cannot be imagined to
 11220	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlove his People as he ought, that is not Jealous of them, but suffers
 11221	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem by the flattery of Popular men, to be seduced from their loyalty,
 11222	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas they have often been, not onely secretly, but openly, so as to
 11223	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tproclaime Marriage with them In Facie Ecclesiae by Preachers; and by
 11224	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpublishing the same in the open streets: which may fitly be compared to
 11225	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe violation of the second of the ten Commandements.
 11226	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11227	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11228	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11229	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNor To Dispute The Soveraign Power
 11230	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11231	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThirdly, in consequence to this, they ought to be informed, how great
 11232	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfault it is, to speak evill of the Soveraign Representative, (whether
 11233	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOne man, or an Assembly of men;) or to argue and dispute his Power, or
 11234	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tany way to use his Name irreverently, whereby he may be brought into
 11235	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tContempt with his People, and their Obedience (in which the safety
 11236	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Common-wealth consisteth) slackened. Which doctrine the third
 11237	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommandement by resemblance pointeth to.
 11238	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11239	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11240	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11241	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11242	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd To Have Dayes Set Apart To Learn Their Duty
 11243	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11244	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFourthly, seeing people cannot be taught this, nor when 'tis taught,
 11245	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tremember it, nor after one generation past, so much as know in whom the
 11246	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign Power is placed, without setting a part from their ordinary
 11247	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlabour, some certain times, in which they may attend those that are
 11248	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tappointed to instruct them; It is necessary that some such times be
 11249	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdetermined, wherein they may assemble together, and (after prayers and
 11250	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpraises given to God, the Soveraign of Soveraigns) hear those their
 11251	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDuties told them, and the Positive Lawes, such as generally concern them
 11252	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall, read and expounded, and be put in mind of the Authority that maketh
 11253	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem Lawes. To this end had the Jewes every seventh day, a Sabbath, in
 11254	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich the Law was read and expounded; and in the solemnity whereof they
 11255	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere put in mind, that their King was God; that having created the world
 11256	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin six days, he rested the seventh day; and by their resting on it from
 11257	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir labour, that that God was their King, which redeemed them from
 11258	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir servile, and painfull labour in Egypt, and gave them a time, after
 11259	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey had rejoyced in God, to take joy also in themselves, by lawfull
 11260	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trecreation. So that the first Table of the Commandements, is spent all,
 11261	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin setting down the summe of Gods absolute Power; not onely as God,
 11262	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut as King by pact, (in peculiar) of the Jewes; and may therefore give
 11263	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlight, to those that have the Soveraign Power conferred on them by the
 11264	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsent of men, to see what doctrine they Ought to teach their Subjects.
 11265	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11266	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11267	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11268	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11269	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd To Honour Their Parents
 11270	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11271	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd because the first instruction of Children, dependeth on the care
 11272	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof their Parents; it is necessary that they should be obedient to them,
 11273	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhilest they are under their tuition; and not onely so, but that also
 11274	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tafterwards (as gratitude requireth,) they acknowledge the benefit of
 11275	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir education, by externall signes of honour. To which end they are
 11276	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto be taught, that originally the Father of every man was also his
 11277	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign Lord, with power over him of life and death; and that the
 11278	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFathers of families, when by instituting a Common-wealth, they resigned
 11279	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat absolute Power, yet it was never intended, they should lose the
 11280	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thonour due unto them for their education. For to relinquish such right,
 11281	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas not necessary to the Institution of Soveraign Power; nor would there
 11282	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe any reason, why any man should desire to have children, or take the
 11283	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcare to nourish, and instruct them, if they were afterwards to have no
 11284	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother benefit from them, than from other men. And this accordeth with
 11285	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe fifth Commandement.
 11286	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11287	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11288	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11289	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11290	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd To Avoyd Doing Of Injury:
 11291	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11292	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAgain, every Soveraign Ought to cause Justice to be taught, which
 11293	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(consisting in taking from no man what is his) is as much as to say, to
 11294	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcause men to be taught not to deprive their Neighbour, by violence,
 11295	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor fraud, of any thing which by the Soveraign Authority is theirs. Of
 11296	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthings held in propriety, those that are dearest to a man are his own
 11297	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlife, & limbs; and in the next degree, (in most men,) those that
 11298	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconcern conjugall affection; and after them riches and means of living.
 11299	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTherefore the People are to be taught, to abstain from violence to
 11300	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tone anothers person, by private revenges; from violation of conjugall
 11301	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thonour; and from forcibly rapine, and fraudulent surreption of one
 11302	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tanothers goods. For which purpose also it is necessary they be shewed
 11303	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe evill consequences of false Judgement, by corruption either of
 11304	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJudges or Witnesses, whereby the distinction of propriety is taken away,
 11305	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Justice becomes of no effect: all which things are intimated in the
 11306	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth Commandements.
 11307	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11308	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11309	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11310	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11311	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd To Do All This Sincerely From The Heart
 11312	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11313	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLastly, they are to be taught, that not onely the unjust facts, but the
 11314	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdesignes and intentions to do them, (though by accident hindred,) are
 11315	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInjustice; which consisteth in the pravity of the will, as well as in
 11316	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe irregularity of the act. And this is the intention of the tenth
 11317	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommandement, and the summe of the Second Table; which is reduced all to
 11318	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis one Commandement of mutuall Charity, "Thou shalt love thy neighbour
 11319	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas thy selfe:" as the summe of the first Table is reduced to "the love
 11320	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof God;" whom they had then newly received as their King.
 11321	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11322	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11323	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11324	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11325	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Use Of Universities
 11326	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11327	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAs for the Means, and Conduits, by which the people may receive this
 11328	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInstruction, wee are to search, by what means so may Opinions,
 11329	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontrary to the peace of Man-kind, upon weak and false Principles, have
 11330	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tneverthelesse been so deeply rooted in them. I mean those, which I have
 11331	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the precedent Chapter specified: as That men shall Judge of what is
 11332	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlawfull and unlawfull, not by the Law it selfe, but by their own
 11333	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprivate Judgements; That Subjects sinne in obeying the Commands of the
 11334	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth, unlesse they themselves have first judged them to be
 11335	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlawfull: That their Propriety in their riches is such, as to exclude the
 11336	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDominion, which the Common-wealth hath over the same: That it is lawfull
 11337	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor Subjects to kill such, as they call Tyrants: That the Soveraign
 11338	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPower may be divided, and the like; which come to be instilled into
 11339	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe People by this means. They whom necessity, or covetousnesse keepeth
 11340	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tattent on their trades, and labour; and they, on the other side, whom
 11341	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuperfluity, or sloth carrieth after their sensuall pleasures, (which
 11342	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttwo sorts of men take up the greatest part of Man-kind,) being diverted
 11343	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom the deep meditation, which the learning of truth, not onely in the
 11344	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmatter of Naturall Justice, but also of all other Sciences necessarily
 11345	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trequireth, receive the Notions of their duty, chiefly from Divines
 11346	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the Pulpit, and partly from such of their Neighbours, or familiar
 11347	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tacquaintance, as having the Faculty of discoursing readily, and
 11348	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tplausibly, seem wiser and better learned in cases of Law, and
 11349	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConscience, than themselves. And the Divines, and such others as make
 11350	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshew of Learning, derive their knowledge from the Universities, and from
 11351	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Schooles of Law, or from the Books, which by men eminent in
 11352	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose Schooles, and Universities have been published. It is therefore
 11353	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmanifest, that the Instruction of the people, dependeth wholly, on the
 11354	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tright teaching of Youth in the Universities. But are not (may some men
 11355	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsay) the Universities of England learned enough already to do that? or
 11356	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis it you will undertake to teach the Universities? Hard questions. Yet
 11357	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto the first, I doubt not to answer; that till towards the later end of
 11358	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHenry the Eighth, the Power of the Pope, was alwayes upheld against the
 11359	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPower of the Common-wealth, principally by the Universities; and that
 11360	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe doctrines maintained by so many Preachers, against the Soveraign
 11361	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPower of the King, and by so many Lawyers, and others, that had their
 11362	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teducation there, is a sufficient argument, that though the Universities
 11363	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere not authors of those false doctrines, yet they knew not how to
 11364	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tplant the true. For in such a contradiction of Opinions, it is most
 11365	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcertain, that they have not been sufficiently instructed; and 'tis no
 11366	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twonder, if they yet retain a relish of that subtile liquor, wherewith
 11367	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey were first seasoned, against the Civill Authority. But to the later
 11368	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tquestion, it is not fit, nor needfull for me to say either I, or No: for
 11369	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tany man that sees what I am doing, may easily perceive what I think.
 11370	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11371	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe safety of the People, requireth further, from him, or them that have
 11372	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Soveraign Power, that Justice be equally administred to all degrees
 11373	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof People; that is, that as well the rich, and mighty, as poor and
 11374	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobscure persons, may be righted of the injuries done them; so as the
 11375	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgreat, may have no greater hope of impunity, when they doe violence,
 11376	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdishonour, or any Injury to the meaner sort, than when one of these,
 11377	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdoes the like to one of them: For in this consisteth Equity; to which,
 11378	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas being a Precept of the Law of Nature, a Soveraign is as much subject,
 11379	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas any of the meanest of his People. All breaches of the Law, are
 11380	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\toffences against the Common-wealth: but there be some, that are also
 11381	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagainst private Persons. Those that concern the Common-wealth onely, may
 11382	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twithout breach of Equity be pardoned; for every man may pardon what is
 11383	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdone against himselfe, according to his own discretion. But an offence
 11384	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagainst a private man, cannot in Equity be pardoned, without the consent
 11385	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof him that is injured; or reasonable satisfaction.
 11386	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11387	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Inequality of Subjects, proceedeth from the Acts of Soveraign Power;
 11388	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand therefore has no more place in the presence of the Soveraign; that
 11389	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis to say, in a Court of Justice, then the Inequality between Kings,
 11390	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand their Subjects, in the presence of the King of Kings. The honour of
 11391	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgreat Persons, is to be valued for their beneficence, and the aydes
 11392	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey give to men of inferiour rank, or not at all. And the violences,
 11393	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\toppressions, and injuries they do, are not extenuated, but aggravated by
 11394	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe greatnesse of their persons; because they have least need to commit
 11395	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem. The consequences of this partiality towards the great, proceed in
 11396	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis manner. Impunity maketh Insolence; Insolence Hatred; and Hatred,
 11397	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tan Endeavour to pull down all oppressing and contumelious greatnesse,
 11398	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthough with the ruine of the Common-wealth.
 11399	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11400	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11401	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11402	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11403	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEquall Taxes
 11404	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11405	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo Equall Justice, appertaineth also the Equall imposition of Taxes;
 11406	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe equality whereof dependeth not on the Equality of riches, but on the
 11407	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEquality of the debt, that every man oweth to the Common-wealth for his
 11408	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdefence. It is not enough, for a man to labour for the maintenance
 11409	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof his life; but also to fight, (if need be,) for the securing of his
 11410	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlabour. They must either do as the Jewes did after their return from
 11411	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcaptivity, in re-edifying the Temple, build with one hand, and hold the
 11412	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSword in the other; or else they must hire others to fight for them. For
 11413	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Impositions that are layd on the People by the Soveraign Power, are
 11414	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnothing else but the Wages, due to them that hold the publique Sword,
 11415	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto defend private men in the exercise of severall Trades, and Callings.
 11416	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSeeing then the benefit that every one receiveth thereby, is the
 11417	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tenjoyment of life, which is equally dear to poor, and rich; the debt
 11418	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich a poor man oweth them that defend his life, is the same which a
 11419	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trich man oweth for the defence of his; saving that the rich, who have
 11420	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe service of the poor, may be debtors not onely for their own persons,
 11421	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut for many more. Which considered, the Equality of Imposition,
 11422	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsisteth rather in the Equality of that which is consumed, than of the
 11423	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\triches of the persons that consume the same. For what reason is there,
 11424	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat he which laboureth much, and sparing the fruits of his labour,
 11425	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsumeth little, should be more charged, then he that living idlely,
 11426	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgetteth little, and spendeth all he gets; seeing the one hath no
 11427	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmore protection from the Common-wealth, then the other? But when the
 11428	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tImpositions, are layd upon those things which men consume, every man

 11440	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnecessities of Nature require,) by the Lawes of the Common-wealth. For
 11441	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas it is Uncharitablenesse in any man, to neglect the impotent; so it
 11442	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis in the Soveraign of a Common-wealth, to expose them to the hazard of

 11452	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere ought to be such Lawes, as may encourage all manner of Arts; as
 11453	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNavigation, Agriculture, Fishing, and all manner of Manifacture that
 11454	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trequires labour. The multitude of poor, and yet strong people still
 11455	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tencreasing, they are to be transplanted into Countries not sufficiently
 11456	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinhabited: where neverthelesse, they are not to exterminate those they
 11457	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfind there; but constrain them to inhabit closer together, and not range
 11458	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta great deal of ground, to snatch what they find; but to court each
 11459	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlittle Plot with art and labour, to give them their sustenance in due

 11468	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11469	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo the care of the Soveraign, belongeth the making of Good Lawes. But
 11470	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhat is a good Law? By a Good Law, I mean not a Just Law: for no Law can
 11471	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe Unjust. The Law is made by the Soveraign Power, and all that is done
 11472	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby such Power, is warranted, and owned by every one of the people; and
 11473	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat which every man will have so, no man can say is unjust. It is in
 11474	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Lawes of a Common-wealth, as in the Lawes of Gaming: whatsoever
 11475	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Gamesters all agree on, is Injustice to none of them. A good Law
 11476	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis that, which is Needfull, for the Good Of The People, and withall
 11477	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPerspicuous.

 11482	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSuch As Are Necessary
 11483	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11484	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor the use of Lawes, (which are but Rules Authorised) is not to bind
 11485	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe People from all Voluntary actions; but to direct and keep them in
 11486	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch a motion, as not to hurt themselves by their own impetuous desires,
 11487	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trashnesse, or indiscretion, as Hedges are set, not to stop Travellers,
 11488	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut to keep them in the way. And therefore a Law that is not Needfull,
 11489	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thaving not the true End of a Law, is not Good. A Law may be conceived to
 11490	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe Good, when it is for the benefit of the Soveraign; though it be
 11491	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot Necessary for the People; but it is not so. For the good of the
 11492	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign and People, cannot be separated. It is a weak Soveraign, that
 11493	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thas weak Subjects; and a weak People, whose Soveraign wanteth Power to
 11494	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trule them at his will. Unnecessary Lawes are not good Lawes; but trapps
 11495	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor Mony: which where the right of Soveraign Power is acknowledged, are
 11496	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuperfluous; and where it is not acknowledged, unsufficient to defend
 11497	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe People.

 11502	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSuch As Are Perspicuous
 11503	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11504	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Perspicuity, consisteth not so much in the words of the Law it
 11505	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tselfe, as in a Declaration of the Causes, and Motives, for which it was
 11506	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmade. That is it, that shewes us the meaning of the Legislator, and the
 11507	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmeaning of the Legislator known, the Law is more easily understood
 11508	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby few, than many words. For all words, are subject to ambiguity;
 11509	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand therefore multiplication of words in the body of the Law, is
 11510	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmultiplication of ambiguity: Besides it seems to imply, (by too much
 11511	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdiligence,) that whosoever can evade the words, is without the compasse
 11512	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Law. And this is a cause of many unnecessary Processes. For when
 11513	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tI consider how short were the Lawes of antient times; and how they
 11514	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgrew by degrees still longer; me thinks I see a contention between the
 11515	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPenners, and Pleaders of the Law; the former seeking to circumscribe
 11516	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe later; and the later to evade their circumscriptions; and that the
 11517	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPleaders have got the Victory. It belongeth therefore to the Office of
 11518	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Legislator, (such as is in all Common-wealths the Supreme
 11519	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRepresentative, be it one Man, or an Assembly,) to make the reason
 11520	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPerspicuous, why the Law was made; and the Body of the Law it selfe, as
 11521	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshort, but in as proper, and significant termes, as may be.

 11528	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIt belongeth also to the Office of the Soveraign, to make a right
 11529	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tapplication of Punishments, and Rewards. And seeing the end of punishing
 11530	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis not revenge, and discharge of choler; but correction, either of the
 11531	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\toffender, or of others by his example; the severest Punishments are to
 11532	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe inflicted for those Crimes, that are of most Danger to the
 11533	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPublique; such as are those which proceed from malice to the Government
 11534	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\testablished; those that spring from contempt of Justice; those that
 11535	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprovoke Indignation in the Multitude; and those, which unpunished, seem
 11536	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAuthorised, as when they are committed by Sonnes, Servants, or Favorites
 11537	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof men in Authority: For Indignation carrieth men, not onely against the
 11538	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tActors, and Authors of Injustice; but against all Power that is likely
 11539	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto protect them; as in the case of Tarquin; when for the Insolent act of
 11540	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tone of his Sonnes, he was driven out of Rome, and the Monarchy it selfe
 11541	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdissolved. But Crimes of Infirmity; such as are those which proceed
 11542	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom great provocation, from great fear, great need, or from ignorance
 11543	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhether the Fact be a great Crime, or not, there is place many times for
 11544	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLenity, without prejudice to the Common-wealth; and Lenity when there is
 11545	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch place for it, is required by the Law of Nature. The Punishment of
 11546	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Leaders, and teachers in a Commotion; not the poore seduced People,
 11547	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhen they are punished, can profit the Common-wealth by their example.
 11548	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo be severe to the People, is to punish that ignorance, which may in
 11549	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgreat part be imputed to the Soveraign, whose fault it was, they were no
 11550	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbetter instructed.

 11556	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11557	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn like manner it belongeth to the Office, and Duty of the Soveraign,
 11558	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto apply his Rewards alwayes so, as there may arise from them benefit
 11559	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto the Common-wealth: wherein consisteth their Use, and End; and is then
 11560	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdone, when they that have well served the Common-wealth, are with
 11561	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas little expence of the Common Treasure, as is possible, so well
 11562	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trecompenced, as others thereby may be encouraged, both to serve the same
 11563	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas faithfully as they can, and to study the arts by which they may be
 11564	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tenabled to do it better. To buy with Mony, or Preferment, from a Popular
 11565	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tambitious Subject, to be quiet, and desist from making ill impressions
 11566	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the mindes of the People, has nothing of the nature of Reward; (which
 11567	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis ordained not for disservice, but for service past;) nor a signe of
 11568	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGratitude, but of Fear: nor does it tend to the Benefit, but to the
 11569	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDammage of the Publique. It is a contention with Ambition, like that of
 11570	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHercules with the Monster Hydra, which having many heads, for every one
 11571	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat was vanquished, there grew up three. For in like manner, when the
 11572	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tstubbornnesse of one Popular man, is overcome with Reward, there arise
 11573	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmany more (by the Example) that do the same Mischiefe, in hope of like
 11574	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBenefit: and as all sorts of Manifacture, so also Malice encreaseth by
 11575	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeing vendible. And though sometimes a Civill warre, may be differred,
 11576	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby such wayes as that, yet the danger growes still the greater, and the
 11577	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPublique ruine more assured. It is therefore against the Duty of the
 11578	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign, to whom the Publique Safety is committed, to Reward those
 11579	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat aspire to greatnesse by disturbing the Peace of their Country, and
 11580	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot rather to oppose the beginnings of such men, with a little danger,
 11581	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthan after a longer time with greater.

 11586	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCounsellours
 11587	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11588	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnother Businesse of the Soveraign, is to choose good Counsellours;
 11589	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tI mean such, whose advice he is to take in the Government of the
 11590	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth. For this word Counsell, Consilium, corrupted from
 11591	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConsidium, is a large signification, and comprehendeth all Assemblies
 11592	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof men that sit together, not onely to deliberate what is to be done
 11593	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thereafter, but also to judge of Facts past, and of Law for the present.
 11594	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tI take it here in the first sense onely: And in this sense, there is no
 11595	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tchoyce of Counsell, neither in a Democracy, nor Aristocracy; because the
 11596	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpersons Counselling are members of the person Counselled. The choyce
 11597	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Counsellours therefore is to Monarchy; In which, the Soveraign that
 11598	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tendeavoureth not to make choyce of those, that in every kind are the
 11599	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmost able, dischargeth not his Office as he ought to do. The most able
 11600	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCounsellours, are they that have least hope of benefit by giving evill
 11601	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCounsell, and most knowledge of those things that conduce to the Peace,
 11602	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Defence of the Common-wealth. It is a hard matter to know who
 11603	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texpecteth benefit from publique troubles; but the signes that guide to a
 11604	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tjust suspicion, is the soothing of the people in their unreasonable,
 11605	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor irremediable grievances, by men whose estates are not sufficient to
 11606	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdischarge their accustomed expences, and may easily be observed by any
 11607	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tone whom it concerns to know it. But to know, who has most knowledge of
 11608	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Publique affaires, is yet harder; and they that know them, need them
 11609	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta great deale the lesse. For to know, who knowes the Rules almost of any
 11610	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tArt, is a great degree of the knowledge of the same Art; because no
 11611	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman can be assured of the truth of anothers Rules, but he that is first
 11612	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttaught to understand them. But the best signes of Knowledge of any
 11613	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tArt, are, much conversing in it, and constant good effects of it. Good
 11614	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCounsell comes not by Lot, nor by Inheritance; and therefore there is no
 11615	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmore reason to expect good Advice from the rich, or noble, in matter
 11616	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof State, than in delineating the dimensions of a fortresse; unlesse we
 11617	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshall think there needs no method in the study of the Politiques, (as
 11618	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere does in the study of Geometry,) but onely to be lookers on; which
 11619	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis not so. For the Politiques is the harder study of the two. Whereas
 11620	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin these parts of Europe, it hath been taken for a Right of certain
 11621	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpersons, to have place in the highest Councell of State by Inheritance;
 11622	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit is derived from the Conquests of the antient Germans; wherein many
 11623	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tabsolute Lords joyning together to conquer other Nations, would not
 11624	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tenter in to the Confederacy, without such Priviledges, as might be
 11625	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmarks of difference in time following, between their Posterity, and the
 11626	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tposterity of their Subjects; which Priviledges being inconsistent with
 11627	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Soveraign Power, by the favour of the Soveraign, they may seem to
 11628	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tkeep; but contending for them as their Right, they must needs by
 11629	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdegrees let them go, and have at last no further honour, than adhaereth
 11630	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnaturally to their abilities.
 11631	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11632	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd how able soever be the Counsellours in any affaire, the benefit
 11633	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof their Counsell is greater, when they give every one his Advice, and
 11634	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treasons of it apart, than when they do it in an Assembly, by way of
 11635	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOrations; and when they have praemeditated, than when they speak on the
 11636	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsudden; both because they have more time, to survey the consequences
 11637	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof action; and are lesse subject to be carried away to contradiction,
 11638	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthrough Envy, Emulation, or other Passions arising from the difference
 11639	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof opinion.
 11640	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11641	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe best Counsell, in those things that concern not other Nations, but
 11642	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tonely the ease, and benefit the Subjects may enjoy, by Lawes that
 11643	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlook onely inward, is to be taken from the generall informations, and
 11644	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcomplaints of the people of each Province, who are best acquainted
 11645	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith their own wants, and ought therefore, when they demand nothing in
 11646	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tderogation of the essentiall Rights of Soveraignty, to be diligently
 11647	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttaken notice of. For without those Essentiall Rights, (as I have often
 11648	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbefore said,) the Common-wealth cannot at all subsist.

 11654	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11655	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tA Commander of an Army in chiefe, if he be not Popular, shall not be
 11656	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeloved, nor feared as he ought to be by his Army; and consequently
 11657	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcannot performe that office with good successe. He must therefore be
 11658	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIndustrious, Valiant, Affable, Liberall and Fortunate, that he may gain
 11659	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tan opinion both of sufficiency, and of loving his Souldiers. This is
 11660	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPopularity, and breeds in the Souldiers both desire, and courage, to
 11661	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trecommend themselves to his favour; and protects the severity of
 11662	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Generall, in punishing (when need is) the Mutinous, or negligent
 11663	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSouldiers. But this love of Souldiers, (if caution be not given of
 11664	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Commanders fidelity,) is a dangerous thing to Soveraign Power;
 11665	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tespecially when it is in the hands of an Assembly not popular. It
 11666	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbelongeth therefore to the safety of the People, both that they be good
 11667	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConductors, and faithfull subjects, to whom the Soveraign Commits his
 11668	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tArmies.
 11669	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11670	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut when the Soveraign himselfe is Popular, that is, reverenced and
 11671	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeloved of his People, there is no danger at all from the Popularity of
 11672	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Subject. For Souldiers are never so generally unjust, as to side with
 11673	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir Captain; though they love him, against their Soveraign, when they
 11674	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlove not onely his Person, but also his Cause. And therefore those,
 11675	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twho by violence have at any time suppressed the Power of their Lawfull
 11676	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign, before they could settle themselves in his place, have been
 11677	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talwayes put to the trouble of contriving their Titles, to save the
 11678	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPeople from the shame of receiving them. To have a known Right to
 11679	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign Power, is so popular a quality, as he that has it needs no
 11680	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmore, for his own part, to turn the hearts of his Subjects to him, but
 11681	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat they see him able absolutely to govern his own Family: Nor, on the
 11682	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpart of his enemies, but a disbanding of their Armies. For the greatest
 11683	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand most active part of Mankind, has never hetherto been well contented

 11686	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConcerning the Offices of one Soveraign to another, which are
 11687	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcomprehended in that Law, which is commonly called the Law of Nations,
 11688	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tI need not say any thing in this place; because the Law of Nations, and
 11689	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Law of Nature, is the same thing. And every Soveraign hath the same
 11690	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRight, in procuring the safety of his People, that any particular man
 11691	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcan have, in procuring the safety of his own Body. And the same Law,
 11692	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat dictateth to men that have no Civil Government, what they ought to
 11693	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdo, and what to avoyd in regard of one another, dictateth the same to
 11694	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealths, that is, to the Consciences of Soveraign Princes, and
 11695	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign Assemblies; there being no Court of Naturall Justice, but
 11696	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the Conscience onely; where not Man, but God raigneth; whose Lawes,
 11697	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(such of them as oblige all Mankind,) in respect of God, as he is the
 11698	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAuthor of Nature, are Naturall; and in respect of the same God, as he is
 11699	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKing of Kings, are Lawes. But of the Kingdome of God, as King of Kings,
 11700	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand as King also of a peculiar People, I shall speak in the rest of this
 11701	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdiscourse.

 11710	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Scope Of The Following Chapters
 11711	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11712	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThat the condition of meer Nature, that is to say, of absolute Liberty,
 11713	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch as is theirs, that neither are Soveraigns, nor Subjects, is
 11714	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnarchy, and the condition of Warre: That the Praecepts, by which men
 11715	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare guided to avoyd that condition, are the Lawes of Nature: That
 11716	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Common-wealth, without Soveraign Power, is but a word, without
 11717	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsubstance, and cannot stand: That Subjects owe to Soveraigns, simple
 11718	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tObedience, in all things, wherein their obedience is not repugnant
 11719	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto the Lawes of God, I have sufficiently proved, in that which I have
 11720	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talready written. There wants onely, for the entire knowledge of Civill
 11721	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tduty, to know what are those Lawes of God. For without that, a man knows
 11722	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot, when he is commanded any thing by the Civill Power, whether it be
 11723	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontrary to the Law of God, or not: and so, either by too much civill
 11724	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobedience, offends the Divine Majesty, or through feare of offending
 11725	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod, transgresses the commandements of the Common-wealth. To avoyd both
 11726	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthese Rocks, it is necessary to know what are the Lawes Divine. And
 11727	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tseeing the knowledge of all Law, dependeth on the knowledge of the
 11728	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign Power; I shall say something in that which followeth, of the
 11729	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKINGDOME OF GOD.
 11730	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11731	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11732	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11733	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11734	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWho Are Subjects In The Kingdome Of God
 11735	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11736	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"God is King, let the Earth rejoice," saith the Psalmist. (Psal. 96. 1).
 11737	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd again, "God is King though the Nations be angry; and he that sitteth
 11738	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ton the Cherubins, though the earth be moved." (Psal. 98. 1). Whether
 11739	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen will or not, they must be subject alwayes to the Divine Power. By
 11740	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdenying the Existence, or Providence of God, men may shake off their
 11741	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEase, but not their Yoke. But to call this Power of God, which extendeth
 11742	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit selfe not onely to Man, but also to Beasts, and Plants, and Bodies
 11743	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinanimate, by the name of Kingdome, is but a metaphoricall use of
 11744	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe word. For he onely is properly said to Raigne, that governs his
 11745	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSubjects, by his Word, and by promise of Rewards to those that obey
 11746	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit, and by threatning them with Punishment that obey it not. Subjects
 11747	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore in the Kingdome of God, are not Bodies Inanimate, nor
 11748	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcreatures Irrationall; because they understand no Precepts as his: Nor
 11749	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAtheists; nor they that believe not that God has any care of the actions
 11750	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof mankind; because they acknowledge no Word for his, nor have hope of
 11751	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this rewards, or fear of his threatnings. They therefore that believe
 11752	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere is a God that governeth the world, and hath given Praecepts, and
 11753	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpropounded Rewards, and Punishments to Mankind, are Gods Subjects; all
 11754	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe rest, are to be understood as Enemies.
 11755	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t

 11757	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11758	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11759	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tA Threefold Word Of God, Reason, Revelation, Prophecy
 11760	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11761	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo rule by Words, requires that such Words be manifestly made known;
 11762	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor else they are no Lawes: For to the nature of Lawes belongeth a
 11763	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsufficient, and clear Promulgation, such as may take away the excuse of
 11764	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIgnorance; which in the Lawes of men is but of one onely kind, and that
 11765	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis, Proclamation, or Promulgation by the voyce of man. But God
 11766	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdeclareth his Lawes three wayes; by the Dictates of Naturall Reason, By
 11767	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRevelation, and by the Voyce of some Man, to whom by the operation of
 11768	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMiracles, he procureth credit with the rest. From hence there ariseth
 11769	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta triple Word of God, Rational, Sensible, and Prophetique: to which
 11770	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCorrespondeth a triple Hearing; Right Reason, Sense Supernaturall, and
 11771	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFaith. As for Sense Supernaturall, which consisteth in Revelation, or
 11772	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInspiration, there have not been any Universall Lawes so given, because
 11773	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod speaketh not in that manner, but to particular persons, and to
 11774	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdivers men divers things.
 11775	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11776	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tA Twofold Kingdome Of God, Naturall And Prophetique From the difference
 11777	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbetween the other two kinds of Gods Word, Rationall, and Prophetique,
 11778	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere may be attributed to God, a two-fold Kingdome, Naturall, and
 11779	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tProphetique: Naturall, wherein he governeth as many of Mankind as
 11780	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tacknowledge his Providence, by the naturall Dictates of Right Reason;
 11781	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd Prophetique, wherein having chosen out one peculiar Nation (the
 11782	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJewes) for his Subjects, he governed them, and none but them, not onely
 11783	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby naturall Reason, but by Positive Lawes, which he gave them by the
 11784	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmouths of his holy Prophets. Of the Naturall Kingdome of God I intend to
 11785	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tspeak in this Chapter.
 11786	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11787	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Right Of Gods Soveraignty Is Derived From His Omnipotence The Right
 11788	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Nature, whereby God reigneth over men, and punisheth those that
 11789	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbreak his Lawes, is to be derived, not from his Creating them, as if
 11790	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the required obedience, as of Gratitude for his benefits; but from his
 11791	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIrresistible Power. I have formerly shewn, how the Soveraign Right
 11792	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tariseth from Pact: To shew how the same Right may arise from Nature,
 11793	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trequires no more, but to shew in what case it is never taken away.
 11794	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSeeing all men by Nature had Right to All things, they had Right every
 11795	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tone to reigne over all the rest. But because this Right could not be
 11796	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobtained by force, it concerned the safety of every one, laying by that
 11797	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRight, to set up men (with Soveraign Authority) by common consent,
 11798	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto rule and defend them: whereas if there had been any man of Power
 11799	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIrresistible; there had been no reason, why he should not by that Power
 11800	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave ruled, and defended both himselfe, and them, according to his own
 11801	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdiscretion. To those therefore whose Power is irresistible, the dominion
 11802	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof all men adhaereth naturally by their excellence of Power; and
 11803	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsequently it is from that Power, that the Kingdome over men, and
 11804	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Right of afflicting men at his pleasure, belongeth Naturally to God
 11805	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAlmighty; not as Creator, and Gracious; but as Omnipotent. And though
 11806	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPunishment be due for Sinne onely, because by that word is understood
 11807	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAffliction for Sinne; yet the Right of Afflicting, is not alwayes
 11808	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tderived from mens Sinne, but from Gods Power.
 11809	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11810	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11811	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11812	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11813	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSinne Not The Cause Of All Affliction
 11814	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11815	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThis question, "Why Evill men often Prosper, and Good men suffer
 11816	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAdversity," has been much disputed by the Antient, and is the same
 11817	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith this of ours, "By what Right God dispenseth the Prosperities and
 11818	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAdversities of this life;" and is of that difficulty, as it hath shaken
 11819	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe faith, not onely of the Vulgar, but of Philosophers, and which is
 11820	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmore, of the Saints, concerning the Divine Providence. "How Good," saith
 11821	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDavid, "is the God of Israel to those that are Upright in Heart; and yet
 11822	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmy feet were almost gone, my treadings had well-nigh slipt; for I was
 11823	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgrieved at the Wicked, when I saw the Ungodly in such Prosperity."
 11824	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd Job, how earnestly does he expostulate with God, for the many
 11825	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAfflictions he suffered, notwithstanding his Righteousnesse? This
 11826	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tquestion in the case of Job, is decided by God himselfe, not by
 11827	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\targuments derived from Job's Sinne, but his own Power. For whereas the
 11828	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfriends of Job drew their arguments from his Affliction to his Sinne,
 11829	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand he defended himselfe by the conscience of his Innocence, God
 11830	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thimselfe taketh up the matter, and having justified the Affliction by
 11831	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\targuments drawn from his Power, such as this "Where was thou when I
 11832	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlayd the foundations of the earth," and the like, both approved
 11833	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJob's Innocence, and reproved the Erroneous doctrine of his friends.
 11834	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConformable to this doctrine is the sentence of our Saviour, concerning
 11835	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe man that was born Blind, in these words, "Neither hath this man
 11836	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsinned, nor his fathers; but that the works of God might be made
 11837	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmanifest in him." And though it be said "That Death entred into the
 11838	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tworld by sinne," (by which is meant that if Adam had never sinned, he had
 11839	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnever dyed, that is, never suffered any separation of his soule from his
 11840	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbody,) it follows not thence, that God could not justly have Afflicted
 11841	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim, though he had not Sinned, as well as he afflicteth other living
 11842	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcreatures, that cannot sinne.
 11843	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11844	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11845	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11846	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11847	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDivine Lawes
 11848	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11849	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHaving spoken of the Right of Gods Soveraignty, as grounded onely on
 11850	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNature; we are to consider next, what are the Divine Lawes, or Dictates
 11851	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Naturall Reason; which Lawes concern either the naturall Duties of
 11852	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tone man to another, or the Honour naturally due to our Divine Soveraign.
 11853	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe first are the same Lawes of Nature, of which I have spoken already
 11854	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the 14. and 15. Chapters of this Treatise; namely, Equity, Justice,
 11855	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMercy, Humility, and the rest of the Morall Vertues. It remaineth
 11856	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore that we consider, what Praecepts are dictated to men, by their
 11857	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNaturall Reason onely, without other word of God, touching the Honour
 11858	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Worship of the Divine Majesty.
 11859	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11860	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11861	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11862	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11863	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHonour And Worship What
 11864	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11865	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHonour consisteth in the inward thought, and opinion of the Power, and
 11866	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGoodnesse of another: and therefore to Honour God, is to think as Highly
 11867	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof his Power and Goodnesse, as is possible. And of that opinion, the
 11868	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texternall signes appearing in the Words, and Actions of men, are called
 11869	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWorship; which is one part of that which the Latines understand by the
 11870	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tword Cultus: For Cultus signifieth properly, and constantly, that labour
 11871	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich a man bestowes on any thing, with a purpose to make benefit by it.
 11872	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNow those things whereof we make benefit, are either subject to us, and
 11873	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe profit they yeeld, followeth the labour we bestow upon them, as a
 11874	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnaturall effect; or they are not subject to us, but answer our labour,
 11875	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\taccording to their own Wills. In the first sense the labour bestowed on
 11876	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Earth, is called Culture; and the education of Children a Culture of
 11877	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir mindes. In the second sense, where mens wills are to be wrought to
 11878	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tour purpose, not by Force, but by Compleasance, it signifieth as much as
 11879	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCourting, that is, a winning of favour by good offices; as by praises,
 11880	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby acknowledging their Power, and by whatsoever is pleasing to them from
 11881	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhom we look for any benefit. And this is properly Worship: in which
 11882	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsense Publicola, is understood for a Worshipper of the People, and
 11883	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCultus Dei, for the Worship of God.
 11884	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11885	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11886	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11887	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11888	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSeverall Signes Of Honour
 11889	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11890	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFrom internall Honour, consisting in the opinion of Power and Goodnesse,
 11891	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tarise three Passions; Love, which hath reference to Goodnesse; and Hope,
 11892	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Fear, that relate to Power: And three parts of externall worship;
 11893	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPraise, Magnifying, and Blessing: The subject of Praise, being
 11894	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGoodnesse; the subject of Magnifying, and Blessing, being Power, and the
 11895	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teffect thereof Felicity. Praise, and Magnifying are significant both by
 11896	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWords, and Actions: By Words, when we say a man is Good, or Great:
 11897	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBy Actions, when we thank him for his Bounty, and obey his Power. The
 11898	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\topinion of the Happinesse of another, can onely be expressed by words.
 11899	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11900	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11901	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11902	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11903	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWorship Naturall And Arbitrary
 11904	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11905	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThere be some signes of Honour, (both in Attributes and Actions,) that
 11906	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe Naturally so; as amongst Attributes, Good, Just, Liberall, and the
 11907	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlike; and amongst Actions, Prayers, Thanks, and Obedience. Others are
 11908	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tso by Institution, or Custome of men; and in some times and places are
 11909	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHonourable; in others Dishonourable; in others Indifferent: such as are
 11910	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Gestures in Salutation, Prayer, and Thanksgiving, in different
 11911	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttimes and places, differently used. The former is Naturall; the later
 11912	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tArbitrary Worship.
 11913	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11914	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11915	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11916	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11917	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWorship Commanded And Free
 11918	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11919	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd of Arbitrary Worship, there bee two differences: For sometimes it is
 11920	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Commanded, sometimes Voluntary Worship: Commanded, when it is such
 11921	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas hee requireth, who is Worshipped: Free, when it is such as the
 11922	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWorshipper thinks fit. When it is Commanded, not the words, or gestures,
 11923	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut the obedience is the Worship. But when Free, the Worship consists
 11924	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the opinion of the beholders: for if to them the words, or actions by
 11925	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich we intend honour, seem ridiculous, and tending to contumely; they
 11926	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare not Worship; because a signe is not a signe to him that giveth it,
 11927	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut to him to whom it is made; that is, to the spectator.
 11928	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11929	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11930	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11931	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11932	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWorship Publique And Private
 11933	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11934	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAgain, there is a Publique, and a Private Worship. Publique, is the
 11935	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWorship that a Common-wealth performeth, as one Person. Private, is that
 11936	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich a Private person exhibiteth. Publique, in respect of the whole
 11937	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth, is Free; but in respect of Particular men it is not so.
 11938	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPrivate, is in secret Free; but in the sight of the multitude, it is
 11939	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnever without some Restraint, either from the Lawes, or from the Opinion
 11940	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof men; which is contrary to the nature of Liberty.

 11945	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe End Of Worship
 11946	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11947	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe End of Worship amongst men, is Power. For where a man seeth another
 11948	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tworshipped he supposeth him powerfull, and is the readier to obey him;
 11949	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich makes his Power greater. But God has no Ends: the worship we do
 11950	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim, proceeds from our duty, and is directed according to our capacity,
 11951	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby those rules of Honour, that Reason dictateth to be done by the weak
 11952	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto the more potent men, in hope of benefit, for fear of dammage, or in
 11953	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthankfulnesse for good already received from them.

 11958	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAttributes Of Divine Honour
 11959	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11960	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThat we may know what worship of God is taught us by the light of
 11961	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNature, I will begin with his Attributes. Where, First, it is manifest,
 11962	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twe ought to attribute to him Existence: For no man can have the will to
 11963	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thonour that, which he thinks not to have any Beeing.
 11964	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11965	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSecondly, that those Philosophers, who sayd the World, or the Soule of
 11966	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe World was God, spake unworthily of him; and denyed his Existence:
 11967	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor by God, is understood the cause of the World; and to say the World
 11968	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis God, is to say there is no cause of it, that is, no God.
 11969	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11970	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThirdly, to say the World was not Created, but Eternall, (seeing that
 11971	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich is Eternall has no cause,) is to deny there is a God.
 11972	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11973	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFourthly, that they who attributing (as they think) Ease to God, take
 11974	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom him the care of Mankind; take from him his Honour: for it takes
 11975	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\taway mens love, and fear of him; which is the root of Honour.
 11976	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11977	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFifthly, in those things that signifie Greatnesse, and Power; to say he
 11978	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis Finite, is not to Honour him: For it is not a signe of the Will to
 11979	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHonour God, to attribute to him lesse than we can; and Finite, is lesse
 11980	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthan we can; because to Finite, it is easie to adde more.
 11981	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11982	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTherefore to attribute Figure to him, is not Honour; for all Figure is
 11983	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFinite:
 11984	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11985	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNor to say we conceive, and imagine, or have an Idea of him, in our
 11986	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmind: for whatsoever we conceive is Finite:
 11987	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11988	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNot to attribute to him Parts, or Totality; which are the Attributes
 11989	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tonely of things Finite:
 11990	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11991	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNor to say he is this, or that Place: for whatsoever is in Place, is
 11992	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbounded, and Finite:
 11993	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11994	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNor that he is Moved, or Resteth: for both these Attributes ascribe to
 11995	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim Place:
 11996	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 11997	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNor that there be more Gods than one; because it implies them all
 11998	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFinite: for there cannot be more than one Infinite: Nor to ascribe to
 11999	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim (unlesse Metaphorically, meaning not the Passion, but the Effect)
 12000	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPassions that partake of Griefe; as Repentance, Anger, Mercy: or of
 12001	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWant; as Appetite, Hope, Desire; or of any Passive faculty: For Passion,
 12002	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis Power limited by somewhat else.
 12003	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12004	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd therefore when we ascribe to God a Will, it is not to be understood,
 12005	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas that of Man, for a Rationall Appetite; but as the Power, by which he
 12006	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teffecteth every thing.
 12007	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12008	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLikewise when we attribute to him Sight, and other acts of Sense; as
 12009	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talso Knowledge, and Understanding; which in us is nothing else, but
 12010	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta tumult of the mind, raised by externall things that presse the
 12011	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\torganicall parts of mans body: For there is no such thing in God; and
 12012	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeing things that depend on naturall causes, cannot be attributed to
 12013	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim.
 12014	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12015	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHee that will attribute to God, nothing but what is warranted by
 12016	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnaturall Reason, must either use such Negative Attributes, as Infinite,
 12017	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEternall, Incomprehensible; or Superlatives, as Most High, Most Great,
 12018	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand the like; or Indefinite, as Good, Just, Holy, Creator; and in such
 12019	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsense, as if he meant not to declare what he is, (for that were to
 12020	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcircumscribe him within the limits of our Fancy,) but how much wee
 12021	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tadmire him, and how ready we would be to obey him; which is a signe of
 12022	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHumility, and of a Will to honour him as much as we can: For there is
 12023	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut one Name to signifie our Conception of his Nature, and that is, I
 12024	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAM: and but one Name of his Relation to us, and that is God; in which is
 12025	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontained Father, King, and Lord.
 12026	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12027	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12028	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12029	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12030	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tActions That Are Signes Of Divine Honour
 12031	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12032	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConcerning the actions of Divine Worship, it is a most generall Precept
 12033	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Reason, that they be signes of the Intention to Honour God; such as
 12034	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare, First, Prayers: For not the Carvers, when they made Images, were
 12035	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthought to make them Gods; but the People that Prayed to them.
 12036	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12037	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSecondly, Thanksgiving; which differeth from Prayer in Divine Worship,
 12038	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tno otherwise, than that Prayers precede, and Thanks succeed the benefit;
 12039	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe end both of the one, and the other, being to acknowledge God, for
 12040	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAuthor of all benefits, as well past, as future.
 12041	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12042	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThirdly, Gifts; that is to say, Sacrifices, and Oblations, (if they be
 12043	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the best,) are signes of Honour: for they are Thanksgivings.
 12044	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12045	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFourthly, Not to swear by any but God, is naturally a signe of Honour:
 12046	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor it is a confession that God onely knoweth the heart; and that no
 12047	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmans wit, or strength can protect a man against Gods vengence on the
 12048	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tperjured.
 12049	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12050	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFifthly, it is a part of Rationall Worship, to speak Considerately
 12051	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof God; for it argues a Fear of him, and Fear, is a confession of his
 12052	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPower. Hence followeth, That the name of God is not to be used rashly,
 12053	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand to no purpose; for that is as much, as in Vain: And it is to
 12054	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tno purpose; unlesse it be by way of Oath, and by order of the
 12055	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth, to make Judgements certain; or between Common-wealths,
 12056	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto avoyd Warre. And that disputing of Gods nature is contrary to his
 12057	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHonour: For it is supposed, that in this naturall Kingdome of God, there
 12058	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis no other way to know any thing, but by naturall Reason; that is, from
 12059	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Principles of naturall Science; which are so farre from teaching us
 12060	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tany thing of Gods nature, as they cannot teach us our own nature, nor
 12061	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe nature of the smallest creature living. And therefore, when men out
 12062	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Principles of naturall Reason, dispute of the Attributes of God,
 12063	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey but dishonour him: For in the Attributes which we give to God, we
 12064	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare not to consider the signification of Philosophicall Truth; but the
 12065	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsignification of Pious Intention, to do him the greatest Honour we are
 12066	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\table. From the want of which consideration, have proceeded the volumes
 12067	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof disputation about the Nature of God, that tend not to his Honour, but
 12068	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto the honour of our own wits, and learning; and are nothing else but
 12069	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinconsiderate, and vain abuses of his Sacred Name.
 12070	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12071	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSixthly, in Prayers, Thanksgivings, Offerings and Sacrifices, it is a
 12072	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDictate of naturall Reason, that they be every one in his kind the
 12073	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbest, and most significant of Honour. As for example, that Prayers, and
 12074	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThanksgiving, be made in Words and Phrases, not sudden, nor light, nor
 12075	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPlebeian; but beautifull and well composed; For else we do not God
 12076	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas much honour as we can. And therefore the Heathens did absurdly, to
 12077	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tworship Images for Gods: But their doing it in Verse, and with Musick,
 12078	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tboth of Voyce, and Instruments, was reasonable. Also that the Beasts
 12079	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey offered in sacrifice, and the Gifts they offered, and their actions
 12080	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin Worshipping, were full of submission, and commemorative of benefits
 12081	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treceived, was according to reason, as proceeding from an intention to
 12082	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thonour him.
 12083	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12084	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSeventhly, Reason directeth not onely to worship God in Secret; but
 12085	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talso, and especially, in Publique, and in the sight of men: For without
 12086	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat, (that which in honour is most acceptable) the procuring others to
 12087	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thonour him, is lost.
 12088	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12089	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLastly, Obedience to his Lawes (that is, in this case to the Lawes
 12090	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Nature,) is the greatest worship of all. For as Obedience is
 12091	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmore acceptable to God than sacrifice; so also to set light by his
 12092	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommandements, is the greatest of all contumelies. And these are the
 12093	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLawes of that Divine Worship, which naturall Reason dictateth to private
 12094	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen.
 12095	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12096	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12097	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12098	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12099	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPublique Worship Consisteth In Uniformity
 12100	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12101	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut seeing a Common-wealth is but one Person, it ought also to exhibite
 12102	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto God but one Worship; which then it doth, when it commandeth it to be
 12103	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texhibited by Private men, Publiquely. And this is Publique Worship; the
 12104	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tproperty whereof, is to be Uniforme: For those actions that are done
 12105	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdifferently, by different men, cannot be said to be a Publique Worship.
 12106	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd therefore, where many sorts of Worship be allowed, proceeding from
 12107	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe different Religions of Private men, it cannot be said there is any
 12108	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPublique Worship, nor that the Common-wealth is of any Religion at all.
 12109	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12110	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12111	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12112	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12113	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAll Attributes Depend On The Lawes Civill
 12114	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12115	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd because words (and consequently the Attributes of God) have their
 12116	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsignification by agreement, and constitution of men; those Attributes
 12117	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare to be held significative of Honour, that men intend shall so be; and
 12118	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhatsoever may be done by the wills of particular men, where there is no
 12119	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaw but Reason, may be done by the will of the Common-wealth, by Lawes
 12120	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCivill. And because a Common-wealth hath no Will, nor makes no Lawes,
 12121	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut those that are made by the Will of him, or them that have the
 12122	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign Power; it followeth, that those Attributes which the Soveraign
 12123	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tordaineth, in the Worship of God, for signes of Honour, ought to be
 12124	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttaken and used for such, by private men in their publique Worship.
 12125	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12126	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12127	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12128	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12129	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNot All Actions
 12130	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12131	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut because not all Actions are signes by Constitution; but some are
 12132	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNaturally signes of Honour, others of Contumely, these later (which are
 12133	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose that men are ashamed to do in the sight of them they reverence)
 12134	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcannot be made by humane power a part of Divine worship; nor the former
 12135	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(such as are decent, modest, humble Behaviour) ever be separated from
 12136	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit. But whereas there be an infinite number of Actions, and Gestures, of
 12137	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tan indifferent nature; such of them as the Common-wealth shall ordain to
 12138	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe Publiquely and Universally in use, as signes of Honour, and part of
 12139	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGods Worship, are to be taken and used for such by the Subjects. And
 12140	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat which is said in the Scripture, "It is better to obey God than
 12141	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen," hath place in the kingdome of God by Pact, and not by Nature.
 12142	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12143	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12144	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12145	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12146	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNaturall Punishments
 12147	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12148	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHaving thus briefly spoken of the Naturall Kingdome of God, and his
 12149	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNaturall Lawes, I will adde onely to this Chapter a short declaration of
 12150	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this Naturall Punishments. There is no action of man in this life, that
 12151	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis not the beginning of so long a chayn of Consequences, as no humane
 12152	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tProvidence, is high enough, to give a man a prospect to the end. And
 12153	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin this Chayn, there are linked together both pleasing and unpleasing
 12154	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevents; in such manner, as he that will do any thing for his pleasure,
 12155	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmust engage himselfe to suffer all the pains annexed to it; and these
 12156	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpains, are the Naturall Punishments of those actions, which are the
 12157	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeginning of more Harme that Good. And hereby it comes to passe, that
 12158	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIntemperance, is naturally punished with Diseases; Rashnesse, with
 12159	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMischances; Injustice, with the Violence of Enemies; Pride, with Ruine;
 12160	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCowardise, with Oppression; Negligent government of Princes, with
 12161	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRebellion; and Rebellion, with Slaughter. For seeing Punishments
 12162	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare consequent to the breach of Lawes; Naturall Punishments must be
 12163	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnaturally consequent to the breach of the Lawes of Nature; and therfore
 12164	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfollow them as their naturall, not arbitrary effects.
 12165	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12166	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12167	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12168	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12169	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Conclusion Of The Second Part
 12170	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12171	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd thus farre concerning the Constitution, Nature, and Right of
 12172	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraigns; and concerning the Duty of Subjects, derived from the
 12173	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPrinciples of Naturall Reason. And now, considering how different
 12174	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis Doctrine is, from the Practise of the greatest part of the world,
 12175	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tespecially of these Western parts, that have received their Morall
 12176	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlearning from Rome, and Athens; and how much depth of Morall Philosophy
 12177	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis required, in them that have the Administration of the Soveraign
 12178	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPower; I am at the point of believing this my labour, as uselesse,
 12179	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand the Common-wealth of Plato; For he also is of opinion that it is
 12180	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\timpossible for the disorders of State, and change of Governments by
 12181	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCivill Warre, ever to be taken away, till Soveraigns be Philosophers.
 12182	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut when I consider again, that the Science of Naturall Justice, is the
 12183	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tonely Science necessary for Soveraigns, and their principall Ministers;
 12184	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand that they need not be charged with the Sciences Mathematicall, (as
 12185	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby Plato they are,) further, than by good Lawes to encourage men to
 12186	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe study of them; and that neither Plato, nor any other Philosopher
 12187	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thitherto, hath put into order, and sufficiently, or probably proved all
 12188	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Theoremes of Morall doctrine, that men may learn thereby, both how
 12189	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto govern, and how to obey; I recover some hope, that one time or other,
 12190	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis writing of mine, may fall into the hands of a Soveraign, who will
 12191	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsider it himselfe, (for it is short, and I think clear,) without the
 12192	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thelp of any interested, or envious Interpreter; and by the exercise of
 12193	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tentire Soveraignty, in protecting the Publique teaching of it, convert
 12194	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis Truth of Speculation, into the Utility of Practice.

 12210	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf Christian Politiques
 12211	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12212	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tI have derived the Rights of Soveraigne Power, and the duty of Subjects

 12215	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis to say, from the nature of Men, known to us by Experience, and
 12216	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom Definitions (of such words as are Essentiall to all Politicall
 12217	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treasoning) universally agreed on. But in that I am next to handle, which
 12218	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis the Nature and Rights of a CHRISTIAN COMMON-WEALTH, whereof there
 12219	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdependeth much upon Supernaturall Revelations of the Will of God; the
 12220	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tground of my Discourse must be, not only the Naturall Word of God, but
 12221	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talso the Propheticall.
 12222	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12223	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNeverthelesse, we are not to renounce our Senses, and Experience; nor
 12224	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(that which is the undoubted Word of God) our naturall Reason. For they
 12225	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare the talents which he hath put into our hands to negotiate, till the
 12226	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcoming again of our blessed Saviour; and therefore not to be folded up
 12227	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the Napkin of an Implicate Faith, but employed in the purchase of
 12228	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJustice, Peace, and true Religion, For though there be many things in
 12229	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGods Word above Reason; that is to say, which cannot by naturall reason
 12230	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe either demonstrated, or confuted; yet there is nothing contrary
 12231	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto it; but when it seemeth so, the fault is either in our unskilfull
 12232	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInterpretation, or erroneous Ratiocination.
 12233	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12234	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTherefore, when any thing therein written is too hard for our
 12235	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texamination, wee are bidden to captivate our understanding to the Words;
 12236	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand not to labour in sifting out a Philosophicall truth by Logick, of
 12237	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch mysteries as are not comprehensible, nor fall under any rule of
 12238	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnaturall science. For it is with the mysteries of our Religion, as with
 12239	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twholsome pills for the sick, which swallowed whole, have the vertue to
 12240	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcure; but chewed, are for the most part cast up again without effect.

 12245	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhat It Is To Captivate The Understanding
 12246	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12247	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut by the Captivity of our Understanding, is not meant a Submission of
 12248	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Intellectual faculty, to the Opinion of any other man; but of
 12249	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Will to Obedience, where obedience is due. For Sense, Memory,
 12250	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tUnderstanding, Reason, and Opinion are not in our power to change; but
 12251	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talwaies, and necessarily such, as the things we see, hear, and consider
 12252	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuggest unto us; and therefore are not effects of our Will, but our Will
 12253	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof them. We then Captivate our Understanding and Reason, when we forbear
 12254	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontradiction; when we so speak, as (by lawfull Authority) we are
 12255	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommanded; and when we live accordingly; which in sum, is Trust, and
 12256	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFaith reposed in him that speaketh, though the mind be incapable of any
 12257	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNotion at all from the words spoken.

 12262	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHow God Speaketh To Men
 12263	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12264	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhen God speaketh to man, it must be either immediately; or by mediation
 12265	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof another man, to whom he had formerly spoken by himself immediately.
 12266	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHow God speaketh to a man immediately, may be understood by those well
 12267	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tenough, to whom he hath so spoken; but how the same should be understood
 12268	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby another, is hard, if not impossible to know. For if a man pretend to
 12269	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tme, that God hath spoken to him supernaturally, and immediately, and I
 12270	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmake doubt of it, I cannot easily perceive what argument he can produce,
 12271	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto oblige me to beleeve it. It is true, that if he be my Soveraign,
 12272	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the may oblige me to obedience, so, as not by act or word to declare I
 12273	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeleeve him not; but not to think any otherwise then my reason perswades
 12274	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tme. But if one that hath not such authority over me, shall pretend the
 12275	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsame, there is nothing that exacteth either beleefe, or obedience.
 12276	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12277	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor to say that God hath spoken to him in the Holy Scripture, is not
 12278	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto say God hath spoken to him immediately, but by mediation of the
 12279	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tProphets, or of the Apostles, or of the Church, in such manner as he
 12280	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tspeaks to all other Christian men. To say he hath spoken to him in a
 12281	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDream, is no more than to say he dreamed that God spake to him; which is
 12282	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot of force to win beleef from any man, that knows dreams are for
 12283	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe most part naturall, and may proceed from former thoughts; and such
 12284	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdreams as that, from selfe conceit, and foolish arrogance, and false
 12285	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\topinion of a mans own godlinesse, or other vertue, by which he thinks he
 12286	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thath merited the favour of extraordinary Revelation. To say he hath
 12287	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tseen a Vision, or heard a Voice, is to say, that he hath dreamed between
 12288	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsleeping and waking: for in such manner a man doth many times naturally
 12289	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttake his dream for a vision, as not having well observed his own
 12290	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tslumbering. To say he speaks by supernaturall Inspiration, is to say he
 12291	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfinds an ardent desire to speak, or some strong opinion of himself, for
 12292	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich he can alledge no naturall and sufficient reason. So that
 12293	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthough God Almighty can speak to a man, by Dreams, Visions, Voice, and
 12294	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInspiration; yet he obliges no man to beleeve he hath so done to him
 12295	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat pretends it; who (being a man), may erre, and (which is more) may
 12296	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlie.

 12301	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBy What Marks Prophets Are Known
 12302	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12303	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHow then can he, to whom God hath never revealed his Wil immediately
 12304	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(saving by the way of natural reason) know when he is to obey, or not
 12305	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto obey his Word, delivered by him, that sayes he is a Prophet? (1 Kings
 12306	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t22) Of 400 Prophets, of whom the K. of Israel asked counsel, concerning
 12307	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe warre he made against Ramoth Gilead, only Micaiah was a true one.(1
 12308	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKings 13) The Prophet that was sent to prophecy against the Altar set up
 12309	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby Jeroboam, though a true Prophet, and that by two miracles done in
 12310	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this presence appears to be a Prophet sent from God, was yet deceived by
 12311	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tanother old Prophet, that perswaded him as from the mouth of God, to eat
 12312	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand drink with him. If one Prophet deceive another, what certainty is
 12313	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere of knowing the will of God, by other way than that of Reason? To
 12314	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich I answer out of the Holy Scripture, that there be two marks, by
 12315	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich together, not asunder, a true Prophet is to be known. One is the
 12316	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdoing of miracles; the other is the not teaching any other Religion than
 12317	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat which is already established. Asunder (I say) neither of these is
 12318	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsufficient. (Deut. 13 v. 1,2,3,4,5 ) "If a Prophet rise amongst you, or
 12319	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Dreamer of dreams, and shall pretend the doing of a miracle, and the
 12320	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmiracle come to passe; if he say, Let us follow strange Gods, which thou
 12321	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thast not known, thou shalt not hearken to him, &c. But that Prophet and
 12322	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDreamer of dreams shall be put to death, because he hath spoken to you
 12323	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto Revolt from the Lord your God." In which words two things are to
 12324	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe observed, First, that God wil not have miracles alone serve for
 12325	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\targuments, to approve the Prophets calling; but (as it is in the third
 12326	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tverse) for an experiment of the constancy of our adherence to himself.
 12327	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor the works of the Egyptian Sorcerers, though not so great as those
 12328	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Moses, yet were great miracles. Secondly, that how great soever the
 12329	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmiracle be, yet if it tend to stir up revolt against the King, or him
 12330	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat governeth by the Kings authority, he that doth such miracle, is
 12331	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot to be considered otherwise than as sent to make triall of their
 12332	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tallegiance. For these words, "revolt from the Lord your God," are in
 12333	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis place equivalent to "revolt from your King." For they had made God
 12334	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir King by pact at the foot of Mount Sinai; who ruled them by Moses
 12335	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tonly; for he only spake with God, and from time to time declared Gods
 12336	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommandements to the people. In like manner, after our Saviour Christ
 12337	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thad made his Disciples acknowledge him for the Messiah, (that is to say,
 12338	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor Gods anointed, whom the nation of the Jews daily expected for their
 12339	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKing, but refused when he came,) he omitted not to advertise them of the
 12340	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdanger of miracles. "There shall arise," (saith he) "false Christs, and
 12341	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfalse Prophets, and shall doe great wonders and miracles, even to the
 12342	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tseducing (if it were possible) of the very Elect." (Mat. 24. 24) By
 12343	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich it appears, that false Prophets may have the power of miracles;
 12344	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tyet are wee not to take their doctrin for Gods Word. St. Paul says
 12345	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfurther to the Galatians, that "if himself, or an Angell from heaven
 12346	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpreach another Gospel to them, than he had preached, let him be
 12347	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\taccursed." (Gal. 1. 8) That Gospel was, that Christ was King; so that
 12348	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall preaching against the power of the King received, in consequence
 12349	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto these words, is by St. Paul accursed. For his speech is addressed to
 12350	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose, who by his preaching had already received Jesus for the Christ,
 12351	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat is to say, for King of the Jews.

 12356	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Marks Of A Prophet In The Old Law, Miracles, And Doctrine

 12358	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConformable To The Law
 12359	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12360	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd as Miracles, without preaching that Doctrine which God hath
 12361	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\testablished; so preaching the true Doctrine, without the doing of
 12362	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMiracles, is an unsufficient argument of immediate Revelation. For if
 12363	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta man that teacheth not false Doctrine, should pretend to bee a Prophet
 12364	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twithout shewing any Miracle, he is never the more to bee regarded for
 12365	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this pretence, as is evident by Deut. 18. v. 21, 22. "If thou say in
 12366	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthy heart, How shall we know that the Word (of the Prophet) is not that
 12367	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich the Lord hath spoken. When the Prophet shall have spoken in the
 12368	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tname of the Lord, that which shall not come to passe, that's the word
 12369	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich the Lord hath not spoken, but the Prophet has spoken it out of
 12370	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe pride of his own heart, fear him not." But a man may here again ask,
 12371	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhen the Prophet hath foretold a thing, how shal we know whether it will
 12372	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcome to passe or not? For he may foretel it as a thing to arrive after
 12373	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta certain long time, longer then the time of mans life; or indefinitely,
 12374	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat it will come to passe one time or other: in which case this mark
 12375	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof a Prophet is unusefull; and therefore the miracles that oblige us to
 12376	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeleeve a Prophet, ought to be confirmed by an immediate, or a not
 12377	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlong deferr'd event. So that it is manifest, that the teaching of
 12378	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Religion which God hath established, and the showing of a present
 12379	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMiracle, joined together, were the only marks whereby the Scripture
 12380	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twould have a true Prophet, that is to say immediate Revelation to be
 12381	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tacknowledged; neither of them being singly sufficient to oblige any
 12382	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother man to regard what he saith.

 12387	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMiracles Ceasing, Prophets Cease, The Scripture Supplies Their Place
 12388	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12389	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSeeing therefore Miracles now cease, we have no sign left, whereby to
 12390	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tacknowledge the pretended Revelations, or Inspirations of any private
 12391	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman; nor obligation to give ear to any Doctrine, farther than it is
 12392	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconformable to the Holy Scriptures, which since the time of our Saviour,
 12393	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsupply the want of all other Prophecy; and from which, by wise and
 12394	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcareful ratiocination, all rules and precepts necessary to the knowledge
 12395	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof our duty both to God and man, without Enthusiasme, or supernaturall
 12396	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInspiration, may easily be deduced. And this Scripture is it, out of
 12397	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich I am to take the Principles of my Discourse, concerning the
 12398	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRights of those that are the Supream Govenors on earth, of Christian
 12399	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealths; and of the duty of Christian Subjects towards their
 12400	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraigns. And to that end, I shall speak in the next Chapter, or the
 12401	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBooks, Writers, Scope and Authority of the Bible.

 12405	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCHAPTER XXXIII. OF THE NUMBER, ANTIQUITY, SCOPE, AUTHORITY,
 12406	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12407	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAND INTERPRETERS OF THE BOOKS OF HOLY SCRIPTURES

 12410	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12411	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12412	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf The Books Of Holy Scripture
 12413	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12414	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBy the Books of Holy SCRIPTURE, are understood those, which ought to be
 12415	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Canon, that is to say, the Rules of Christian life. And because all
 12416	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRules of life, which men are in conscience bound to observe, are Laws;
 12417	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe question of the Scripture, is the question of what is Law throughout
 12418	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall Christendome, both Naturall, and Civill. For though it be not
 12419	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdetermined in Scripture, what Laws every Christian King shall constitute
 12420	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin his own Dominions; yet it is determined what laws he shall not
 12421	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconstitute. Seeing therefore I have already proved, that Soveraigns
 12422	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin their own Dominions are the sole Legislators; those Books only are
 12423	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCanonicall, that is, Law, in every nation, which are established for
 12424	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch by the Soveraign Authority. It is true, that God is the Soveraign
 12425	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof all Soveraigns; and therefore, when he speaks to any Subject, he
 12426	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tought to be obeyed, whatsoever any earthly Potentate command to the
 12427	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontrary. But the question is not of obedience to God, but of When,
 12428	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand What God hath said; which to Subjects that have no supernaturall
 12429	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trevelation, cannot be known, but by that naturall reason, which guided
 12430	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem, for the obtaining of Peace and Justice, to obey the authority
 12431	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof their severall Common-wealths; that is to say, of their lawfull
 12432	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraigns. According to this obligation, I can acknowledge no other
 12433	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBooks of the Old Testament, to be Holy Scripture, but those which have
 12434	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeen commanded to be acknowledged for such, by the Authority of the
 12435	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChurch of England. What Books these are, is sufficiently known, without
 12436	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Catalogue of them here; and they are the same that are acknowledged
 12437	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby St. Jerome, who holdeth the rest, namely, the Wisdome of Solomon,
 12438	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEcclesiasticus, Judith, Tobias, the first and second of Maccabees,
 12439	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(though he had seen the first in Hebrew) and the third and fourth of
 12440	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEsdras, for Apocrypha. Of the Canonicall, Josephus a learned Jew, that
 12441	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twrote in the time of the Emperor Domitian, reckoneth Twenty Two, making
 12442	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe number agree with the Hebrew Alphabet. St. Jerome does the same,
 12443	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthough they reckon them in different manner. For Josephus numbers Five
 12444	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBooks of Moses, Thirteen of Prophets, that writ the History of their own
 12445	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttimes (which how it agrees with the Prophets writings contained in the
 12446	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBible wee shall see hereafter), and Four of Hymnes and Morall Precepts.
 12447	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut St. Jerome reckons Five Books of Moses, Eight of Prophets, and Nine
 12448	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof other Holy writ, which he calls of Hagiographa. The Septuagint, who
 12449	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere 70. learned men of the Jews, sent for by Ptolemy King of Egypt, to
 12450	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttranslate the Jewish Law, out of the Hebrew into the Greek, have left us
 12451	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tno other for holy Scripture in the Greek tongue, but the same that are
 12452	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treceived in the Church of England.
 12453	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12454	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAs for the Books of the New Testament, they are equally acknowledged for
 12455	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCanon by all Christian Churches, and by all sects of Christians, that
 12456	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tadmit any Books at all for Canonicall.

 12461	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTheir Antiquity
 12462	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12463	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWho were the originall writers of the severall Books of Holy Scripture,
 12464	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thas not been made evident by any sufficient testimony of other History,
 12465	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(which is the only proof of matter of fact); nor can be by any arguments
 12466	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof naturall Reason; for Reason serves only to convince the truth (not
 12467	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof fact, but) of consequence. The light therefore that must guide us in
 12468	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis question, must be that which is held out unto us from the Bookes
 12469	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthemselves: And this light, though it show us not the writer of every
 12470	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbook, yet it is not unusefull to give us knowledge of the time, wherein
 12471	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey were written.
 12472	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t

 12475	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12476	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Pentateuch Not Written By Moses
 12477	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12478	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd first, for the Pentateuch, it is not argument enough that they were
 12479	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twritten by Moses, because they are called the five Books of Moses; no
 12480	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmore than these titles, The Book of Joshua, the Book of Judges, The Book
 12481	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Ruth, and the Books of the Kings, are arguments sufficient to prove,
 12482	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat they were written by Joshua, by the Judges, by Ruth, and by the
 12483	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKings. For in titles of Books, the subject is marked, as often as the
 12484	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twriter. The History Of Livy, denotes the Writer; but the History Of
 12485	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tScanderbeg, is denominated from the subject. We read in the last Chapter
 12486	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Deuteronomie, Ver. 6. concerning the sepulcher of Moses, "that no man
 12487	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tknoweth of his sepulcher to this day," that is, to the day wherein those
 12488	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twords were written. It is therefore manifest, that those words were
 12489	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twritten after his interrement. For it were a strange interpretation, to
 12490	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsay Moses spake of his own sepulcher (though by Prophecy), that it was
 12491	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot found to that day, wherein he was yet living. But it may perhaps
 12492	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe alledged, that the last Chapter only, not the whole Pentateuch, was
 12493	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twritten by some other man, but the rest not: Let us therefore consider
 12494	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat which we find in the Book of Genesis, Chap. 12. Ver. 6 "And Abraham
 12495	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpassed through the land to the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh,
 12496	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand the Canaanite was then in the land;" which must needs bee the
 12497	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twords of one that wrote when the Canaanite was not in the land; and
 12498	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsequently, not of Moses, who dyed before he came into it. Likewise
 12499	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNumbers 21. Ver. 14. the Writer citeth another more ancient Book,
 12500	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEntituled, The Book of the Warres of the Lord, wherein were registred
 12501	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Acts of Moses, at the Red-sea, and at the brook of Arnon. It is
 12502	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore sufficiently evident, that the five Books of Moses were
 12503	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twritten after his time, though how long after it be not so manifest.
 12504	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12505	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut though Moses did not compile those Books entirely, and in the form
 12506	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twe have them; yet he wrote all that which hee is there said to have
 12507	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twritten: as for example, the Volume of the Law, which is contained, as
 12508	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit seemeth in the 11 of Deuteronomie, and the following Chapters to the
 12509	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t27. which was also commanded to be written on stones, in their entry
 12510	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinto the land of Canaan. (Deut. 31. 9) And this did Moses himself
 12511	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twrite, and deliver to the Priests and Elders of Israel, to be read
 12512	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevery seventh year to all Israel, at their assembling in the feast of
 12513	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTabernacles. And this is that Law which God commanded, that their Kings
 12514	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(when they should have established that form of Government) should take
 12515	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta copy of from the Priests and Levites to lay in the side of the Arke;
 12516	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(Deut. 31. 26) and the same which having been lost, was long time after
 12517	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfound again by Hilkiah, and sent to King Josias, who causing it to be
 12518	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tread to the People, renewed the Covenant between God and them. (2 King.
 12519	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t22. 8 & 23. 1,2,3)

 12524	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Book of Joshua Written After His Time
 12525	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12526	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThat the Book of Joshua was also written long after the time of Joshua,
 12527	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmay be gathered out of many places of the Book it self. Joshua had
 12528	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tset up twelve stones in the middest of Jordan, for a monument of their
 12529	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpassage; (Josh 4. 9) of which the Writer saith thus, "They are there
 12530	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunto this day;" (Josh 5. 9) for "unto this day", is a phrase that
 12531	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsignifieth a time past, beyond the memory of man. In like manner, upon
 12532	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe saying of the Lord, that he had rolled off from the people the
 12533	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tReproach of Egypt, the Writer saith, "The place is called Gilgal unto
 12534	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis day;" which to have said in the time of Joshua had been improper.
 12535	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSo also the name of the Valley of Achor, from the trouble that Achan
 12536	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\traised in the Camp, (Josh. 7. 26) the Writer saith, "remaineth unto
 12537	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis day;" which must needs bee therefore long after the time of Joshua.
 12538	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tArguments of this kind there be many other; as Josh. 8. 29. 13. 13. 14.

 12545	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12546	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe same is manifest by like arguments of the Book of Judges, chap. 1.
 12547	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t21,26 6.24 10.4 15.19 17.6 and Ruth 1. 1. but especially Judg. 18. 30.

 12556	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThat the Books of Samuel were also written after his own time, there
 12557	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare the like arguments, 1 Sam. 5.5. 7.13,15. 27.6. & 30.25. where, after
 12558	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDavid had adjudged equall part of the spoiles, to them that guarded
 12559	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Ammunition, with them that fought, the Writer saith, "He made it a
 12560	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tStatute and an Ordinance to Israel to this day." (2. Sam. 6.4.) Again,
 12561	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhen David (displeased, that the Lord had slain Uzzah, for putting out
 12562	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this hand to sustain the Ark,) called the place Perez-Uzzah, the Writer
 12563	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsaith, it is called so "to this day": the time therefore of the writing
 12564	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof that Book, must be long after the time of the fact; that is, long
 12565	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tafter the time of David.

 12571	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12572	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAs for the two Books of the Kings, and the two books of the Chronicles,
 12573	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbesides the places which mention such monuments, as the Writer saith,
 12574	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tremained till his own days; such as are 1 Kings 9.13. 9.21. 10. 12.

 12576	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChron. 4.41. 5.26. It is argument sufficient they were written after the
 12577	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcaptivity in Babylon, that the History of them is continued till that
 12578	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttime. For the Facts Registred are alwaies more ancient than such Books
 12579	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas make mention of, and quote the Register; as these Books doe in divers
 12580	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tplaces, referring the Reader to the Chronicles of the Kings of Juda,
 12581	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel, to the Books of the Prophet
 12582	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSamuel, or the Prophet Nathan, of the Prophet Ahijah; to the Vision of

 12590	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Books of Esdras and Nehemiah were written certainly after their
 12591	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treturn from captivity; because their return, the re-edification of

 12609	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand though it appear sufficiently (Exekiel 14.14, and James 5.11.)
 12610	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat he was no fained person; yet the Book it self seemeth not to be
 12611	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta History, but a Treatise concerning a question in ancient time much
 12612	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdisputed, "why wicked men have often prospered in this world, and good
 12613	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen have been afflicted;" and it is the most probably, because from the
 12614	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeginning, to the third verse of the third chapter, where the complaint
 12615	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Job beginneth, the Hebrew is (as St. Jerome testifies) in prose; and
 12616	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom thence to the sixt verse of the last chapter in Hexameter Verses;
 12617	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand the rest of that chapter again in prose. So that the dispute is all
 12618	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin verse; and the prose is added, but as a Preface in the beginning, and
 12619	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tan Epilogue in the end. But Verse is no usuall stile of such, as either
 12620	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare themselves in great pain, as Job; or of such as come to comfort
 12621	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem, as his friends; but in Philosophy, especially morall Philosophy,

 12631	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsome of them after the return from the Captivity; as the 137. and the
 12632	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t126. whereby it is manifest that the Psalter was compiled, and put into

 12644	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe sentences be theirs, yet the collection or compiling them into this

 12667	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIsaiah and Michaiah, who lived in the time of Amaziah, and Azariah,
 12668	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\totherwise Ozias, Kings of Judah. But the Book of Jonas is not properly
 12669	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Register of his Prophecy, (for that is contained in these few words,
 12670	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"Fourty dayes and Ninivy shall be destroyed,") but a History or Narration
 12671	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof his frowardenesse and disputing Gods commandements; so that there is
 12672	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsmall probability he should be the Author, seeing he is the subject of

 12678	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12679	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhen Joel and Malachi prophecyed, is not evident by their Writings. But
 12680	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsidering the Inscriptions, or Titles of their Books, it is manifest
 12681	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tenough, that the whole Scripture of the Old Testament, was set forth in
 12682	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe form we have it, after the return of the Jews from their Captivity
 12683	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin Babylon, and before the time of Ptolemaeus Philadelphus, that caused
 12684	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit to bee translated into Greek by seventy men, which were sent him
 12685	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tout of Judea for that purpose. And if the Books of Apocrypha (which
 12686	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare recommended to us by the Church, though not for Canonicall, yet for
 12687	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprofitable Books for our instruction) may in this point be credited, the
 12688	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tScripture was set forth in the form wee have it in, by Esdras; as may
 12689	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tappear by that which he himself saith, in the second book, chapt. 14.
 12690	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tverse 21, 22, &c. where speaking to God, he saith thus, "Thy law is
 12691	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tburnt; therefore no man knoweth the things which thou has done, or the
 12692	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tworks that are to begin. But if I have found Grace before thee, send
 12693	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdown the holy Spirit into me, and I shall write all that hath been done
 12694	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the world, since the beginning, which were written in thy Law, that
 12695	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen may find thy path, and that they which will live in the later days,
 12696	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmay live." And verse 45. "And it came to passe when the forty dayes were
 12697	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfulfilled, that the Highest spake, saying, 'The first that thou hast
 12698	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twritten, publish openly, that the worthy and unworthy may read it; but
 12699	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tkeep the seventy last, that thou mayst deliver them onely to such as
 12700	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe wise among the people.'" And thus much concerning the time of the

 12710	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDisciples, except St. Paul, and St. Luke; and consequently whatsoever

 12717	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe copies were not many, nor could easily be all in any one private
 12718	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmans hand, cannot bee derived from a higher time, that that wherein the
 12719	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGovernours of the Church collected, approved, and recommended them to
 12720	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tus, as the writings of those Apostles and Disciples; under whose names
 12721	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey go. The first enumeration of all the Bookes, both of the Old,
 12722	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand New Testament, is in the Canons of the Apostles, supposed to be
 12723	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcollected by Clement the first (after St. Peter) Bishop of Rome. But
 12724	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbecause that is but supposed, and by many questioned, the Councell of
 12725	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaodicea is the first we know, that recommended the Bible to the then
 12726	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChristian Churches, for the Writings of the Prophets and Apostles: and
 12727	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis Councell was held in the 364. yeer after Christ. At which time,
 12728	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthough ambition had so far prevailed on the great Doctors of the Church,
 12729	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas no more to esteem Emperours, though Christian, for the Shepherds of
 12730	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe people, but for Sheep; and Emperours not Christian, for Wolves; and
 12731	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tendeavoured to passe their Doctrine, not for Counsell, and Information,
 12732	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas Preachers; but for Laws, as absolute Governours; and thought such
 12733	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrauds as tended to make the people the more obedient to Christian
 12734	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDoctrine, to be pious; yet I am perswaded they did not therefore
 12735	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfalsifie the Scriptures, though the copies of the Books of the New
 12736	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTestament, were in the hands only of the Ecclesiasticks; because if they
 12737	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thad had an intention so to doe, they would surely have made them more
 12738	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfavorable to their power over Christian Princes, and Civill Soveraignty,
 12739	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthan they are. I see not therefore any reason to doubt, but that the
 12740	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOld, and New Testament, as we have them now, are the true Registers of
 12741	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose things, which were done and said by the Prophets, and Apostles.
 12742	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd so perhaps are some of those Books which are called Apocrypha, if
 12743	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tleft out of the Canon, not for inconformity of Doctrine with the
 12744	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trest, but only because they are not found in the Hebrew. For after the
 12745	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconquest of Asia by Alexander the Great, there were few learned Jews,
 12746	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat were not perfect in the Greek tongue. For the seventy Interpreters
 12747	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat converted the Bible into Greek, were all of them Hebrews; and we
 12748	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave extant the works of Philo and Josephus both Jews, written by them
 12749	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teloquently in Greek. But it is not the Writer, but the authority of the
 12750	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChurch, that maketh a Book Canonicall.

 12755	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTheir Scope
 12756	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12757	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd although these Books were written by divers men, yet it is manifest
 12758	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Writers were all indued with one and the same Spirit, in that they
 12759	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconspire to one and the same end, which is the setting forth of the
 12760	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRights of the Kingdome of God, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. For
 12761	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Book of Genesis, deriveth the Genealogy of Gods people, from the
 12762	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcreation of the World, to the going into Egypt: the other four Books of
 12763	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMoses, contain the Election of God for their King, and the Laws which
 12764	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thee prescribed for their Government: The Books of Joshua, Judges, Ruth,
 12765	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Samuel, to the time of Saul, describe the acts of Gods people,
 12766	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttill the time they cast off Gods yoke, and called for a King, after the
 12767	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmanner of their neighbour nations; The rest of the History of the
 12768	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOld Testament, derives the succession of the line of David, to the
 12769	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCaptivity, out of which line was to spring the restorer of the Kingdome
 12770	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof God, even our blessed Saviour God the Son, whose coming was foretold
 12771	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the Bookes of the Prophets, after whom the Evangelists writt his
 12772	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlife, and actions, and his claim to the Kingdome, whilst he lived one
 12773	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tearth: and lastly, the Acts, and Epistles of the Apostles, declare the
 12774	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcoming of God, the Holy Ghost, and the Authority he left with them, and
 12775	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir successors, for the direction of the Jews, and for the invitation
 12776	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Gentiles. In summe, the Histories and the Prophecies of the old
 12777	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTestament, and the Gospels, and Epistles of the New Testament, have had
 12778	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tone and the same scope, to convert men to the obedience of God; 1. in
 12779	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMoses, and the Priests; 2. in the man Christ; and 3. in the Apostles and
 12780	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe successors to Apostolicall power. For these three at several times
 12781	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdid represent the person of God: Moses, and his successors the High
 12782	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPriests, and Kings of Judah, in the Old Testament: Christ himself, in
 12783	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe time he lived on earth: and the Apostles, and their successors, from
 12784	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe day of Pentecost (when the Holy Ghost descended on them) to this
 12785	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tday.

 12789	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12790	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Question Of The Authority Of The Scriptures Stated.
 12791	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12792	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIt is a question much disputed between the divers sects of Christian
 12793	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tReligion, From Whence The Scriptures Derive Their Authority; which
 12794	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tquestion is also propounded sometimes in other terms, as, How Wee Know
 12795	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThem To Be The Word Of God, or, Why We Beleeve Them To Be So: and the
 12796	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdifficulty of resolving it, ariseth chiefly from the impropernesse of
 12797	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe words wherein the question it self is couched. For it is beleeved
 12798	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ton all hands, that the first and originall Author of them is God; and
 12799	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsequently the question disputed, is not that. Again, it is manifest,
 12800	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat none can know they are Gods Word, (though all true Christians
 12801	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeleeve it,) but those to whom God himself hath revealed it
 12802	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsupernaturally; and therefore the question is not rightly moved, of our
 12803	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKnowledge of it. Lastly, when the question is propounded of our Beleefe;
 12804	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbecause some are moved to beleeve for one, and others for other reasons,
 12805	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere can be rendred no one generall answer for them all. The question
 12806	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttruly stated is, By What Authority They Are Made Law.
 12807	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12808	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12809	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12810	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12811	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTheir Authority And Interpretation
 12812	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12813	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAs far as they differ not from the Laws of Nature, there is no doubt,
 12814	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut they are the Law of God, and carry their Authority with them,
 12815	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlegible to all men that have the use of naturall reason: but this is
 12816	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tno other Authority, then that of all other Morall Doctrine consonant to
 12817	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tReason; the Dictates whereof are Laws, not Made, but Eternall.
 12818	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12819	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIf they be made Law by God himselfe, they are of the nature of written
 12820	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaw, which are Laws to them only to whom God hath so sufficiently
 12821	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpublished them, as no man can excuse himself, by saying, he know not
 12822	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey were his.
 12823	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12824	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHe therefore, to whom God hath not supernaturally revealed, that they
 12825	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare his, nor that those that published them, were sent by him, is not
 12826	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobliged to obey them, by any Authority, but his, whose Commands have
 12827	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talready the force of Laws; that is to say, by any other Authority, then
 12828	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat of the Common-wealth, residing in the Soveraign, who only has the
 12829	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLegislative power. Again, if it be not the Legislative Authority of
 12830	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Common-wealth, that giveth them the force of Laws, it must bee
 12831	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsome other Authority derived from God, either private, or publique:
 12832	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tif private, it obliges onely him, to whom in particular God hath been
 12833	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpleased to reveale it. For if every man should be obliged, to take for
 12834	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGods Law, what particular men, on pretence of private Inspiration, or
 12835	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRevelation, should obtrude upon him, (in such a number of men, that out
 12836	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof pride, and ignorance, take their own Dreams, and extravagant Fancies,
 12837	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Madnesse, for testimonies of Gods Spirit; or out of ambition,
 12838	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpretend to such Divine testimonies, falsely, and contrary to their
 12839	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\town consciences,) it were impossible that any Divine Law should be
 12840	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tacknowledged. If publique, it is the Authority of the Common-wealth, or
 12841	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Church. But the Church, if it be one person, is the same thing
 12842	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith a Common-wealth of Christians; called a Common-wealth, because it
 12843	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsisteth of men united in one person, their Soveraign; and a Church,
 12844	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbecause it consisteth in Christian men, united in one Christian
 12845	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign. But if the Church be not one person, then it hath no
 12846	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tauthority at all; it can neither command, nor doe any action at all; nor
 12847	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis capable of having any power, or right to any thing; nor has any Will,
 12848	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tReason, nor Voice; for all these qualities are personall. Now if the
 12849	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhole number of Christians be not contained in one Common-wealth, they
 12850	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare not one person; nor is there an Universall Church that hath any
 12851	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tauthority over them; and therefore the Scriptures are not made Laws,
 12852	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby the Universall Church: or if it bee one Common-wealth, then all
 12853	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChristian Monarchs, and States are private persons, and subject to
 12854	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbee judged, deposed, and punished by an Universall Soveraigne of all
 12855	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChristendome. So that the question of the Authority of the Scriptures is
 12856	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treduced to this, "Whether Christian Kings, and the Soveraigne Assemblies
 12857	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin Christian Common-wealths, be absolute in their own Territories,
 12858	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\timmediately under God; or subject to one Vicar of Christ, constituted
 12859	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tover the Universall Church; to bee judged, condemned, deposed, and put
 12860	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto death, as hee shall think expedient, or necessary for the common
 12861	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgood."
 12862	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12863	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhich question cannot bee resolved, without a more particular
 12864	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsideration of the Kingdome of God; from whence also, wee are to judge
 12865	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Authority of Interpreting the Scripture. For, whosoever hath a
 12866	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlawfull power over any Writing, to make it Law, hath the power also to
 12867	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tapprove, or disapprove the interpretation of the same.

 12878	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12879	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSeeing the foundation of all true Ratiocination, is the constant
 12880	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSignification of words; which in the Doctrine following, dependeth not
 12881	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(as in naturall science) on the Will of the Writer, nor (as in common
 12882	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconversation) on vulgar use, but on the sense they carry in the
 12883	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tScripture; It is necessary, before I proceed any further, to determine,
 12884	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tout of the Bible, the meaning of such words, as by their ambiguity, may
 12885	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trender what I am to inferre upon them, obscure, or disputable. I will
 12886	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbegin with the words BODY, and SPIRIT, which in the language of the
 12887	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSchools are termed, Substances, Corporeall, and Incorporeall.
 12888	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12889	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Word Body, in the most generall acceptation, signifieth that
 12890	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich filleth, or occupyeth some certain room, or imagined place; and
 12891	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdependeth not on the imagination, but is a reall part of that we call
 12892	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Universe. For the Universe, being the Aggregate of all Bodies, there
 12893	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis no reall part thereof that is not also Body; nor any thing properly
 12894	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Body, that is not also part of (that Aggregate of all Bodies) the
 12895	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tUniverse. The same also, because Bodies are subject to change, that is
 12896	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto say, to variety of apparence to the sense of living creatures, is
 12897	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcalled Substance, that is to say, Subject, to various accidents, as
 12898	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsometimes to be Moved, sometimes to stand Still; and to seem to our
 12899	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsenses sometimes Hot, sometimes Cold, sometimes of one Colour, Smel,
 12900	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTast, or Sound, somtimes of another. And this diversity of Seeming,
 12901	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(produced by the diversity of the operation of bodies, on the organs
 12902	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof our sense) we attribute to alterations of the Bodies that operate, &
 12903	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcall them Accidents of those Bodies. And according to this acceptation
 12904	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the word, Substance and Body, signifie the same thing; and therefore
 12905	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSubstance Incorporeall are words, which when they are joined together,
 12906	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdestroy one another, as if a man should say, an Incorporeall Body.
 12907	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12908	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut in the sense of common people, not all the Universe is called Body,
 12909	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut only such parts thereof as they can discern by the sense of Feeling,
 12910	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto resist their force, or by the sense of their Eyes, to hinder them
 12911	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom a farther prospect. Therefore in the common language of men, Aire,
 12912	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Aeriall Substances, use not to be taken for Bodies, but (as often
 12913	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas men are sensible of their effects) are called Wind, or Breath, or
 12914	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(because the some are called in the Latine Spiritus) Spirits; as when
 12915	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey call that aeriall substance, which in the body of any living
 12916	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcreature, gives it life and motion, Vitall and Animall Spirits. But for
 12917	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose Idols of the brain, which represent Bodies to us, where they
 12918	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare not, as in a Looking-glasse, in a Dream, or to a Distempered brain
 12919	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twaking, they are (as the Apostle saith generally of all Idols) nothing;
 12920	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNothing at all, I say, there where they seem to bee; and in the brain
 12921	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit self, nothing but tumult, proceeding either from the action of the
 12922	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobjects, or from the disorderly agitation of the Organs of our Sense.
 12923	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd men, that are otherwise imployed, then to search into their causes,
 12924	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tknow not of themselves, what to call them; and may therefore easily be
 12925	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tperswaded, by those whose knowledge they much reverence, some to
 12926	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcall them Bodies, and think them made of aire compacted by a power
 12927	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsupernaturall, because the sight judges them corporeall; and some to
 12928	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcall them Spirits, because the sense of Touch discerneth nothing in the
 12929	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tplace where they appear, to resist their fingers: So that the proper
 12930	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsignification of Spirit in common speech, is either a subtile, fluid,
 12931	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand invisible Body, or a Ghost, or other Idol or Phantasme of the
 12932	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tImagination. But for metaphoricall significations, there be many: for
 12933	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsometimes it is taken for Disposition or Inclination of the mind; as
 12934	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhen for the disposition to controwl the sayings of other men, we say,
 12935	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tA Spirit Contradiction; For A Disposition to Uncleannesse, An Unclean
 12936	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSpirit; for Perversenesse, A Froward Spirit; for Sullennesse, A Dumb
 12937	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSpirit, and for Inclination To Godlinesse, And Gods Service, the Spirit
 12938	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof God: sometimes for any eminent ability, or extraordinary passion,
 12939	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor disease of the mind, as when Great Wisdome is called the Spirit Of
 12940	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWisdome; and Mad Men are said to be Possessed With A Spirit.
 12941	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12942	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOther signification of Spirit I find no where any; and where none
 12943	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof these can satisfie the sense of that word in Scripture, the place
 12944	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfalleth not under humane Understanding; and our Faith therein consisteth
 12945	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot in our Opinion, but in our Submission; as in all places where God
 12946	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis said to be a Spirit; or where by the Spirit of God, is meant God
 12947	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thimselfe. For the nature of God is incomprehensible; that is to say, we
 12948	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunderstand nothing of What He Is, but only That He Is; and therefore the
 12949	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAttributes we give him, are not to tell one another, What He Is, Nor
 12950	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto signifie our opinion of his Nature, but our desire to honor him with
 12951	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch names as we conceive most honorable amongst our selves.

 12959	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tif by the Spirit of God be meant God himself, then is Motion attributed
 12960	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto God, and consequently Place, which are intelligible only of Bodies,
 12961	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand not of substances incorporeall; and so the place is above our
 12962	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunderstanding, that can conceive nothing moved that changes not place,
 12963	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor that has not dimension; and whatsoever has dimension, is Body. But
 12964	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe meaning of those words is best understood by the like place, Gen.

 12966	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod intending to abate them, and again to discover the dry land, useth
 12967	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlike words, "I will bring my Spirit upon the Earth, and the waters shall
 12968	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe diminished:" in which place by Spirit is understood a Wind, (that is
 12969	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tan Aire or Spirit Moved,) which might be called (as in the former place)
 12970	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Spirit of God, because it was Gods Work.

 12975	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSecondly, For Extraordinary Gifts Of The Understanding
 12976	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12977	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGen. 41. 38. Pharaoh calleth the Wisdome of Joseph, the Spirit of God.
 12978	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor Joseph having advised him to look out a wise and discreet man, and
 12979	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto set him over the land of Egypt, he saith thus, "Can we find such a
 12980	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman as this is, in whom is the Spirit of God?" and Exod. 28.3. "Thou
 12981	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshalt speak (saith God) to all that are wise hearted, whom I have filled
 12982	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith the Spirit of Wisdome, to make Aaron Garments, to consecrate him."
 12983	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhere extraordinary Understanding, though but in making Garments, as
 12984	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeing the Gift of God, is called the Spirit of God. The same is found
 12985	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagain, Exod. 31.3,4,5,6. and 35.31. And Isaiah 11.2,3. where the Prophet
 12986	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tspeaking of the Messiah, saith, "The Spirit of the Lord shall abide upon
 12987	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim, the Spirit of wisdome and understanding, the Spirit of counsell,
 12988	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand fortitude; and the Spirit of the fear of the Lord." Where manifestly
 12989	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis meant, not so many Ghosts, but so many eminent Graces that God would
 12990	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgive him.
 12991	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12992	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12993	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12994	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12995	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThirdly, For Extraordinary Affections
 12996	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 12997	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn the Book of Judges, an extraordinary Zeal, and Courage in the
 12998	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdefence of Gods people, is called the Spirit of God; as when it excited
 12999	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOthoniel, Gideon, Jeptha, and Samson to deliver them from servitude,
 13000	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJudg. 3.10. 6.34. 11.29. 13.25. 14.6,19. And of Saul, upon the newes of
 13001	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe insolence of the Ammonites towards the men of Jabeth Gilead, it is
 13002	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsaid (1 Sam.11.6.) that "The Spirit of God came upon Saul, and his Anger
 13003	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(or, as it is in the Latine, His Fury) was kindled greatly." Where it is
 13004	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot probable was meant a Ghost, but an extraordinary Zeal to punish the
 13005	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcruelty of the Ammonites. In like manner by the Spirit of God, that came
 13006	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tupon Saul, when hee was amongst the Prophets that praised God in Songs,
 13007	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Musick (1 Sam.19.20.) is to be understood, not a Ghost, but an
 13008	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunexpected and sudden Zeal to join with them in their devotions.
 13009	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13010	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13011	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13012	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13013	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFourthly, For The Gift Of Prediction By Dreams And Visions
 13014	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13015	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe false Prophet Zedekiah, saith to Micaiah (1 Kings 22.24.) "Which way
 13016	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twent the Spirit of the Lord from me to speak to thee?" Which cannot be
 13017	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunderstood of a Ghost; for Micaiah declared before the Kings of Israel
 13018	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Judah, the event of the battle, as from a Vision, and not as from a
 13019	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSpirit, speaking in him.
 13020	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13021	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn the same manner it appeareth, in the Books of the Prophets, that
 13022	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthough they spake by the Spirit of God, that is to say, by a speciall
 13023	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgrace of Prediction; yet their knowledge of the future, was not by a
 13024	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGhost within them, but by some supernaturall Dream or Vision.
 13025	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13026	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13027	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13028	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13029	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFiftly, For Life
 13030	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13031	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGen. 2.7. It is said, "God made man of the dust of the Earth, and
 13032	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbreathed into his nostrills (spiraculum vitae) the breath of life, and
 13033	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman was made a living soul." There the Breath of Life inspired by God,
 13034	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsignifies no more, but that God gave him life; And (Job 27.3.) "as long
 13035	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas the Spirit of God is in my nostrils;" is no more then to say, "as
 13036	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlong as I live." So in Ezek. 1.20. "the Spirit of life was in the
 13037	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twheels," is equivalent to, "the wheels were alive." And (Ezek. 2.30.)
 13038	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"the spirit entred into me, and set me on my feet," that is, "I
 13039	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trecovered my vitall strength;" not that any Ghost, or incorporeal
 13040	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsubstance entred into, and possessed his body.
 13041	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13042	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13043	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13044	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13045	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSixtly, For A Subordination To Authority
 13046	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13047	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn the 11 chap. of Numbers. verse 17. "I will take (saith God) of the
 13048	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSpirit, which is upon thee, and will put it upon them, and they shall
 13049	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbear the burthen of the people with thee;" that is, upon the seventy
 13050	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tElders: whereupon two of the seventy are said to prophecy in the campe;
 13051	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof whom some complained, and Joshua desired Moses to forbid them; which
 13052	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMoses would not doe. Whereby it appears; that Joshua knew not they had
 13053	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treceived authority so to do, and prophecyed according to the mind of
 13054	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMoses, that is to say, by a Spirit, or Authority subordinate to his own.
 13055	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13056	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn the like sense we read (Deut. 34.9.) that "Joshua was full of the
 13057	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSpirit of wisdome," because Moses had laid his hands upon him: that is,
 13058	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbecause he was Ordained by Moses, to prosecute the work hee had himselfe
 13059	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbegun, (namely, the bringing of Gods people into the promised land), but
 13060	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprevented by death, could not finish.
 13061	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13062	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn the like sense it is said, (Rom. 8.9.) "If any man have not the
 13063	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSpirit of Christ, he is none of his:" not meaning thereby the Ghost of
 13064	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChrist, but a Submission to his Doctrine. As also (1 John 4.2.) "Hereby
 13065	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tyou shall know the Spirit of God; Every Spirit that confesseth that
 13066	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJesus Christ is come in the flesh, is of God;" by which is meant the
 13067	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSpirit of unfained Christianity, or Submission to that main Article of
 13068	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChristian faith, that Jesus is the Christ; which cannot be interpreted
 13069	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof a Ghost.
 13070	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13071	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLikewise these words (Luke 4.1.) "And Jesus full of the Holy Ghost"
 13072	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(that is, as it is exprest, Mat. 4.1. and Mar. 1.12. "of the Holy
 13073	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSpirit",) may be understood, for Zeal to doe the work for which hee was
 13074	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsent by God the Father: but to interpret it of a Ghost, is to say, that
 13075	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod himselfe (for so our Saviour was,) was filled with God; which is
 13076	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tvery unproper, and unsignificant. How we came to translate Spirits, by
 13077	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe word Ghosts, which signifieth nothing, neither in heaven, nor earth,
 13078	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut the Imaginary inhabitants of mans brain, I examine not: but this I
 13079	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsay, the word Spirit in the text signifieth no such thing; but either
 13080	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tproperly a reall Substance, or Metaphorically, some extraordinary
 13081	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAbility of Affection of the Mind, or of the Body.
 13082	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13083	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13084	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13085	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13086	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSeventhly, For Aeriall Bodies
 13087	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13088	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Disciples of Christ, seeing him walking upon the sea, (Mat. 14.26.
 13089	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Marke 6.49.) supposed him to be a Spirit, meaning thereby an Aeriall
 13090	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBody, and not a Phantasme: for it is said, they all saw him; which
 13091	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcannot be understood of the delusions of the brain, (which are not
 13092	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommon to many at once, as visible Bodies are; but singular, because of
 13093	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe differences of Fancies), but of Bodies only. In like manner, where
 13094	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the was taken for a Spirit, by the same Apostles (Luke 24.3,7.): So also
 13095	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(Acts 12.15) when St. Peter was delivered out of Prison, it would not
 13096	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe beleeved; but when the Maid said he was at the dore, they said it
 13097	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas his Angel; by which must be meant a corporeall substance, or we must
 13098	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsay, the Disciples themselves did follow the common opinion of both Jews
 13099	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Gentiles, that some such apparitions were not Imaginary, but Reall;
 13100	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand such as needed not the fancy of man for their Existence: These the
 13101	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJews called Spirits, and Angels, Good or Bad; as the Greeks called the
 13102	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsame by the name of Daemons. And some such apparitions may be reall, and
 13103	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsubstantiall; that is to say, subtile Bodies, which God can form by
 13104	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe same power, by which he formed all things, and make use of, as of
 13105	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMinisters, and Messengers (that is to say, Angels) to declare his
 13106	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twill, and execute the same when he pleaseth, in extraordinary and
 13107	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsupernaturall manner. But when hee hath so formed them they are
 13108	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSubstances, endued with dimensions, and take up roome, and can be moved
 13109	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom place to place, which is peculiar to Bodies; and therefore are not
 13110	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGhosts Incorporeall, that is to say, Ghosts that are in No Place;
 13111	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat is to say, that are No Where; that is to say, that seeming to be
 13112	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSomewhat, are Nothing. But if corporeall be taken in the most vulgar
 13113	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmanner, for such Substances as are perceptible by our externall Senses;
 13114	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthen is Substance Incorporeall, a thing not Imaginary, but Reall;
 13115	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnamely, a thin Substance Invisible, but that hath the same dimensions
 13116	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat are in grosser Bodies.
 13117	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13118	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13119	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13120	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13121	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAngel What
 13122	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13123	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBy the name of ANGEL, is signified generally, a Messenger; and most
 13124	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\toften, a Messenger of God: And by a Messenger of God, is signified, any
 13125	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthing that makes known his extraordinary Presence; that is to say, the
 13126	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\textraordinary manifestation of his power, especially by a Dream, or
 13127	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tVision.
 13128	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13129	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConcerning the creation of Angels, there is nothing delivered in the
 13130	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tScriptures. That they are Spirits, is often repeated: but by the name of
 13131	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSpirit, is signified both in Scripture, and vulgarly, both amongst Jews,
 13132	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Gentiles, sometimes thin Bodies; as the Aire, the Wind, the Spirits
 13133	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tVitall, and Animall, of living creatures; and sometimes the Images
 13134	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat rise in the fancy in Dreams, and Visions; which are not reall
 13135	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSubstances, but accidents of the brain; yet when God raiseth them
 13136	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsupernaturally, to signifie his Will, they are not unproperly termed
 13137	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGods Messengers, that is to say, his Angels.
 13138	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13139	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd as the Gentiles did vulgarly conceive the Imagery of the brain, for
 13140	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthings really subsistent without them, and not dependent on the fancy;
 13141	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand out of them framed their opinions of Daemons, Good and Evill; which
 13142	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbecause they seemed to subsist really, they called Substances; and
 13143	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbecause they could not feel them with their hands, Incorporeall: so also
 13144	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Jews upon the same ground, without any thing in the Old Testament
 13145	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat constrained them thereunto, had generally an opinion, (except the
 13146	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsect of the Sadduces,) that those apparitions (which it pleased God
 13147	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsometimes to produce in the fancie of men, for his own service, and
 13148	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore called them his Angels) were substances, not dependent on the
 13149	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfancy, but permanent creatures of God; whereof those which they thought
 13150	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere good to them, they esteemed the Angels of God, and those they
 13151	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthought would hurt them, they called Evill Angels, or Evill Spirits;
 13152	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch as was the Spirit of Python, and the Spirits of Mad-men, of
 13153	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLunatiques, and Epileptiques: For they esteemed such as were troubled
 13154	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith such diseases, Daemoniaques.
 13155	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13156	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut if we consider the places of the Old Testament where Angels are
 13157	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmentioned, we shall find, that in most of them, there can nothing else
 13158	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe understood by the word Angel, but some image raised (supernaturally)
 13159	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the fancy, to signifie the presence of God in the execution of some
 13160	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsupernaturall work; and therefore in the rest, where their nature is not
 13161	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texprest, it may be understood in the same manner.
 13162	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13163	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor we read Gen. 16. that the same apparition is called, not onely an
 13164	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAngel, but God; where that which (verse 7.) is called the Angel of
 13165	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Lord, in the tenth verse, saith to Agar, "I will multiply thy seed
 13166	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texceedingly;" that is, speaketh in the person of God. Neither was this
 13167	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tapparition a Fancy figured, but a Voice. By which it is manifest,
 13168	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat Angel signifieth there, nothing but God himself, that caused Agar
 13169	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsupernaturally to apprehend a voice supernaturall, testifying Gods
 13170	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tspeciall presence there. Why therefore may not the Angels that appeared
 13171	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto Lot, and are called Gen. 19.13. Men; and to whom, though they were
 13172	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut two, Lot speaketh (ver. 18.) as but one, and that one, as God, (for
 13173	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe words are, "Lot said unto them, Oh not so my Lord") be understood of
 13174	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\timages of men, supernaturally formed in the Fancy; as well as before by
 13175	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAngel was understood a fancyed Voice? When the Angel called to Abraham
 13176	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tout of heaven, to stay his hand (Gen. 22.11.) from slaying Isaac, there
 13177	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas no Apparition, but a Voice; which neverthelesse was called properly
 13178	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tenough a Messenger, or Angel of God, because it declared Gods will
 13179	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsupernaturally, and saves the labour of supposing any permanent Ghosts.
 13180	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Angels which Jacob saw on the Ladder of Heaven (Gen. 28.12.) were
 13181	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Vision of his sleep; therefore onely Fancy, and a Dream; yet being
 13182	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsupernaturall, and signs of Gods Speciall presence, those apparitions
 13183	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare not improperly called Angels. The same is to be understood
 13184	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(Gen.31.11.) where Jacob saith thus, "The Angel of the Lord appeared to
 13185	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmee in my sleep." For an apparition made to a man in his sleep, is
 13186	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat which all men call a Dreame, whether such Dreame be naturall, or
 13187	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsupernaturall: and that which there Jacob calleth an Angel, was God
 13188	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thimselfe; for the same Angel saith (verse 13.) "I am the God of Bethel."
 13189	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13190	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAlso (Exod.14.9.) the Angel that went before the Army of Israel to the
 13191	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRed Sea, and then came behind it, is (verse 19.) the Lord himself; and
 13192	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the appeared not in the form of a beautifull man, but in form (by day)
 13193	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof a Pillar Of Cloud and (by night) in form of a Pillar Of Fire; and yet
 13194	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis Pillar was all the apparition, and Angel promised to Moses (Exod.
 13195	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t14.9.) for the Armies guide: For this cloudy pillar, is said, to have
 13196	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdescended, and stood at the dore of the Tabernacle, and to have talked
 13197	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith Moses.
 13198	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13199	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThere you see Motion, and Speech, which are commonly attributed to
 13200	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAngels, attributed to a Cloud, because the Cloud served as a sign of
 13201	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGods presence; and was no lesse an Angel, then if it had had the form of
 13202	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Man, or Child of never so great beauty; or Wings, as usually they are
 13203	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpainted, for the false instruction of common people. For it is not the
 13204	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshape; but their use, that makes them Angels. But their use is to be
 13205	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsignifications of Gods presence in supernaturall operations; As when
 13206	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMoses (Exod. 33.14.) had desired God to goe along with the Campe, (as
 13207	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the had done alwaies before the making of the Golden Calfe,) God did not
 13208	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tanswer, "I will goe," nor "I will send an Angel in my stead;" but thus,
 13209	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"my presence shall goe with thee."
 13210	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13211	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo mention all the places of the Old Testament where the name of Angel
 13212	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis found, would be too long. Therefore to comprehend them all at once,
 13213	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tI say, there is no text in that part of the Old Testament, which the
 13214	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChurch of England holdeth for Canonicall, from which we can conclude,
 13215	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere is, or hath been created, any permanent thing (understood by the
 13216	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tname of Spirit or Angel,) that hath not quantity; and that may not be,
 13217	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby the understanding divided; that is to say, considered by parts; so
 13218	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas one part may bee in one place, and the next part in the next place
 13219	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto it; and, in summe, which is not (taking Body for that, which is some
 13220	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhat, or some where) Corporeall; but in every place, the sense will bear
 13221	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe interpretation of Angel, for Messenger; as John Baptist is called
 13222	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tan Angel, and Christ the Angel of the Covenant; and as (according to the
 13223	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsame Analogy) the Dove, and the Fiery Tongues, in that they were signes
 13224	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Gods speciall presence, might also be called Angels. Though we find
 13225	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin Daniel two names of Angels, Gabriel, and Michael; yet is cleer out of
 13226	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe text it selfe, (Dan. 12.1) that by Michael is meant Christ, not as
 13227	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tan Angel, but as a Prince: and that Gabriel (as the like apparitions
 13228	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmade to other holy men in their sleep) was nothing but a supernaturall
 13229	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tphantasme, by which it seemed to Daniel, in his dream, that two Saints
 13230	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeing in talke, one of them said to the other, "Gabriel, let us make
 13231	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis man understand his Vision:" For God needeth not, to distinguish
 13232	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this Celestiall servants by names, which are usefull onely to the short
 13233	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmemories of Mortalls. Nor in the New Testament is there any place, out
 13234	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof which it can be proved, that Angels (except when they are put for
 13235	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch men, as God hath made the Messengers, and Ministers of his word,
 13236	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor works) are things permanent, and withall incorporeall. That they
 13237	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare permanent, may bee gathered from the words of our Saviour himselfe,
 13238	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(Mat. 25.41.) where he saith, it shall be said to the wicked in the last
 13239	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tday, "Go ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the Devil and his
 13240	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAngels:" which place is manifest for the permanence of Evill Angels,
 13241	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(unlesse wee might think the name of Devill and his Angels may be
 13242	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunderstood of the Churches Adversaries and their Ministers;) but then
 13243	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit is repugnant to their Immateriality; because Everlasting fire is no
 13244	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpunishment to impatible substances, such as are all things Incorporeall.
 13245	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAngels therefore are not thence proved to be Incorporeall. In like
 13246	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmanner where St. Paul sayes (1 Cor. 6.3.) "Knew ye not that wee shall
 13247	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tjudge the Angels?" And (2 Pet. 2.4.) "For if God spared not the Angels
 13248	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat sinned, but cast them down into Hell." And (Jude 1,6.) "And the
 13249	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAngels that kept not their first estate, but left their owne habitation,
 13250	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thee hath reserved in everlasting chaines under darknesse unto the
 13251	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJudgement of the last day;" though it prove the Permanence of Angelicall
 13252	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnature, it confirmeth also their Materiality. And (Mat. 22.30.) In the
 13253	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tresurrection men doe neither marry, nor give in marriage, but are as
 13254	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Angels of God in heaven:" but in the resurrection men shall be
 13255	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPermanent, and not Incorporeall; so therefore also are the Angels.
 13256	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13257	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThere be divers other places out of which may be drawn the like
 13258	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconclusion. To men that understand the signification of these words,
 13259	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSubstance, and Incorporeall; as Incorporeall is taken not for subtile
 13260	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbody, but for Not Body, they imply a contradiction: insomuch as to say,
 13261	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tan Angel, or Spirit is (in that sense) an Incorporeall Substance, is
 13262	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto say in effect, there is no Angel nor Spirit at all. Considering
 13263	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore the signification of the word Angel in the Old Testament, and
 13264	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe nature of Dreams and Visions that happen to men by the ordinary way
 13265	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Nature; I was enclined to this opinion, that Angels were nothing
 13266	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut supernaturall apparitions of the Fancy, raised by the speciall
 13267	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand extraordinary operation of God, thereby to make his presence and
 13268	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommandements known to mankind, and chiefly to his own people. But the
 13269	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmany places of the New Testament, and our Saviours own words, and in
 13270	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch texts, wherein is no suspicion of corruption of the Scripture, have
 13271	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\textorted from my feeble Reason, an acknowledgement, and beleef, that
 13272	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere be also Angels substantiall, and permanent. But to beleeve they be
 13273	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin no place, that is to say, no where, that is to say, nothing, as they
 13274	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(though indirectly) say, that will have them Incorporeall, cannot by
 13275	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tScripture bee evinced.
 13276	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13277	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13278	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13279	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13280	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInspiration What
 13281	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13282	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOn the signification of the word Spirit, dependeth that of the word
 13283	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tINSPIRATION; which must either be taken properly; and then it is nothing
 13284	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut the blowing into a man some thin and subtile aire, or wind, in such
 13285	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmanner as a man filleth a bladder with his breath; or if Spirits be not
 13286	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcorporeal, but have their existence only in the fancy, it is nothing but
 13287	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe blowing in of a Phantasme; which is improper to say, and impossible;
 13288	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor Phantasmes are not, but only seem to be somewhat. That word
 13289	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore is used in the Scripture metaphorically onely: As (Gen. 2.7.)
 13290	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhere it is said, that God Inspired into man the breath of life, no more
 13291	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis meant, then that God gave unto him vitall motion. For we are not to
 13292	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthink that God made first a living breath, and then blew it into Adam
 13293	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tafter he was made, whether that breath were reall, or seeming; but only
 13294	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas it is (Acts 17.25.) "that he gave him life and breath;" that is,
 13295	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmade him a living creature. And where it is said (2 Tim. 3.16.) "all
 13296	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tScripture is given by Inspiration from God," speaking there of the
 13297	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tScripture of the Old Testament, it is an easie metaphor, to signifie,
 13298	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat God enclined the spirit or mind of those Writers, to write that
 13299	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich should be usefull, in teaching, reproving, correcting, and
 13300	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinstructing men in the way of righteous living. But where St. Peter (2
 13301	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPet. 1.21.) saith, that "Prophecy came not in old time by the will
 13302	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof man, but the holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy
 13303	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSpirit," by the Holy Spirit, is meant the voice of God in a Dream, or
 13304	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tVision supernaturall, which is not Inspiration; Nor when our Saviour
 13305	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbreathing on his Disciples, said, "Receive the Holy Spirit," was that
 13306	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBreath the Spirit, but a sign of the spirituall graces he gave unto
 13307	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem. And though it be said of many, and of our Saviour himself, that he
 13308	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas full of the Holy Spirit; yet that Fulnesse is not to be understood
 13309	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor Infusion of the substance of God, but for accumulation of his gifts,
 13310	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch as are the gift of sanctity of life, of tongues, and the like,
 13311	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhether attained supernaturally, or by study and industry; for in all
 13312	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcases they are the gifts of God. So likewise where God sayes (Joel
 13313	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t2.28.) "I will powre out my Spirit upon all flesh, and your Sons and
 13314	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tyour Daughters shall prophecy, your Old men shall dream Dreams, and your
 13315	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tYoung men shall see Visions," wee are not to understand it in the
 13316	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tproper sense, as if his Spirit were like water, subject to effusion, or
 13317	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinfusion; but as if God had promised to give them Propheticall Dreams,
 13318	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Visions. For the proper use of the word Infused, in speaking of
 13319	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe graces of God, is an abuse of it; for those graces are Vertues, not
 13320	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBodies to be carryed hither and thither, and to be powred into men, as
 13321	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinto barrels.
 13322	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13323	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn the same manner, to take Inspiration in the proper sense, or to
 13324	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsay that Good Spirits entred into men to make them prophecy, or Evill
 13325	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSpirits into those that became Phrenetique, Lunatique, or Epileptique,
 13326	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis not to take the word in the sense of the Scripture; for the Spirit
 13327	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere is taken for the power of God, working by causes to us unknown. As
 13328	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talso (Acts 2.2.) the wind, that is there said to fill the house wherein
 13329	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Apostles were assembled on the day of Pentecost, is not to be
 13330	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunderstood for the Holy Spirit, which is the Deity it self; but for an
 13331	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tExternall sign of Gods speciall working on their hearts, to effect in
 13332	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem the internall graces, and holy vertues hee thought requisite for
 13333	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe performance of their Apostleship.

 13343	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKingdom Of God Taken By Divines Metaphorically But In The Scriptures
 13344	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13345	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tProperly
 13346	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13347	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Kingdome of God in the Writings of Divines, and specially in
 13348	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSermons, and Treatises of Devotion, is taken most commonly for Eternall
 13349	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFelicity, after this life, in the Highest Heaven, which they also call
 13350	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Kingdome of Glory; and sometimes for (the earnest of that felicity)
 13351	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSanctification, which they terme the Kingdome of Grace, but never
 13352	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor the Monarchy, that is to say, the Soveraign Power of God over
 13353	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tany Subjects acquired by their own consent, which is the proper
 13354	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsignification of Kingdome.
 13355	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13356	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo the contrary, I find the KINGDOME OF GOD, to signifie in most places
 13357	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Scripture, a Kingdome Properly So Named, constituted by the Votes
 13358	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the People of Israel in peculiar manner; wherein they chose God
 13359	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor their King by Covenant made with him, upon Gods promising them the
 13360	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpossession of the land of Canaan; and but seldom metaphorically;
 13361	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand then it is taken for Dominion Over Sinne; (and only in the New
 13362	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTestament;) because such a Dominion as that, every Subject shall have in
 13363	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Kingdome of God, and without prejudice to the Soveraign.
 13364	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13365	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFrom the very Creation, God not only reigned over all men Naturally by
 13366	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this might; but also had Peculiar Subjects, whom he commanded by a Voice,
 13367	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas one man speaketh to another. In which manner he Reigned over Adam,
 13368	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand gave him commandement to abstaine from the tree of cognizance of
 13369	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGood and Evill; which when he obeyed not, but tasting thereof, took upon
 13370	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim to be as God, judging between Good and Evill, not by his Creators
 13371	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommandement, but by his own sense, his punishment was a privation of
 13372	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe estate of Eternall life, wherein God had at first created him: And
 13373	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tafterwards God punished his posterity, for their vices, all but eight
 13374	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpersons, with an universall deluge; And in these eight did consist the
 13375	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthen Kingdome Of God.

 13379	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13380	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Originall Of The Kingdome Of God
 13381	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13382	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAfter this, it pleased God to speak to Abraham, and (Gen. 17.7,8.) to
 13383	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmake a Covenant with him in these words, "I will establish my Covenant
 13384	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbetween me, and thee, and thy seed after thee in their generations,
 13385	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor an everlasting Covenant, to be a God to thee, and to thy seed after
 13386	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthee; And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land
 13387	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan for an everlasting
 13388	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpossession." And for a memoriall, and a token of this Covenant, he
 13389	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tordaineth (verse 11.) the Sacrament of Circumcision. This is it which is
 13390	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcalled the Old Covenant, or Testament; and containeth a Contract between
 13391	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod and Abraham; by which Abraham obligeth himself, and his posterity,
 13392	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin a peculiar manner to be subject to Gods positive Law; for to the Law
 13393	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMorall he was obliged before, as by an Oath of Allegiance. And though
 13394	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe name of King be not yet given to God, nor of Kingdome to Abraham and
 13395	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this seed; yet the thing is the same; namely, an Institution by pact,
 13396	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Gods peculiar Soveraignty over the seed of Abraham; which in the
 13397	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trenewing of the same Covenant by Moses, at Mount Sinai, is expressely
 13398	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcalled a peculiar Kingdome of God over the Jews: and it is of Abraham
 13399	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(not of Moses) St. Paul saith (Rom. 4.11.) that he is the "Father of the
 13400	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFaithfull," that is, of those that are loyall, and doe not violate their
 13401	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAllegiance sworn to God, then by Circumcision, and afterwards in the New
 13402	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCovenant by Baptisme.

 13404	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13405	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13406	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13407	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThat The Kingdome Of God Is Properly His Civill Soveraignty Over
 13408	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13409	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tA Peculiar People By Pact
 13410	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13411	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThis Covenant, at the Foot of Mount Sinai, was renewed by Moses (Exod.
 13412	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t19.5.) where the Lord commandeth Moses to speak to the people in this
 13413	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmanner, "If you will obey my voice indeed, and keep my Covenant, then
 13414	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tyee shall be a peculiar people to me, for all the Earth is mine; and
 13415	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tyee shall be unto me a Sacerdotall Kingdome, and an holy Nation." For a
 13416	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"Peculiar people" the vulgar Latine hath, Peculium De Cunctis Populis:
 13417	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe English translation made in the beginning of the Reign of King
 13418	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJames, hath, a "Peculiar treasure unto me above all Nations;" and the
 13419	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGeneva French, "the most precious Jewel of all Nations." But the truest
 13420	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTranslation is the first, because it is confirmed by St. Paul himself
 13421	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(Tit. 2.14.) where he saith, alluding to that place, that our blessed
 13422	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSaviour "gave himself for us, that he might purifie us to himself, a
 13423	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpeculiar (that is, an extraordinary) people:" for the word is in the
 13424	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGreek periousios, which is opposed commonly to the word epiousios: and
 13425	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas this signifieth Ordinary, Quotidian, or (as in the Lords Prayer) Of
 13426	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDaily Use; so the other signifieth that which is Overplus, and Stored
 13427	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tUp, and Enjoyed In A Speciall Manner; which the Latines call Peculium;
 13428	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand this meaning of the place is confirmed by the reason God rendereth
 13429	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof it, which followeth immediately, in that he addeth, "For all the
 13430	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEarth is mine," as if he should say, "All the Nations of the world are
 13431	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmine;" but it is not so that you are mine, but in a Speciall Manner: For
 13432	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey are all mine, by reason of my Power; but you shall be mine, by your
 13433	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\town Consent, and Covenant; which is an addition to his ordinary title,
 13434	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto all nations.
 13435	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13436	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe same is again confirmed in expresse words in the same Text, "Yee
 13437	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshall be to me a Sacerdotall Kingdome, and an holy Nation." The Vulgar
 13438	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLatine hath it, Regnum Sacerdotale, to which agreeth the Translation of
 13439	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat place (1 Pet. 2.9.) Sacerdotium Regale, A Regal Priesthood; as also
 13440	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Institution it self, by which no man might enter into the Sanctum
 13441	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSanctorum, that is to say, no man might enquire Gods will immediately of
 13442	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod himselfe, but onely the High Priest. The English Translation before
 13443	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmentioned, following that of Geneva, has, "a Kingdome of Priests;" which
 13444	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis either meant of the succession of one High Priest after another, or
 13445	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\telse it accordeth not with St. Peter, nor with the exercise of the High
 13446	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPriesthood; For there was never any but the High Priest onely, that was
 13447	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto informe the People of Gods Will; nor any Convocation of Priests ever
 13448	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tallowed to enter into the Sanctum Sanctorum.
 13449	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13450	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAgain, the title of a Holy Nation confirmes the same: For Holy
 13451	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsignifies, that which is Gods by speciall, not by generall Right. All
 13452	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Earth (as is said in the text) is Gods; but all the Earth is
 13453	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot called Holy, but that onely which is set apart for his especiall
 13454	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tservice, as was the Nation of the Jews. It is therefore manifest enough
 13455	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby this one place, that by the Kingdome of God, is properly meant a
 13456	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth, instituted (by the consent of those which were to be
 13457	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsubject thereto) for their Civill Government, and the regulating of
 13458	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir behaviour, not onely towards God their King, but also towards one
 13459	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tanother in point of justice, and towards other Nations both in peace and
 13460	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twarre; which properly was a Kingdome, wherein God was King, and the
 13461	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHigh priest was to be (after the death of Moses) his sole Viceroy, or
 13462	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLieutenant.
 13463	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13464	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut there be many other places that clearly prove the same. As first (1
 13465	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSam. 8.7.) when the Elders of Israel (grieved with the corruption of
 13466	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Sons of Samuel) demanded a King, Samuel displeased therewith, prayed
 13467	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunto the Lord; and the Lord answering said unto him, "Hearken unto the
 13468	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tvoice of the People, for they have not rejected thee, but they have
 13469	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trejected me, that I should not reign over them." Out of which it is
 13470	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevident, that God himself was then their King; and Samuel did not
 13471	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommand the people, but only delivered to them that which God from time
 13472	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto time appointed him.
 13473	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13474	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAgain, (1 Sam. 12.12.) where Samuel saith to the People, "When yee saw
 13475	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat Nahash King of the Children of Ammon came against you, ye said unto
 13476	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tme, Nay, but a King shall reign over us, when the Lord your God was your
 13477	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKing:" It is manifest that God was their King, and governed the Civill
 13478	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tState of their Common-wealth.
 13479	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13480	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd after the Israelites had rejected God, the Prophets did foretell his
 13481	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trestitution; as (Isaiah 24.23.) "Then the Moon shall be confounded, and
 13482	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Sun ashamed when the Lord of Hosts shall reign in Mount Zion, and
 13483	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin Jerusalem;" where he speaketh expressely of his Reign in Zion, and
 13484	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJerusalem; that is, on Earth. And (Micah 4.7.) "And the Lord shall
 13485	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treign over them in Mount Zion:" This Mount Zion is in Jerusalem upon the
 13486	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEarth. And (Ezek. 20.33.) "As I live, saith the Lord God, surely with a
 13487	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmighty hand, and a stretched out arme, and with fury powred out, I wil
 13488	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trule over you; and (verse 37.) I will cause you to passe under the rod,
 13489	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand I will bring you into the bond of the Covenant;" that is, I will
 13490	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treign over you, and make you to stand to that Covenant which you made
 13491	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith me by Moses, and brake in your rebellion against me in the days of
 13492	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSamuel, and in your election of another King.
 13493	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13494	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd in the New testament, the Angel Gabriel saith of our Saviour (Luke
 13495	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t1.32,33) "He shall be great, and be called the Son of the Most High,
 13496	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand the Lord shall give him the throne of his Father David; and he shall
 13497	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his Kingdome there shall
 13498	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe no end." This is also a Kingdome upon Earth; for the claim whereof,
 13499	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas an enemy to Caesar, he was put to death; the title of his crosse,
 13500	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas, Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews; hee was crowned in scorn with
 13501	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta crown of Thornes; and for the proclaiming of him, it is said of
 13502	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Disciples (Acts 17.7.) "That they did all of them contrary to
 13503	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe decrees of Caesar, saying there was another King, one Jesus. The
 13504	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKingdome therefore of God, is a reall, not a metaphoricall Kingdome; and
 13505	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tso taken, not onely in the Old Testament, but the New; when we say, "For
 13506	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthine is the Kingdome, the Power, and Glory," it is to be understood of
 13507	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGods Kingdome, by force of our Covenant, not by the Right of Gods Power;
 13508	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor such a Kingdome God alwaies hath; so that it were superfluous to
 13509	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsay in our prayer, "Thy Kingdome come," unlesse it be meant of the
 13510	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRestauration of that Kingdome of God by Christ, which by revolt of the
 13511	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIsraelites had been interrupted in the election of Saul. Nor had it been
 13512	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tproper to say, "The Kingdome of Heaven is at hand," or to pray, "Thy
 13513	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKingdome come," if it had still continued.
 13514	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13515	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThere be so many other places that confirm this interpretation, that it
 13516	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere a wonder there is no greater notice taken of it, but that it gives
 13517	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttoo much light to Christian Kings to see their right of Ecclesiastical
 13518	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGovernment. This they have observed, that in stead of a Sacerdotall
 13519	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKingdome, translate, a Kingdome of Priests: for they may as well
 13520	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttranslate a Royall Priesthood, (as it is in St. Peter) into a Priesthood
 13521	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Kings. And whereas, for a Peculiar People, they put a Pretious Jewel,
 13522	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor Treasure, a man might as well call the speciall Regiment, or Company
 13523	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof a Generall, the Generalls pretious Jewel, or his Treasure.
 13524	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13525	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn short, the Kingdome of God is a Civill Kingdome; which consisted,
 13526	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfirst in the obligation of the people of Israel to those Laws, which
 13527	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMoses should bring unto them from Mount Sinai; and which afterwards the
 13528	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHigh Priest of the time being, should deliver to them from before the
 13529	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCherubins in the Sanctum Sanctorum; and which kingdome having been cast
 13530	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\toff, in the election of Saul, the Prophets foretold, should be restored
 13531	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby Christ; and the Restauration whereof we daily pray for, when we
 13532	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsay in the Lords Prayer, "Thy Kingdome come;" and the Right whereof we
 13533	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tacknowledge, when we adde, "For thine is the Kingdome, the Power, and
 13534	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGlory, for ever and ever, Amen;" and the Proclaiming whereof, was
 13535	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Preaching of the Apostles; and to which men are prepared, by the
 13536	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTeachers of the Gospel; to embrace which Gospel, (that is to say, to
 13537	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpromise obedience to Gods government) is, to bee in the Kingdome of
 13538	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGrace, because God hath gratis given to such the power to bee the
 13539	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsubjects (that is, Children) of God hereafter, when Christ shall come
 13540	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin Majesty to judge the world, and actually to govern his owne people,
 13541	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich is called the Kingdome of Glory. If the Kingdome of God (called
 13542	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talso the Kingdome of Heaven, from the gloriousnesse, and admirable
 13543	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\theight of that throne) were not a Kingdome which God by his Lieutenant,
 13544	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor Vicars, who deliver his Commandements to the people, did exercise on
 13545	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEarth; there would not have been so much contention, and warre, about
 13546	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twho it is, by whom God speaketh to us; neither would many Priests have
 13547	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttroubled themselves with Spirituall Jurisdiction, nor any King have
 13548	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdenied it them.
 13549	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13550	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOut of this literall interpretation of the Kingdome of God, ariseth also
 13551	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe true interpretation of the word HOLY. For it is a word, which in
 13552	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGods Kingdome answereth to that, which men in their Kingdomes use to
 13553	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcall Publique, or the Kings.
 13554	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13555	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe King of any Countrey is the Publique Person, or Representative of
 13556	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall his own Subjects. And God the King of Israel was the Holy One of
 13557	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIsrael. The Nation which is subject to one earthly Soveraign, is the
 13558	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNation of that Soveraign, that is, of the Publique Person. So the Jews,
 13559	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twho were Gods Nation, were called (Exod. 19.6.) "a Holy Nation." For by
 13560	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHoly, is alwaies understood, either God himselfe, or that which is Gods
 13561	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin propriety; as by Publique is alwaies meant, either the Person of the
 13562	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth it self, or something that is so the Common-wealths, as no
 13563	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprivate person can claim any propriety therein.
 13564	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13565	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTherefore the Sabbath (Gods day) is a Holy Day; the Temple, (Gods house)
 13566	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Holy House; Sacrifices, Tithes, and Offerings (Gods tribute) Holy
 13567	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDuties; Priests, Prophets, and anointed Kings, under Christ (Gods
 13568	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tministers) Holy Men; The Coelestiall ministring Spirits (Gods
 13569	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMessengers) Holy Angels; and the like: and wheresoever the word Holy is
 13570	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttaken properly, there is still something signified of Propriety, gotten
 13571	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby consent. In saying "Hallowed be thy name," we do but pray to God for
 13572	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgrace to keep the first Commandement, of "having no other Gods but
 13573	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHim." Mankind is Gods Nation in propriety: but the Jews only were a Holy
 13574	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNation. Why, but because they became his Propriety by covenant.

 13580	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13581	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd the word Profane, is usually taken in the Scripture for the same
 13582	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith Common; and consequently their contraries, Holy, and Proper, in the
 13583	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKingdome of God must be the same also. But figuratively, those men also
 13584	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare called Holy, that led such godly lives, as if they had forsaken all
 13585	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tworldly designes, and wholly devoted, and given themselves to God.
 13586	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn the proper sense, that which is made Holy by Gods appropriating or
 13587	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tseparating it to his own use, is said to be Sanctified by God, as the
 13588	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSeventh day in the fourth Commandement; and as the Elect in the New
 13589	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTestament were said to bee Sanctified, when they were endued with the
 13590	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSpirit of godlinesse. And that which is made Holy by the dedication of
 13591	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen, and given to God, so as to be used onely in his publique service,
 13592	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis called also SACRED, and said to be consecrated, as Temples, and other
 13593	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHouses of Publique Prayer, and their Utensils, Priests, and Ministers,
 13594	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tVictimes, Offerings, and the externall matter of Sacraments.

 13599	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDegrees of Sanctity
 13600	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13601	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf Holinesse there be degrees: for of those things that are set apart
 13602	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor the service of God, there may bee some set apart again, for a neerer
 13603	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand more especial service. The whole Nation of the Israelites were a
 13604	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpeople Holy to God; yet the tribe of Levi was amongst the Israelites a
 13605	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHoly tribe; and amongst the Levites, the Priests were yet more Holy; and
 13606	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tamongst the Priests, the High Priest was the most Holy. So the Land
 13607	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Judea was the Holy Land; but the Holy City wherein God was to be
 13608	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tworshipped, was more Holy; and again, the Temples more Holy than the
 13609	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCity; and the Sanctum Sanctorum more Holy than the rest of the Temple.
 13610	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t

 13614	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSacrament
 13615	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13616	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tA SACRAMENT, is a separation of some visible thing from common use;
 13617	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand a consecration of it to Gods service, for a sign, either of our
 13618	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tadmission into the Kingdome of God, to be of the number of his peculiar
 13619	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpeople, or for a Commemoration of the same. In the Old Testament, the
 13620	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsign of Admission was Circumcision; in the New Testament, Baptisme. The
 13621	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommemoration of it in the Old Testament, was the Eating (at a certain
 13622	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttime, which was Anniversary) of the Paschall Lamb; by which they were
 13623	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tput in mind of the night wherein they were delivered out of their
 13624	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbondage in Egypt; and in the New Testament, the celebrating of the
 13625	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLords Supper; by which, we are put in mind, of our deliverance from
 13626	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe bondage of sin, by our Blessed Saviours death upon the crosse. The
 13627	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSacraments of Admission, are but once to be used, because there needs
 13628	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut one Admission; but because we have need of being often put in
 13629	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmind of our deliverance, and of our Allegeance, The Sacraments of
 13630	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommemoration have need to be reiterated. And these are the principall
 13631	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSacraments, and as it were the solemne oathes we make of our
 13632	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAlleageance. There be also other Consecrations, that may be called
 13633	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSacraments, as the word implyeth onely Consecration to Gods service; but
 13634	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas it implies an oath, or promise of Alleageance to God, there were no
 13635	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother in the Old Testament, but Circumcision, and the Passover; nor
 13636	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare there any other in the New Testament, but Baptisme, and the Lords

 13646	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWord What
 13647	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13648	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhen there is mention of the Word of God, or of Man, it doth not
 13649	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsignifie a part of Speech, such as Grammarians call a Nown, or a Verb,
 13650	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor any simple voice, without a contexture with other words to make it
 13651	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsignificative; but a perfect Speech or Discourse, whereby the speaker
 13652	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAffirmeth, Denieth, Commandeth, Promiseth, Threateneth, Wisheth, or
 13653	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInterrogateth. In which sense it is not Vocabulum, that signifies a
 13654	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWord; but Sermo, (in Greek Logos) that is some Speech, Discourse, or
 13655	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSaying.

 13659	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13660	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Words Spoken By God And Concerning God, Both Are Called Gods Word
 13661	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13662	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn Scripture
 13663	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13664	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAgain, if we say the Word of God, or of Man, it may bee understood
 13665	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsometimes of the Speaker, (as the words that God hath spoken, or that
 13666	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Man hath spoken): In which sense, when we say, the Gospel of St.
 13667	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMatthew, we understand St. Matthew to be the Writer of it: and sometimes
 13668	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Subject: In which sense, when we read in the Bible, "The words
 13669	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the days of the Kings of Israel, or Judah," 'tis meant, that the acts
 13670	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat were done in those days, were the Subject of those Words; And in
 13671	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Greek, which (in the Scripture) retaineth many Hebraismes, by the
 13672	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWord of God is oftentimes meant, not that which is spoken by God, but
 13673	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconcerning God, and his government; that is to say, the Doctrine of
 13674	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tReligion: Insomuch, as it is all one, to say Logos Theou, and Theologia;
 13675	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich is, that Doctrine which wee usually call Divinity, as is manifest
 13676	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby the places following (Acts 13.46.) "Then Paul and Barnabas waxed
 13677	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbold, and said, It was necessary that the Word of God should first
 13678	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave been spoken to you, but seeing you put it from you, and judge your
 13679	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tselves unworthy of everlasting life, loe, we turn to the Gentiles."
 13680	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThat which is here called the Word of god, was the Doctrine of Christian
 13681	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tReligion; as it appears evidently by that which goes before. And (Acts
 13682	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t5.20.) where it is said to the Apostles by an Angel, "Go stand and speak
 13683	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the Temple, all the Words of this life;" by the Words of this life,
 13684	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis meant, the Doctrine of the Gospel; as is evident by what they did in
 13685	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Temple, and is expressed in the last verse of the same Chap. "Daily
 13686	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the Temple, and in every house they ceased not to teach and preach
 13687	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChrist Jesus:" In which place it is manifest, that Jesus Christ was the
 13688	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsubject of this Word of Life; or (which is all one) the subject of the
 13689	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWords of this Life Eternall, that our saviour offered them. So (Acts
 13690	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t15.7.) the Word of God, is called the Word of the Gospel, because it
 13691	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontaineth the Doctrine of the Kingdome of Christ; and the same Word
 13692	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(Rom. 10.8,9.) is called the Word of Faith; that is, as is there
 13693	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texpressed, the Doctrine of Christ come, and raised from the dead. Also
 13694	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(Mat. 13. 19.) "When any one heareth the Word of the Kingdome;" that is,
 13695	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Doctrine of the Kingdome taught by Christ. Again, the same Word, is
 13696	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsaid (Acts 12. 24.) "to grow and to be multiplied;" which to understand
 13697	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Evangelicall Doctrine is easie, but of the Voice, or Speech
 13698	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof God, hard and strange. In the same sense the Doctrine of Devils,
 13699	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsignifieth not the Words of any Devill, but the Doctrine of Heathen men
 13700	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconcerning Daemons, and those Phantasms which they worshipped as Gods.
 13701	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(1 Tim. 4.1.)
 13702	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13703	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConsidering these two significations of the WORD OF GOD, as it is taken
 13704	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin Scripture, it is manifest in this later sense (where it is taken for
 13705	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Doctrine of the Christian Religion,) that the whole scripture is the
 13706	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWord of God: but in the former sense not so. For example, though these
 13707	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twords, "I am the Lord thy God, &c." to the end of the Ten Commandements,
 13708	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere spoken by God to Moses; yet the Preface, "God spake these words
 13709	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand said," is to be understood for the Words of him that wrote the holy
 13710	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHistory. The Word of God, as it is taken for that which he hath spoken,
 13711	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis understood sometimes Properly, sometimes Metaphorically. Properly,
 13712	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas the words, he hath spoken to his Prophets; Metaphorically, for his
 13713	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWisdome, Power, and eternall Decree, in making the world; in which
 13714	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsense, those Fiats, "Let there be light," "Let there be a firmament,"
 13715	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"Let us make man," &c. (Gen. 1.) are the Word of God. And in the same
 13716	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsense it is said (John 1.3.) "All things were made by it, and without it
 13717	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas nothing made that was made; And (Heb. 1.3.) "He upholdeth all things
 13718	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby the word of his Power;" that is, by the Power of his Word; that is,
 13719	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby his Power; and (Heb. 11.3.) "The worlds were framed by the Word
 13720	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof God;" and many other places to the same sense: As also amongst the
 13721	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLatines, the name of Fate, which signifieth properly The Word Spoken, is
 13722	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttaken in the same sense.
 13723	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13724	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13725	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13726	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13727	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSecondly, For The Effect Of His Word
 13728	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13729	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSecondly, for the effect of his Word; that is to say, for the thing it
 13730	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tself, which by his Word is Affirmed, Commanded, Threatned, or Promised;
 13731	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas (Psalm 105.19.) where Joseph is said to have been kept in prison,
 13732	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"till his Word was come;" that is, till that was come to passe which
 13733	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the had (Gen. 40.13.) foretold to Pharaohs Butler, concerning his being
 13734	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trestored to his office: for there by His Word Was Come, is meant, the
 13735	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthing it self was come to passe. So also (1 King. 18.36.) Elijah saith
 13736	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto God, "I have done all these thy Words," in stead of "I have done all
 13737	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthese things at thy Word," or commandement: and (Jer. 17.15.) "Where is
 13738	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Word of the Lord," is put for, "Where is the Evill he threatened:"
 13739	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd (Ezek. 12.28.) "There shall none of my Words be prolonged any
 13740	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmore:" by "Words" are understood those Things, which God promised to his
 13741	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpeople. And in the New Testament (Mat. 24.35.) "heaven and earth shal
 13742	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpass away, but my Words shall not pass away;" that is, there is nothing
 13743	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat I have promised or foretold, that shall not come to passe. And in
 13744	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis sense it is, that St. John the Evangelist, and, I think, St. John
 13745	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tonely calleth our Saviour himself as in the flesh "the Word of God
 13746	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(as Joh. 1.14.) the Word was made Flesh;" that is to say, the Word, or
 13747	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPromise that Christ should come into the world, "who in the beginning
 13748	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas with God;" that is to say, it was in the purpose of God the Father,
 13749	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto send God the Son into the world, to enlighten men in the way of
 13750	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEternall life, but it was not till then put in execution, and actually
 13751	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tincarnate; So that our Saviour is there called "the Word," not because
 13752	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the was the promise, but the thing promised. They that taking occasion
 13753	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom this place, doe commonly call him the Verbe of God, do but render
 13754	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe text more obscure. They might as well term him the Nown of God:
 13755	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor as by Nown, so also by Verbe, men understand nothing but a part
 13756	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof speech, a voice, a sound, that neither affirms, nor denies, nor
 13757	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommands, nor promiseth, nor is any substance corporeall, or spirituall;
 13758	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand therefore it cannot be said to bee either God, or Man; whereas our
 13759	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSaviour is both. And this Word which St. John in his Gospel saith was
 13760	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith God, is (in his 1 Epistle, verse 1.) called "the Word of Life;" and
 13761	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(verse 2.) "The eternall life, which was with the Father:" so that he
 13762	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcan be in no other sense called the Word, then in that, wherein he is
 13763	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcalled Eternall life; that is, "he that hath procured us Eternall life,"
 13764	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby his comming in the flesh. So also (Apocalypse 19.13.) the Apostle
 13765	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tspeaking of Christ, clothed in a garment dipt in bloud, saith; his name
 13766	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis "the Word of God;" which is to be understood, as if he had said his
 13767	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tname had been, "He that was come according to the purpose of God from
 13768	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe beginning, and according to his Word and promises delivered by the
 13769	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tProphets." So that there is nothing here of the Incarnation of a Word,
 13770	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut of the Incarnation of God the Son, therefore called the Word,
 13771	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbecause his Incarnation was the Performance of the Promise; In like
 13772	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmanner as the Holy Ghost is called The Promise. (Acts 1.4. Luke 24.49.)

 13777	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThirdly, For The Words Of Reason And Equity
 13778	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13779	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThere are also places of the Scripture, where, by the Word of God, is
 13780	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsignified such Words as are consonant to reason, and equity, though
 13781	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tspoken sometimes neither by prophet, nor by a holy man. For Pharaoh
 13782	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNecho was an Idolator; yet his Words to the good King Josiah, in which
 13783	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the advised him by Messengers, not to oppose him in his march against
 13784	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCarchemish, are said to have proceeded from the mouth of God; and that
 13785	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJosiah not hearkning to them, was slain in the battle; as is to be read
 13786	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t2 Chron. 35. vers. 21,22,23. It is true, that as the same History is
 13787	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trelated in the first book of Esdras, not Pharaoh, but Jeremiah spake
 13788	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthese words to Josiah, from the mouth of the Lord. But wee are to
 13789	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgive credit to the Canonicall Scripture, whatsoever be written in the
 13790	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tApocrypha.
 13791	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13792	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Word of God, is then also to be taken for the Dictates of reason,
 13793	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand equity, when the same is said in the Scriptures to bee written in
 13794	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmans heart; as Psalm 36.31. Jerem. 31.33. Deut.30.11, 14. and many other
 13795	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlike places.
 13796	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13797	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13798	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13799	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13800	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDivers Acceptions Of The Word Prophet
 13801	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13802	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe name of PROPHET, signifieth in Scripture sometimes Prolocutor; that
 13803	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis, he that speaketh from God to Man, or from man to God: And sometimes
 13804	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPraedictor, or a foreteller of things to come; And sometimes one that
 13805	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tspeaketh incoherently, as men that are distracted. It is most frequently
 13806	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tused in the sense of speaking from God to the People. So Moses, Samuel,
 13807	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tElijah, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and others were Prophets. And in this sense
 13808	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe High Priest was a Prophet, for he only went into the Sanctum
 13809	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSanctorum, to enquire of God; and was to declare his answer to the
 13810	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpeople. And therefore when Caiphas said, it was expedient that one man
 13811	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshould die for the people, St. John saith (chap. 11.51.) that "He spake
 13812	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot this of himselfe, but being High Priest that year, he prophesied
 13813	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat one man should dye for the nation." Also they that in Christian
 13814	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCongregations taught the people, (1 Cor. 14.3.) are said to Prophecy. In
 13815	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe like sense it is, that God saith to Moses (Exod. 4.16.) concerning
 13816	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAaron, "He shall be thy Spokes-man to the People; and he shall be to
 13817	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthee a mouth, and thou shalt be to him in stead of God;" that which here
 13818	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis Spokesman, is (chap.7.1.) interpreted Prophet; "See (saith God)
 13819	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tI have made thee a God to Pharaoh, and Aaron thy Brother shall be thy
 13820	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tProphet." In the sense of speaking from man to God, Abraham is called
 13821	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Prophet (Genes. 20.7.) where God in a Dream speaketh to Abimelech
 13822	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin this manner, "Now therefore restore the man his wife, for he is a
 13823	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tProphet, and shall pray for thee;" whereby may be also gathered,
 13824	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat the name of Prophet may be given, not unproperly to them that
 13825	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin Christian Churches, have a Calling to say publique prayers for the
 13826	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCongregation. In the same sense, the Prophets that came down from the
 13827	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHigh place (or Hill of God) with a Psaltery, and a Tabret, and a Pipe,
 13828	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand a Harp (1 Sam. 10.5,6.) and (vers. 10.) Saul amongst them, are said
 13829	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto Prophecy, in that they praised God, in that manner publiquely. In the
 13830	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlike sense, is Miriam (Exod. 15.20.) called a Prophetesse. So is it
 13831	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talso to be taken (1 Cor. 11.4,5.) where St. Paul saith, "Every man that
 13832	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprayeth or prophecyeth with his head covered, &c. and every woman that
 13833	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprayeth or prophecyeth with her head uncovered: For Prophecy in that
 13834	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tplace, signifieth no more, but praising God in Psalmes, and Holy Songs;
 13835	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich women might doe in the Church, though it were not lawfull for them
 13836	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto speak to the Congregation. And in this signification it is, that the
 13837	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPoets of the Heathen, that composed Hymnes and other sorts of Poems in
 13838	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe honor of their Gods, were called Vates (Prophets) as is well enough
 13839	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tknown by all that are versed in the Books of the Gentiles, and as
 13840	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis evident (Tit. 1.12.) where St. Paul saith of the Cretians, that a
 13841	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tProphet of their owne said, they were Liars; not that St. Paul held
 13842	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir Poets for Prophets, but acknowledgeth that the word Prophet was
 13843	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommonly used to signifie them that celebrated the honour of God in

 13849	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPraediction Of Future Contingents, Not Alwaies Prophecy
 13850	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13851	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhen by Prophecy is meant Praediction, or foretelling of future
 13852	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tContingents; not only they were Prophets, who were Gods Spokesmen, and
 13853	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tforetold those things to others, which God had foretold to them; but
 13854	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talso all those Imposters, that pretend by the helpe of familiar spirits,
 13855	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor by superstitious divination of events past, from false causes, to
 13856	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tforetell the like events in time to come: of which (as I have declared
 13857	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talready in the 12. chapter of this Discourse) there be many kinds, who
 13858	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgain in the opinion of the common sort of men, a greater reputation
 13859	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Prophecy, by one casuall event that may bee but wrested to their
 13860	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpurpose, than can be lost again by never so many failings. Prophecy is
 13861	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot an art, nor (when it is taken for Praediction) a constant Vocation;
 13862	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut an extraordinary, and temporary Employment from God, most often of
 13863	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGood men, but sometimes also of the Wicked. The woman of Endor, who
 13864	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis said to have had a familiar spirit, and thereby to have raised a
 13865	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPhantasme of Samuel, and foretold Saul his death, was not therefore a
 13866	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tProphetesse; for neither had she any science, whereby she could raise
 13867	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch a Phantasme; nor does it appear that God commanded the raising of
 13868	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit; but onely guided that Imposture to be a means of Sauls terror and
 13869	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdiscouragement; and by consequent, of the discomfiture, by which he
 13870	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfell. And for Incoherent Speech, it was amongst the Gentiles taken for
 13871	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tone sort of Prophecy, because the Prophets of their Oracles, intoxicated
 13872	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith a spirit, or vapour from the cave of the Pythian Oracle at Delphi,
 13873	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere for the time really mad, and spake like mad-men; of whose loose
 13874	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twords a sense might be made to fit any event, in such sort, as all
 13875	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbodies are said to be made of Materia prima. In the Scripture I find
 13876	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit also so taken (1 Sam. 18. 10.) in these words, "And the Evill spirit
 13877	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcame upon Saul, and he Prophecyed in the midst of the house."

 13882	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Manner How God Hath Spoken To The Prophets
 13883	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13884	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd although there be so many significations in Scripture of the word
 13885	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tProphet; yet is that the most frequent, in which it is taken for him,
 13886	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto whom God speaketh immediately, that which the Prophet is to say from
 13887	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim, to some other man, or to the people. And hereupon a question may
 13888	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe asked, in what manner God speaketh to such a Prophet. Can it (may some
 13889	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsay) be properly said, that God hath voice and language, when it cannot
 13890	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe properly said, he hath a tongue, or other organs, as a man? The
 13891	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tProphet David argueth thus, "Shall he that made the eye, not see? or he
 13892	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat made the ear, not hear?" But this may be spoken, not (as usually) to
 13893	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsignifie Gods nature, but to signifie our intention to honor him. For
 13894	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto See, and Hear, are Honorable Attributes, and may be given to God, to
 13895	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdeclare (as far as our capacity can conceive) his Almighty power. But
 13896	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tif it were to be taken in the strict, and proper sense, one might argue
 13897	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom his making of all parts of mans body, that he had also the same use
 13898	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof them which we have; which would be many of them so uncomely, as it
 13899	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twould be the greatest contumely in the world to ascribe them to him.
 13900	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTherefore we are to interpret Gods speaking to men immediately, for that
 13901	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tway (whatsoever it be), by which God makes them understand his will: And
 13902	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe wayes whereby he doth this, are many; and to be sought onely in the
 13903	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHoly Scripture: where though many times it be said, that God spake to
 13904	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis, and that person, without declaring in what manner; yet there be
 13905	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagain many places, that deliver also the signes by which they were
 13906	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto acknowledge his presence, and commandement; and by these may be
 13907	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunderstood, how he spake to many of the rest.

 13914	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBy Dreams, Or Visions
 13915	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13916	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn what manner God spake to Adam, and Eve, and Cain, and Noah, is not
 13917	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texpressed; nor how he spake to Abraham, till such time as he came out of
 13918	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this own countrey to Sichem in the land of Canaan; and then (Gen. 12.7.)
 13919	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod is said to have Appeared to him. So there is one way, whereby God
 13920	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmade his presence manifest; that is, by an Apparition, or Vision. And
 13921	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagain, (Gen. 15.1.) The Word of the Lord came to Abraham in a Vision;
 13922	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat is to say, somewhat, as a sign of Gods presence, appeared as Gods
 13923	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMessenger, to speak to him. Again, the Lord appeared to Abraham (Gen.
 13924	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t18. 1.) by an apparition of three Angels; and to Abimelech (Gen. 20. 3.)
 13925	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin a dream: To Lot (Gen. 19. 1.) by an apparition of Two Angels: And
 13926	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto Hagar (Gen. 21. 17.) by the apparition of one Angel: And to Abraham
 13927	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagain (Gen. 22. 11.) by the apparition of a voice from heaven: And (Gen.
 13928	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t26. 24.) to Isaac in the night; (that is, in his sleep, or by dream):
 13929	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd to Jacob (Gen. 18. 12.) in a dream; that is to say (as are the words

 13931	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin a Vision of Angels: And to Moses (Exod. 3.2.) in the apparition of a
 13932	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tflame of fire out of the midst of a bush: And after the time of Moses,
 13933	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(where the manner how God spake immediately to man in the Old Testament,
 13934	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis expressed) hee spake alwaies by a Vision, or by a Dream; as to
 13935	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGideon, Samuel, Eliah, Elisha, Isaiah, Ezekiel, and the rest of the
 13936	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tProphets; and often in the New Testament, as to Joseph, to St. Peter, to
 13937	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSt. Paul, and to St. John the Evangelist in the Apocalypse.
 13938	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13939	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOnely to Moses hee spake in a more extraordinary manner in Mount Sinai,
 13940	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand in the Tabernacle; and to the High Priest in the Tabernacle, and in
 13941	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Sanctum Sanctorum of the Temple. But Moses, and after him the
 13942	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHigh Priests were Prophets of a more eminent place, and degree in
 13943	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGods favour; And God himself in express words declareth, that to other
 13944	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tProphets hee spake in Dreams and Visions, but to his servant Moses, in
 13945	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch manner as a man speaketh to his friend. The words are these (Numb.
 13946	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t12. 6,7,8.) "If there be a Prophet among you, I the Lord will make my
 13947	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tself known to him in a Vision, and will speak unto him in a Dream. My
 13948	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tservant Moses is not so, who is faithfull in all my house; with him I
 13949	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twill speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, not in dark speeches; and
 13950	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe similitude of the Lord shall he behold." And (Exod. 33. 11.) "The
 13951	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLord spake to Moses face to face, as a man speaketh to his friend."
 13952	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd yet this speaking of God to Moses, was by mediation of an Angel, or
 13953	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAngels, as appears expressely, Acts 7. ver. 35. and 53. and Gal. 3. 19.
 13954	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand was therefore a Vision, though a more cleer Vision than was given to
 13955	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother Prophets. And conformable hereunto, where God saith (Deut. 13. 1.)
 13956	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"If there arise amongst you a Prophet, or Dreamer of Dreams," the later
 13957	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tword is but the interpretation of the former. And (Joel 2. 28.) "Your
 13958	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsons and your daughters shall Prophecy; your old men shall dream Dreams,
 13959	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand your young men shall see Visions:" where again, the word Prophecy is
 13960	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texpounded by Dream, and Vision. And in the same manner it was, that God
 13961	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tspake to Solomon, promising him Wisdome, Riches, and Honor; for the text
 13962	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsaith, (1 Kings 3. 15.) "And Solomon awoak, and behold it was a Dream:"
 13963	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSo that generally the Prophets extraordinary in the old Testament took
 13964	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnotice of the Word of God no otherwise, than from their Dreams, or
 13965	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tVisions, that is to say, from the imaginations which they had in their
 13966	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsleep, or in an Extasie; which imaginations in every true Prophet were
 13967	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsupernaturall; but in false Prophets were either naturall, or feigned.
 13968	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13969	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe same Prophets were neverthelesse said to speak by the Spirit; as
 13970	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(Zach. 7. 12.) where the Prophet speaking of the Jewes, saith, "They
 13971	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmade their hearths hard as Adamant, lest they should hear the law, and
 13972	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe words which the Lord of Hosts hath sent in his Spirit by the former
 13973	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tProphets." By which it is manifest, that speaking by the Spirit, or
 13974	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInspiration, was not a particular manner of Gods speaking, different
 13975	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom Vision, when they that were said to speak by the Spirit, were
 13976	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\textraordinary Prophets, such as for every new message, were to have a
 13977	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tparticular Commission, or (which is all one) a new Dream, or Vision.
 13978	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 13979	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo Prophets Of Perpetuall Calling, And Supreme, God Spake In The
 13980	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOld Testament From The Mercy Seat, In A Manner Not Expressed In The
 13981	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tScripture. Of Prophets, that were so by a perpetuall Calling in the Old
 13982	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTestament, some were Supreme, and some Subordinate: Supreme were first
 13983	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMoses; and after him the High Priest, every one for his time, as long
 13984	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas the Priesthood was Royall; and after the people of the Jews, had
 13985	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trejected God, that he should no more reign over them, those Kings which
 13986	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsubmitted themselves to Gods government, were also his chief Prophets;
 13987	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand the High Priests office became Ministeriall. And when God was to be
 13988	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsulted, they put on the holy vestments, and enquired of the Lord,
 13989	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas the King commanded them, and were deprived of their office, when
 13990	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe King thought fit. For King Saul (1 Sam. 13. 9.) commanded the burnt
 13991	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\toffering to be brought, and (1 Sam. 14. 18.) he commands the Priest to
 13992	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbring the Ark neer him; and (ver. 19.) again to let it alone, because he
 13993	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsaw an advantage upon his enemies. And in the same chapter Saul asketh
 13994	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcounsell of God. In like manner King David, after his being anointed,
 13995	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthough before he had possession of the Kingdome, is said to "enquire
 13996	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Lord" (1 Sam. 23. 2.) whether he should fight against the
 13997	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPhilistines at Keilah; and (verse 10.) David commandeth the Priest to
 13998	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbring him the Ephod, to enquire whether he should stay in Keilah,
 13999	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor not. And King Solomon (1 Kings 2. 27.) took the Priesthood from
 14000	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAbiathar, and gave it (verse 35.) to Zadoc. Therefore Moses, and
 14001	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe High Priests, and the pious Kings, who enquired of God on all
 14002	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\textraordinary occasions, how they were to carry themselves, or what
 14003	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevent they were to have, were all Soveraign Prophets. But in what manner
 14004	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod spake unto them, is not manifest. To say that when Moses went up to
 14005	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod in Mount Sinai, it was a Dream, or Vision, such as other Prophets
 14006	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thad, is contrary to that distinction which God made between Moses, and
 14007	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother Prophets, Numb. 12. 6,7,8. To say God spake or appeared as he
 14008	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis in his own nature, is to deny his Infinitenesse, Invisibility,
 14009	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIncomprehensibility. To say he spake by Inspiration, or Infusion of the
 14010	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHoly Spirit, as the Holy Spirit signifieth the Deity, is to make Moses
 14011	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tequall with Christ, in whom onely the Godhead (as St. Paul speaketh Col.
 14012	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t2.9.) dwelleth bodily. And lastly, to say he spake by the Holy Spirit,
 14013	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas it signifieth the graces, or gifts of the Holy Spirit, is to
 14014	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tattribute nothing to him supernaturall. For God disposeth men to Piety,
 14015	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJustice, Mercy, Truth, Faith, and all manner of Vertue, both Morall,
 14016	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Intellectuall, by doctrine, example, and by severall occasions,
 14017	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnaturall, and ordinary.
 14018	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14019	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd as these ways cannot be applyed to God, in his speaking to Moses, at
 14020	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMount Sinai; so also, they cannot be applyed to him, in his speaking
 14021	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto the High Priests, from the Mercy-Seat. Therefore in what manner God
 14022	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tspake to those Soveraign Prophets of the Old Testament, whose office
 14023	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit was to enquire of him, is not intelligible. In the time of the New
 14024	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTestament, there was no Soveraign Prophet, but our Saviour; who was both
 14025	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod that spake, and the Prophet to whom he spake.
 14026	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14027	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo Prophets Of Perpetuall Calling, But Subordinate, God Spake By The
 14028	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSpirit. To subordinate Prophets of perpetuall Calling, I find not any
 14029	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tplace that proveth God spake to them supernaturally; but onely in
 14030	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch manner, as naturally he inclineth men to Piety, to Beleef, to
 14031	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRighteousnesse, and to other vertues all other Christian Men. Which
 14032	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tway, though it consist in Constitution, Instruction, Education, and the
 14033	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\toccasions and invitements men have to Christian vertues; yet it is truly
 14034	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tattributed to the operation of the Spirit of God, or Holy Spirit
 14035	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(which we in our language call the Holy Ghost): For there is no good
 14036	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinclination, that is not of the operation of God. But these operations
 14037	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare not alwaies supernaturall. When therefore a Prophet is said to speak
 14038	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the Spirit, or by the Spirit of God, we are to understand no more,
 14039	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut that he speaks according to Gods will, declared by the supreme
 14040	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tProphet. For the most common acceptation of the word Spirit, is in the
 14041	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsignification of a mans intention, mind, or disposition.
 14042	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14043	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn the time of Moses, there were seventy men besides himself, that
 14044	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tProphecyed in the Campe of the Israelites. In what manner God spake to
 14045	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem, is declared in the 11 of Numbers, verse 25. "The Lord came down in
 14046	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta cloud, and spake unto Moses, and took of the Spirit that was upon him,
 14047	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand gave it to the seventy Elders. And it came to passe, when the Spirit
 14048	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trested upon them, they Prophecyed, and did not cease," By which it is
 14049	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmanifest, first, that their Prophecying to the people, was subservient,
 14050	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand subordinate to the Prophecying of Moses; for that God took of the
 14051	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSpirit of Moses, to put upon them; so that they Prophecyed as Moses
 14052	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twould have them: otherwise they had not been suffered to Prophecy at
 14053	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall. For there was (verse 27.) a complaint made against them to Moses;
 14054	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Joshua would have Moses to have forbidden them; which he did not,
 14055	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut said to Joshua, Bee not jealous in my behalf. Secondly, that
 14056	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Spirit of God in that place, signifieth nothing but the Mind and
 14057	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDisposition to obey, and assist Moses in the administration of the
 14058	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGovernment. For if it were meant they had the substantial Spirit of God;
 14059	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat is, the Divine nature, inspired into them, then they had it in no
 14060	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlesse manner than Christ himself, in whom onely the Spirit of God dwelt
 14061	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbodily. It is meant therefore of the Gift and Grace of God, that guided
 14062	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem to co-operate with Moses; from whom their Spirit was derived. And
 14063	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit appeareth (verse 16.) that, they were such as Moses himself should
 14064	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tappoint for Elders and Officers of the People: For the words are,
 14065	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"Gather unto me seventy men, whom thou knowest to be Elders and
 14066	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOfficers of the people:" where, "thou knowest," is the same with "thou
 14067	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tappointest," or "hast appointed to be such." For we are told
 14068	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbefore (Exod. 18.) that Moses following the counsell of Jethro his
 14069	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFather-in-law, did appoint Judges, and Officers over the people, such as
 14070	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfeared God; and of these, were those Seventy, whom God by putting upon
 14071	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem Moses spirit, inclined to aid Moses in the Administration of the
 14072	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKingdome: and in this sense the Spirit of God is said (1 Sam. 16. 13,
 14073	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t14.) presently upon the anointing of David, to have come upon David, and
 14074	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tleft Saul; God giving his graces to him he chose to govern his people,
 14075	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand taking them away from him, he rejected. So that by the Spirit is
 14076	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmeant Inclination to Gods service; and not any supernaturall Revelation.
 14077	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14078	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14079	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14080	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14081	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod Sometimes Also Spake By Lots
 14082	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14083	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod spake also many times by the event of Lots; which were ordered by
 14084	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch as he had put in Authority over his people. So wee read that God
 14085	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmanifested by the Lots which Saul caused to be drawn (1 Sam. 14. 43.)
 14086	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe fault that Jonathan had committed, in eating a honey-comb, contrary
 14087	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto the oath taken by the people. And (Josh. 18. 10.) God divided the
 14088	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tland of Canaan amongst the Israelite, by the "lots that Joshua did cast
 14089	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbefore the Lord in Shiloh." In the same manner it seemeth to be, that
 14090	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod discovered (Joshua 7.16., &c.) the crime of Achan. And these are the
 14091	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twayes whereby God declared his Will in the Old Testament.
 14092	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14093	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAll which ways he used also in the New Testament. To the Virgin Mary, by
 14094	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Vision of an Angel: To Joseph in a Dream: again to Paul in the way
 14095	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto Damascus in a Vision of our Saviour: and to Peter in the Vision of
 14096	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta sheet let down from heaven, with divers sorts of flesh, of clean and
 14097	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunclean, beasts; and in prison, by Vision of an Angel: And to all the
 14098	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tApostles, and Writers of the New Testament, by the graces of his Spirit;
 14099	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand to the Apostles again (at the choosing of Matthias in the place of
 14100	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJudas Iscariot) by lot.
 14101	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14102	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14103	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14104	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14105	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEvery Man Ought To Examine The Probability Of A Pretended Prophets
 14106	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14107	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCalling
 14108	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14109	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSeeing then all Prophecy supposeth Vision, or Dream, (which two, when
 14110	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey be naturall, are the same,) or some especiall gift of God, so
 14111	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trarely observed in mankind, as to be admired where observed; and seeing
 14112	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas well such gifts, as the most extraordinary Dreams, and Visions, may
 14113	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tproceed from God, not onely by his supernaturall, and immediate, but
 14114	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talso by his naturall operation, and by mediation of second causes;
 14115	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere is need of Reason and Judgement to discern between naturall, and
 14116	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsupernaturall Gifts, and between naturall, and supernaturall Visions, or
 14117	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDreams. And consequently men had need to be very circumspect, and wary,
 14118	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin obeying the voice of man, that pretending himself to be a Prophet,
 14119	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trequires us to obey God in that way, which he in Gods name telleth us to
 14120	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe the way to happinesse. For he that pretends to teach men the way of
 14121	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tso great felicity, pretends to govern them; that is to say, to rule, and
 14122	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treign over them; which is a thing, that all men naturally desire, and
 14123	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis therefore worthy to be suspected of Ambition and Imposture; and
 14124	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsequently, ought to be examined, and tryed by every man, before hee
 14125	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tyeeld them obedience; unlesse he have yeelded it them already, in
 14126	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe institution of a Common-wealth; as when the Prophet is the Civill
 14127	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign, or by the Civil Soveraign Authorized. And if this examination
 14128	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Prophets, and Spirits, were not allowed to every one of the people,
 14129	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit had been to no purpose, to set out the marks, by which every man
 14130	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmight be able, to distinguish between those, whom they ought, and those
 14131	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhom they ought not to follow. Seeing therefore such marks are set out
 14132	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(Deut. 13. 1,&c.) to know a Prophet by; and (1 John 4.1.&C) to know a
 14133	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSpirit by: and seeing there is so much Prophecying in the Old Testament;
 14134	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand so much Preaching in the New Testament against Prophets; and so much
 14135	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgreater a number ordinarily of false Prophets, then of true; every
 14136	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tone is to beware of obeying their directions, at their own perill. And
 14137	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfirst, that there were many more false than true Prophets, appears by
 14138	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis, that when Ahab (1 Kings 12.) consulted four hundred Prophets, they
 14139	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere all false Imposters, but onely one Michaiah. And a little before
 14140	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe time of the Captivity, the Prophets were generally lyars. "The
 14141	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tProphets" (saith the Lord by Jerem. cha. 14. verse 14.) "prophecy Lies
 14142	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin my name. I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, nor spake
 14143	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunto them, they prophecy to you a false Vision, a thing of naught; and
 14144	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe deceit of their heart." In so much as God commanded the People by
 14145	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe mouth of the Prophet Jeremiah (chap. 23. 16.) not to obey them.
 14146	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, hearken not unto the words of the
 14147	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tProphets, that prophecy to you. They make you vain, they speak a Vision
 14148	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the Lord."
 14149	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14150	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14151	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14152	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14153	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAll Prophecy But Of The Soveraign Prophet Is To Be Examined
 14154	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14155	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBy Every Subject
 14156	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14157	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSeeing then there was in the time of the Old Testament, such quarrells
 14158	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tamongst the Visionary Prophets, one contesting with another, and asking
 14159	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhen departed the Spirit from me, to go to thee? as between Michaiah,
 14160	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand the rest of the four hundred; and such giving of the Lye to one
 14161	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tanother, (as in Jerem. 14.14.) and such controversies in the New
 14162	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTestament at this day, amongst the Spirituall Prophets: Every man then
 14163	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas, and now is bound to make use of his Naturall Reason, to apply to
 14164	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall Prophecy those Rules which God hath given us, to discern the
 14165	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttrue from the false. Of which rules, in the Old Testament, one was,
 14166	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconformable doctrine to that which Moses the Soveraign Prophet had
 14167	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttaught them; and the other the miraculous power of foretelling what God
 14168	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twould bring to passe, as I have already shown out of Deut. 13. 1. &c.
 14169	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand in the New Testament there was but one onely mark; and that was the
 14170	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpreaching of this Doctrine, That Jesus Is The Christ, that is, the
 14171	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKing of the Jews, promised in the Old Testament. Whosoever denyed that
 14172	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tArticle, he was a false Prophet, whatsoever miracles he might seem to
 14173	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twork; and he that taught it was a true Prophet. For St. John (1 Epist,
 14174	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t4. 2, &c) speaking expressely of the means to examine Spirits, whether
 14175	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey be of God, or not; after he hath told them that there would arise
 14176	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfalse Prophets, saith thus, "Hereby know ye the Spirit of God. Every
 14177	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSpirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is of
 14178	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod;" that is, is approved and allowed as a Prophet of God: not that
 14179	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the is a godly man, or one of the Elect, for this, that he confesseth,
 14180	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprofesseth, or preacheth Jesus to be the Christ; but for that he is a
 14181	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tProphet avowed. For God sometimes speaketh by Prophets, whose persons he
 14182	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thath not accepted; as he did by Baalam; and as he foretold Saul of his
 14183	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdeath, by the Witch of Endor. Again in the next verse, "Every Spirit
 14184	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the Flesh, is not
 14185	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Christ. And this is the Spirit of Antichrist." So that the rule is
 14186	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tperfect on both sides; that he is a true Prophet, which preacheth the
 14187	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMessiah already come, in the person of Jesus; and he a false one that
 14188	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdenyeth him come, and looketh for him in some future Imposter, that
 14189	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshall take upon him that honour falsely, whom the Apostle there properly
 14190	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcalleth Antichrist. Every man therefore ought to consider who is the
 14191	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign Prophet; that is to say, who it is, that is Gods Viceregent
 14192	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ton earth; and hath next under God, the Authority of Governing Christian
 14193	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen; and to observe for a Rule, that Doctrine, which in the name of
 14194	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod, hee commanded to bee taught; and thereby to examine and try out
 14195	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe truth of those Doctrines, which pretended Prophets with miracles, or
 14196	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twithout, shall at any time advance: and if they find it contrary to that
 14197	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRule, to doe as they did, that came to Moses, and complained that there
 14198	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere some that Prophecyed in the Campe, whose Authority so to doe they
 14199	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdoubted of; and leave to the Soveraign, as they did to Moses to uphold,
 14200	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor to forbid them, as hee should see cause; and if hee disavow them,
 14201	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthen no more to obey their voice; or if he approve them, then to obey
 14202	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem, as men to whom God hath given a part of the Spirit of their
 14203	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraigne. For when Christian men, take not their Christian Soveraign,
 14204	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor Gods Prophet; they must either take their owne Dreams, for the
 14205	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprophecy they mean to bee governed by, and the tumour of their own
 14206	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thearts for the Spirit of God; or they must suffer themselves to bee lead
 14207	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby some strange Prince; or by some of their fellow subjects, that can
 14208	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbewitch them, by slander of the government, into rebellion, without
 14209	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother miracle to confirm their calling, then sometimes an extraordinary
 14210	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuccesse, and Impunity; and by this means destroying all laws, both
 14211	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdivine, and humane, reduce all Order, Government, and Society, to the
 14212	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfirst Chaos of Violence, and Civill warre.

 14221	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tA Miracle Is A Work That Causeth Admiration
 14222	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14223	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBy Miracles are signified the Admirable works of God: & therefore they
 14224	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare also called Wonders. And because they are for the most part, done,
 14225	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor a signification of his commandement, in such occasions, as
 14226	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twithout them, men are apt to doubt, (following their private naturall
 14227	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treasoning,) what he hath commanded, and what not, they are commonly in
 14228	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHoly Scripture, called Signes, in the same sense, as they are called by
 14229	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Latines, Ostenta, and Portenta, from shewing, and fore-signifying
 14230	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat, which the Almighty is about to bring to passe.
 14231	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14232	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14233	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14234	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14235	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd Must Therefore Be Rare, Whereof There Is No Naturall Cause Known
 14236	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14237	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo understand therefore what is a Miracle, we must first understand what
 14238	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tworks they are, which men wonder at, and call Admirable. And there be
 14239	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut two things which make men wonder at any event: The one is, if it
 14240	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe strange, that is to say, such, as the like of it hath never, or very
 14241	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trarely been produced: The other is, if when it is produced, we cannot
 14242	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\timagine it to have been done by naturall means, but onely by the
 14243	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\timmediate hand of God. But when wee see some possible, naturall cause of
 14244	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit, how rarely soever the like has been done; or if the like have been
 14245	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\toften done, how impossible soever it be to imagine a naturall means
 14246	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthereof, we no more wonder, nor esteem it for a Miracle.
 14247	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14248	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTherefore, if a Horse, or Cow should speak, it were a Miracle; because
 14249	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tboth the thing is strange, & the Naturall cause difficult to imagin: So
 14250	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talso were it, to see a strange deviation of nature, in the production
 14251	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof some new shape of a living creature. But when a man, or other Animal,
 14252	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tengenders his like, though we know no more how this is done, than the
 14253	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother; yet because 'tis usuall, it is no Miracle. In like manner, if a
 14254	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman be metamorphosed into a stone, or into a pillar, it is a Miracle;
 14255	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbecause strange: but if a peece of wood be so changed; because we see it
 14256	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\toften, it is no Miracle: and yet we know no more, by what operation of
 14257	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod, the one is brought to passe, than the other.
 14258	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14259	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe first Rainbow that was seen in the world, was a Miracle, because the
 14260	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfirst; and consequently strange; and served for a sign from God, placed
 14261	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin heaven, to assure his people, there should be no more an universall
 14262	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdestruction of the world by Water. But at this day, because they
 14263	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare frequent, they are not Miracles, neither to them that know their
 14264	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnaturall causes, nor to them who know them not. Again, there be many
 14265	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trare works produced by the Art of man: yet when we know they are done;
 14266	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbecause thereby wee know also the means how they are done, we count them
 14267	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot for Miracles, because not wrought by the immediate hand of God, but
 14268	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby mediation of humane Industry.
 14269	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t

 14273	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThat Which Seemeth A Miracle To One Man, May Seem Otherwise To Another
 14274	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14275	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFurthermore, seeing Admiration and Wonder, is consequent to the
 14276	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tknowledge and experience, wherewith men are endued, some more, some
 14277	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlesse; it followeth, that the same thing, may be a Miracle to one, and
 14278	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot to another. And thence it is, that ignorant, and superstitious men
 14279	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmake great Wonders of those works, which other men, knowing to proceed
 14280	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom Nature, (which is not the immediate, but the ordinary work of God,)
 14281	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tadmire not at all: As when Ecclipses of the Sun and Moon have been taken
 14282	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor supernaturall works, by the common people; when neverthelesse, there
 14283	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere others, could from their naturall causes, have foretold the very
 14284	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thour they should arrive: Or, as when a man, by confederacy, and secret
 14285	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tintelligence, getting knowledge of the private actions of an ignorant,
 14286	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunwary man, thereby tells him, what he has done in former time; it seems
 14287	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto him a Miraculous thing; but amongst wise, and cautelous men, such
 14288	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMiracles as those, cannot easily be done.

 14292	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14293	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe End Of Miracles
 14294	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14295	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAgain, it belongeth to the nature of a Miracle, that it be wrought for
 14296	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe procuring of credit to Gods Messengers, Ministers, and Prophets,
 14297	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat thereby men may know, they are called, sent, and employed by God,
 14298	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand thereby be the better inclined to obey them. And therefore, though
 14299	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe creation of the world, and after that the destruction of all living
 14300	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcreatures in the universall deluge, were admirable works; yet because
 14301	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey were not done to procure credit to any Prophet, or other Minister
 14302	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof God, they use not to be called Miracles. For how admirable soever any
 14303	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twork be, the Admiration consisteth not in that it could be done, because
 14304	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen naturally beleeve the Almighty can doe all things, but because he
 14305	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdoes it at the Prayer, or Word of a man. But the works of God in Egypt,
 14306	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby the hand of Moses, were properly Miracles; because they were done
 14307	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith intention to make the people of Israel beleeve, that Moses came
 14308	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunto them, not out of any design of his owne interest, but as sent from
 14309	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod. Therefore after God had commanded him to deliver the Israelites
 14310	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom the Egyptian bondage, when he said (Exod 4.1. &c.) "They will not
 14311	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeleeve me, but will say, the Lord hath not appeared unto me," God gave
 14312	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim power, to turn the Rod he had in his hand into a Serpent, and again
 14313	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto return it into a Rod; and by putting his hand into his bosome, to
 14314	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmake it leprous; and again by pulling it out to make it whole, to make
 14315	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Children of Israel beleeve (as it is verse 5.) that the God of their
 14316	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFathers had appeared unto him; And if that were not enough, he gave
 14317	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim power to turn their waters into bloud. And when hee had done these
 14318	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMiracles before the people, it is said (verse 41.) that "they beleeved
 14319	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim." Neverthelesse, for fear of Pharaoh, they durst not yet obey him.
 14320	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTherefore the other works which were done to plague Pharaoh and the
 14321	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEgyptians, tended all to make the Israelites beleeve in Moses, and were
 14322	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tproperly Miracles. In like manner if we consider all the Miracles
 14323	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdone by the hand of Moses, and all the rest of the Prophets, till the
 14324	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCaptivity; and those of our Saviour, and his Apostles afterward; we
 14325	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshall find, their end was alwaies to beget, or confirm beleefe, that
 14326	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey came not of their own motion, but were sent by God. Wee may further
 14327	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobserve in Scripture, that the end of Miracles, was to beget beleef,
 14328	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot universally in all men, elect, and reprobate; but in the elect
 14329	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tonly; that is to say, is such as God had determined should become his
 14330	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSubjects. For those miraculous plagues of Egypt, had not for end, the
 14331	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconversion of Pharaoh; For God had told Moses before, that he would
 14332	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tharden the heart of Pharaoh, that he should not let the people goe: And
 14333	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhen he let them goe at last, not the Miracles perswaded him, but the
 14334	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tplagues forced him to it. So also of our Saviour, it is written, (Mat.
 14335	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t13. 58.) that he wrought not many Miracles in his own countrey, because
 14336	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof their unbeleef; and (in Marke 6.5.) in stead of, "he wrought not
 14337	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmany," it is, "he could work none." It was not because he wanted power;
 14338	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich to say, were blasphemy against God; nor that the end of Miracles
 14339	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas not to convert incredulous men to Christ; for the end of all the
 14340	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMiracles of Moses, of Prophets, of our Saviour, and of his Apostles
 14341	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas to adde men to the Church; but it was, because the end of their
 14342	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMiracles, was to adde to the Church (not all men, but) such as should
 14343	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe saved; that is to say, such as God had elected. Seeing therefore
 14344	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tour Saviour sent from his Father, hee could not use his power in the
 14345	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconversion of those, whom his Father had rejected. They that expounding
 14346	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis place of St. Marke, say, that his word, "Hee could not," is put
 14347	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor, "He would not," do it without example in the Greek tongue, (where
 14348	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWould Not, is put sometimes for Could Not, in things inanimate, that
 14349	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave no will; but Could Not, for Would Not, never,) and thereby lay
 14350	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta stumbling block before weak Christians; as if Christ could doe no
 14351	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMiracles, but amongst the credulous.
 14352	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14353	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14354	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14355	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14356	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Definition Of A Miracle
 14357	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14358	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFrom that which I have here set down, of the nature, and use of a
 14359	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMiracle, we may define it thus, "A MIRACLE, is a work of God, (besides
 14360	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this operation by the way of Nature, ordained in the Creation,) done
 14361	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor the making manifest to his elect, the mission of an extraordinary
 14362	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMinister for their salvation."
 14363	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14364	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd from this definition, we may inferre; First, that in all Miracles,
 14365	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe work done, is not the effect of any vertue in the Prophet; because
 14366	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit is the effect of the immediate hand of God; that is to say God hath
 14367	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdone it, without using the Prophet therein, as a subordinate cause.
 14368	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14369	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSecondly, that no Devil, Angel, or other created Spirit, can do a
 14370	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMiracle. For it must either be by vertue of some naturall science, or
 14371	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby Incantation, that is, vertue of words. For if the Inchanters do it
 14372	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby their own power independent, there is some power that proceedeth not
 14373	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom God; which all men deny: and if they doe it by power given them,
 14374	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthen is the work not from the immediate hand of God, but naturall, and
 14375	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsequently no Miracle.
 14376	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14377	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThere be some texts of Scripture, that seem to attribute the power of
 14378	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tworking wonders (equall to some of those immediate Miracles, wrought
 14379	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby God himself,) to certain Arts of Magick, and Incantation. As for
 14380	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texample, when we read that after the Rod of Moses being cast on the
 14381	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tground became a Serpent, (Exod. 7. 11.) "the Magicians of Egypt did the
 14382	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlike by their Enchantments;" and that after Moses had turned the waters
 14383	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Egyptian Streams, Rivers, Ponds, and Pooles of water into blood,
 14384	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(Exod. 7. 22.) "the Magicians of Egypt did so likewise, with their
 14385	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEnchantments;" and that after Moses had by the power of God brought
 14386	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrogs upon the land, (Exod. 8. 7.) "the Magicians also did so with their
 14387	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEnchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt;" will not a
 14388	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman be apt to attribute Miracles to Enchantments; that is to say, to the
 14389	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tefficacy of the sound of Words; and think the same very well proved out
 14390	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof this, and other such places? and yet there is no place of Scripture,
 14391	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat telleth us what on Enchantment is. If therefore Enchantment be not,
 14392	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas many think it, a working of strange effects by spells, and words;
 14393	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut Imposture, and delusion, wrought by ordinary means; and so far
 14394	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom supernaturall, as the Impostors need not the study so much as of
 14395	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnaturall causes, but the ordinary ignorance, stupidity, and superstition
 14396	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof mankind, to doe them; those texts that seem to countenance the power
 14397	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Magick, Witchcraft, and Enchantment, must needs have another sense,
 14398	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthan at first sight they seem to bear.
 14399	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14400	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14401	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14402	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14403	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThat Men Are Apt To Be Deceived By False Miracles
 14404	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14405	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor it is evident enough, that Words have no effect, but on those
 14406	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat understand them; and then they have no other, but to signifie the
 14407	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tintentions, or passions of them that speak; and thereby produce, hope,
 14408	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfear, or other passions, or conceptions in the hearer. Therefore when a
 14409	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRod seemeth a Serpent, or the Water Bloud, or any other Miracle seemeth
 14410	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdone by Enchantment; if it be not to the edification of Gods people,
 14411	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot the Rod, nor the Water, nor any other thing is enchanted; that is
 14412	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto say, wrought upon by the Words, but the Spectator. So that all the
 14413	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMiracle consisteth in this, that the Enchanter has deceived a man; which
 14414	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis no Miracle, but a very easie matter to doe.
 14415	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14416	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor such is the ignorance, and aptitude to error generally of all men,
 14417	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut especially of them that have not much knowledge of naturall causes,
 14418	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand of the nature, and interests of men; as by innumerable and easie
 14419	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttricks to be abused. What opinion of miraculous power, before it was
 14420	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tknown there was a Science of the course of the Stars, might a man have
 14421	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgained, that should have told the people, This hour, or day the Sun
 14422	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshould be darkned? A juggler by the handling of his goblets, and other
 14423	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttrinkets, if it were not now ordinarily practised, would be thought
 14424	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto do his wonders by the power at least of the Devil. A man that hath
 14425	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpractised to speak by drawing in of his breath, (which kind of men in
 14426	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tantient time were called Ventriloqui,) and so make the weaknesse of
 14427	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this voice seem to proceed, not from the weak impulsion of the organs
 14428	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Speech, but from distance of place, is able to make very many men
 14429	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeleeve it is a voice from Heaven, whatsoever he please to tell them.
 14430	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd for a crafty man, that hath enquired into the secrets, and familiar
 14431	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconfessions that one man ordinarily maketh to another of his actions and
 14432	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tadventures past, to tell them him again is no hard matter; and yet there
 14433	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe many, that by such means as that, obtain the reputation of being
 14434	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConjurers. But it is too long a businesse, to reckon up the severall
 14435	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsorts of those men, which the Greeks called Thaumaturgi, that is to say,
 14436	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tworkers of things wonderfull; and yet these do all they do, by their
 14437	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\town single dexterity. But if we looke upon the Impostures wrought by
 14438	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConfederacy, there is nothing how impossible soever to be done, that is
 14439	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\timpossible to bee beleeved. For two men conspiring, one to seem lame,
 14440	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe other to cure him with a charme, will deceive many: but many
 14441	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconspiring, one to seem lame, another so to cure him, and all the rest
 14442	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto bear witnesse; will deceive many more.

 14447	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCautions Against The Imposture Of Miracles
 14448	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14449	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn this aptitude of mankind, to give too hasty beleefe to pretended
 14450	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMiracles, there can be no better, nor I think any other caution, than
 14451	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat which God hath prescribed, first by Moses, (as I have said before
 14452	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the precedent chapter,) in the beginning of the 13. and end of the
 14453	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t18. of Deuteronomy; That wee take not any for Prophets, that teach any
 14454	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother Religion, then that which Gods Lieutenant, (which at that time was
 14455	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMoses,) hath established; nor any, (though he teach the same Religion,)
 14456	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhose Praediction we doe not see come to passe. Moses therefore in his
 14457	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttime, and Aaron, and his successors in their times, and the Soveraign
 14458	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGovernour of Gods people, next under God himself, that is to say, the
 14459	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHead of the Church in all times, are to be consulted, what doctrine
 14460	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the hath established, before wee give credit to a pretended Miracle, or
 14461	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tProphet. And when that is done, the thing they pretend to be a Miracle,
 14462	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twe must both see it done, and use all means possible to consider,
 14463	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhether it be really done; and not onely so, but whether it be such, as
 14464	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tno man can do the like by his naturall power, but that it requires the
 14465	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\timmediate hand of God. And in this also we must have recourse to Gods
 14466	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLieutenant; to whom in all doubtfull cases, wee have submitted our
 14467	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprivate judgments. For Example; if a man pretend, that after certain
 14468	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twords spoken over a peece of bread, that presently God hath made it not
 14469	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbread, but a God, or a man, or both, and neverthelesse it looketh still
 14470	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas like bread as ever it did; there is no reason for any man to think
 14471	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit really done; nor consequently to fear him, till he enquire of God,
 14472	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby his Vicar, or Lieutenant, whether it be done, or not. If he say not,
 14473	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthen followeth that which Moses saith, (Deut. 18. 22.) "he hath spoken
 14474	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit presumptuously, thou shalt not fear him." If he say 'tis done, then
 14475	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the is not to contradict it. So also if wee see not, but onely hear tell
 14476	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof a Miracle, we are to consult the Lawful Church; that is to say, the
 14477	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlawful Head thereof, how far we are to give credit to the relators of
 14478	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit. And this is chiefly the case of men, that in these days live under
 14479	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChristian Soveraigns. For in these times, I do not know one man, that
 14480	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tever saw any such wondrous work, done by the charm, or at the word,
 14481	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor prayer of a man, that a man endued but with a mediocrity of reason,
 14482	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twould think supernaturall: and the question is no more, whether what wee
 14483	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsee done, be a Miracle; whether the Miracle we hear, or read of, were
 14484	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta reall work, and not the Act of a tongue, or pen; but in plain terms,
 14485	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhether the report be true, or a lye. In which question we are not every
 14486	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tone, to make our own private Reason, or Conscience, but the Publique
 14487	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tReason, that is, the reason of Gods Supreme Lieutenant, Judge; and
 14488	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tindeed we have made him Judge already, if wee have given him a Soveraign
 14489	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpower, to doe all that is necessary for our peace and defence. A private
 14490	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman has alwaies the liberty, (because thought is free,) to beleeve,
 14491	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor not beleeve in his heart, those acts that have been given out for
 14492	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMiracles, according as he shall see, what benefit can accrew by
 14493	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmens belief, to those that pretend, or countenance them, and thereby
 14494	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconjecture, whether they be Miracles, or Lies. But when it comes
 14495	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto confession of that faith, the Private Reason must submit to the
 14496	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPublique; that is to say, to Gods Lieutenant. But who is this Lieutenant
 14497	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof God, and Head of the Church, shall be considered in its proper place

 14509	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tresiding in them that have the Soveraignty of the Common-wealth; It
 14510	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis impossible a Common-wealth should stand, where any other than the
 14511	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign, hath a power of giving greater rewards than Life; and of
 14512	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinflicting greater punishments than Death. Now seeing Eternall Life is
 14513	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta greater reward, than the Life Present; and Eternall Torment a greater
 14514	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpunishment than the Death of Nature; It is a thing worthy to be well
 14515	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsidered, of all men that desire (by obeying Authority) to avoid
 14516	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe calamities of Confusion, and Civill war, what is meant in Holy
 14517	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tScripture, by Life Eternall, and Torment Eternall; and for what
 14518	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\toffences, against whom committed, men are to be Eternally Tormented; and

 14524	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPlace Of Adams Eternity If He Had Not Sinned, The Terrestrial Paradise
 14525	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14526	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd first we find, that Adam was created in such a condition of life,
 14527	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas had he not broken the commandement of God, he had enjoyed it in the
 14528	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tParadise of Eden Everlastingly. For there was the Tree of Life; whereof
 14529	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the was so long allowed to eat, as he should forbear to eat of the tree
 14530	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Knowledge of Good an Evill; which was not allowed him. And therefore
 14531	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas soon as he had eaten of it, God thrust him out of Paradise, "lest he
 14532	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshould put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and live
 14533	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor ever." (Gen. 3. 22.) By which it seemeth to me, (with submission
 14534	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tneverthelesse both in this, and in all questions, whereof the
 14535	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdetermination dependeth on the Scriptures, to the interpretation of the
 14536	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBible authorized by the Common-wealth, whose Subject I am,) that Adam if
 14537	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the had not sinned, had had an Eternall Life on Earth: and that Mortality
 14538	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tentred upon himself, and his posterity, by his first Sin. Not that
 14539	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tactuall Death then entred; for Adam then could never have had children;
 14540	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhereas he lived long after, and saw a numerous posterity ere he dyed.
 14541	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut where it is said, "In the day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt
 14542	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsurely die," it must needs bee meant of his Mortality, and certitude
 14543	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof death. Seeing then Eternall life was lost by Adams forfeiture, in
 14544	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommitting sin, he that should cancell that forfeiture was to recover
 14545	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthereby, that Life again. Now Jesus Christ hath satisfied for the sins
 14546	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof all that beleeve in him; and therefore recovered to all beleevers,
 14547	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat ETERNALL LIFE, which was lost by the sin of Adam. And in this sense
 14548	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit is, that the comparison of St. Paul holdeth (Rom. 5.18, 19.) "As by
 14549	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe offence of one, Judgment came upon all men to condemnation, even
 14550	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tso by the righteousnesse of one, the free gift came upon all men
 14551	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto Justification of Life." Which is again (1 Cor. 15.21,22) more
 14552	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tperspicuously delivered in these words, "For since by man came death, by
 14553	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even
 14554	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tso in Christ shall all be made alive."

 14559	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTexts Concerning The Place Of Life Eternall For Beleevers
 14560	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14561	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConcerning the place wherein men shall enjoy that Eternall Life, which
 14562	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChrist hath obtained for them, the texts next before alledged seem to
 14563	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmake it on Earth. For if as in Adam, all die, that is, have forfeited
 14564	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tParadise, and Eternall Life on Earth; even so in Christ all shall be
 14565	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmade alive; then all men shall be made to live on Earth; for else
 14566	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe comparison were not proper. Hereunto seemeth to agree that of the
 14567	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPsalmist, (Psal. 133.3.) "Upon Zion God commanded the blessing, even
 14568	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLife for evermore;" for Zion, is in Jerusalem, upon Earth: as also that
 14569	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof S. Joh. (Rev. 2.7.) "To him that overcommeth I will give to eat of
 14570	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe tree of life, which is in the midst of the Paradise of God." This
 14571	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas the tree of Adams Eternall life; but his life was to have been on
 14572	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEarth. The same seemeth to be confirmed again by St. Joh. (Rev. 21.2.)
 14573	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhere he saith, "I John saw the Holy City, New Jerusalem, coming down
 14574	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom God out of heaven, prepared as a Bride adorned for her husband:"
 14575	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand again v. 10. to the same effect: As if he should say, the new
 14576	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJerusalem, the Paradise of God, at the coming again of Christ, should
 14577	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcome down to Gods people from Heaven, and not they goe up to it from
 14578	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEarth. And this differs nothing from that, which the two men in white
 14579	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tclothing (that is, the two Angels) said to the Apostles, that were
 14580	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlooking upon Christ ascending (Acts 1.11.) "This same Jesus, who is
 14581	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttaken up from you into Heaven, shall so come, as you have seen him go up
 14582	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinto Heaven." Which soundeth as if they had said, he should come down
 14583	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto govern them under his Father, Eternally here; and not take them up
 14584	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto govern them in Heaven; and is conformable to the Restauration of the
 14585	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKingdom of God, instituted under Moses; which was a Political government
 14586	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Jews on Earth. Again, that saying of our Saviour (Mat. 22.30.)
 14587	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"that in the Resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage,
 14588	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut are as the Angels of God in heaven," is a description of an Eternall
 14589	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLife, resembling that which we lost in Adam in the point of Marriage.
 14590	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor seeing Adam, and Eve, if they had not sinned, had lived on Earth
 14591	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEternally, in their individuall persons; it is manifest, they should
 14592	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot continually have procreated their kind. For if Immortals should have
 14593	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgenerated, as Mankind doth now; the Earth in a small time, would not
 14594	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave been able to afford them a place to stand on. The Jews that asked
 14595	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tour Saviour the question, whose wife the woman that had married many
 14596	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbrothers, should be, in the resurrection, knew not what were the
 14597	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsequences of Immortality; that there shal be no Generation, and
 14598	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsequently no marriage, no more than there is Marriage, or generation
 14599	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tamong the Angels. The comparison between that Eternall life which Adam
 14600	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlost, and our Saviour by his Victory over death hath recovered; holdeth
 14601	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talso in this, that as Adam lost Eternall Life by his sin, and yet lived
 14602	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tafter it for a time; so the faithful Christian hath recovered Eternal
 14603	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLife by Christs passion, though he die a natural death, and remaine dead
 14604	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor a time; namely, till the Resurrection. For as Death is reckoned from
 14605	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Condemnation of Adam, not from the Execution; so life is reckoned
 14606	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom the Absolution, not from the Resurrection of them that are elected
 14607	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin Christ.

 14612	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAscension Into Heaven
 14613	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14614	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThat the place wherein men are to live Eternally, after the
 14615	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tResurrection, is the Heavens, meaning by Heaven, those parts of the
 14616	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tworld, which are the most remote from Earth, as where the stars are,
 14617	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor above the stars, in another Higher Heaven, called Caelum Empyreum,
 14618	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(whereof there is no mention in Scripture, nor ground in Reason) is not
 14619	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teasily to be drawn from any text that I can find. By the Kingdome of
 14620	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHeaven, is meant the Kingdome of the King that dwelleth in Heaven; and
 14621	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this Kingdome was the people of Israel, whom he ruled by the Prophets
 14622	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this Lieutenants, first Moses, and after him Eleazar, and the Soveraign
 14623	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPriests, till in the days of Samuel they rebelled, and would have a
 14624	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmortall man for their King, after the manner of other Nations. And
 14625	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhen our Saviour Christ, by the preaching of his Ministers, shall have
 14626	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tperswaded the Jews to return, and called the Gentiles to his obedience,
 14627	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthen shall there be a new Kingdome of Heaven, because our King shall
 14628	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthen be God, whose Throne is Heaven; without any necessity evident in
 14629	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Scripture, that man shall ascend to his happinesse any higher than
 14630	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGods Footstool the Earth. On the contrary, we find written (Joh. 3.13.)
 14631	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat "no man hath ascended into Heaven, but he that came down from
 14632	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHeaven, even the Son of man, that is in Heaven." Where I observe by the
 14633	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tway, that these words are not, as those which go immediately before, the
 14634	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twords of our Saviour, but of St. John himself; for Christ was then not
 14635	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin Heaven, but upon the Earth. The like is said of David (Acts 2.34.)
 14636	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhere St. Peter, to prove the Ascension of Christ, using the words of
 14637	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Psalmist, (Psal. 16.10.) "Thou wilt not leave my soule in Hell, nor
 14638	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuffer thine Holy one to see corruption," saith, they were spoken (not
 14639	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof David, but) of Christ; and to prove it, addeth this Reason, "For
 14640	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDavid is not ascended into Heaven." But to this a man may easily answer,
 14641	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand say, that though their bodies were not to ascend till the generall
 14642	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tday of Judgment, yet their souls were in Heaven as soon as they were
 14643	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdeparted from their bodies; which also seemeth to be confirmed by the
 14644	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twords of our Saviour (Luke 20.37,38.) who proving the Resurrection out
 14645	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the word of Moses, saith thus, "That the dead are raised, even Moses
 14646	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshewed, at the bush, when he calleth the Lord, the God of Abraham, and
 14647	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. For he is not a God of the Dead,
 14648	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut of the Living; for they all live to him." But if these words be to
 14649	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe understood only of the Immortality of the Soul, they prove not at all
 14650	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat which our Saviour intended to prove, which was the Resurrection
 14651	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Body, that is to say, the Immortality of the Man. Therefore our
 14652	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSaviour meaneth, that those Patriarchs were Immortall; not by a property
 14653	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsequent to the essence, and nature of mankind, but by the will of
 14654	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod, that was pleased of his mere grace, to bestow Eternall Life upon
 14655	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe faithfull. And though at that time the Patriarchs and many other
 14656	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfaithfull men were Dead, yet as it is in the text, they Lived To God;
 14657	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat is, they were written in the Book of Life with them that were
 14658	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tabsolved of their sinnes, and ordained to Life eternall at the
 14659	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tResurrection. That the Soul of man is in its own nature Eternall, and
 14660	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta living Creature independent on the Body; or that any meer man is
 14661	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tImmortall, otherwise than by the Resurrection in the last day, (except
 14662	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEnos and Elias,) is a doctrine not apparent in Scripture. The whole 14.
 14663	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChapter of Job, which is the speech not of his friends, but of himselfe,
 14664	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis a complaint of this Mortality of Nature; and yet no contradiction of
 14665	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Immortality at the Resurrection. "There is hope of a tree," (saith
 14666	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thee verse 7.) "if it be cast down, Though the root thereof wax old, and
 14667	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe stock thereof die in the ground, yet when it scenteth the water
 14668	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit will bud, and bring forth boughes like a Plant. But man dyeth, and
 14669	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twasteth away, yea, man giveth up the Ghost, and where is he?" and (verse
 14670	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t12.) "man lyeth down, and riseth not, till the heavens be no more." But
 14671	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhen is it, that the heavens shall be no more? St. Peter tells us, that
 14672	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit is at the generall Resurrection. For in his 2. Epistle, 3. Chapter,
 14673	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand 7. verse, he saith, that "the Heavens and the Earth that are now,
 14674	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare reserved unto fire against the day of Judgment, and perdition of
 14675	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tungodly men," and (verse 12.) "looking for, and hasting to the comming
 14676	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof God, wherein the Heavens shall be on fire, and shall be dissolved,
 14677	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand the Elements shall melt with fervent heat. Neverthelesse, we
 14678	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\taccording to the promise look for new Heavens, and a new Earth, wherein
 14679	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdwelleth righteousnesse." Therefore where Job saith, man riseth not till
 14680	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Heavens be no more; it is all one, as if he had said, the Immortall
 14681	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLife (and Soule and Life in the Scripture, do usually signifie the same
 14682	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthing) beginneth not in man, till the Resurrection, and day of Judgment;
 14683	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand hath for cause, not his specificall nature, and generation; but the
 14684	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPromise. For St. Peter saies not, "Wee look for new heavens, and a new
 14685	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tearth, (from Nature) but from Promise."
 14686	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14687	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLastly, seeing it hath been already proved out of divers evident places
 14688	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Scripture, in the 35. chapter of this book, that the Kingdom of God
 14689	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis a Civil Common-wealth, where God himself is Soveraign, by vertue
 14690	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfirst of the Old, and since of the New Covenant, wherein he reigneth by
 14691	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this Vicar, or Lieutenant; the same places do therefore also prove, that
 14692	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tafter the comming again of our Saviour in his Majesty, and glory, to
 14693	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treign actually, and Eternally; the Kingdom of God is to be on Earth. But
 14694	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbecause this doctrine (though proved out of places of Scripture not few,
 14695	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnor obscure) will appear to most men a novelty; I doe but propound
 14696	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit; maintaining nothing in this, or any other paradox of Religion;
 14697	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut attending the end of that dispute of the sword, concerning the
 14698	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAuthority, (not yet amongst my Countrey-men decided,) by which all sorts
 14699	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof doctrine are to bee approved, or rejected; and whose commands, both
 14700	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin speech, and writing, (whatsoever be the opinions of private men) must
 14701	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby all men, that mean to be protected by their Laws, be obeyed. For
 14702	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe points of doctrine concerning the Kingdome (of) God, have so great
 14703	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinfluence on the Kingdome of Man, as not to be determined, but by them,
 14704	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat under God have the Soveraign Power.
 14705	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14706	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14707	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14708	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14709	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Place After Judgment, Of Those Who Were Never In The Kingdome
 14710	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14711	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf God, Or Having Been In, Are Cast Out
 14712	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14713	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAs the Kingdome of God, and Eternall Life, so also Gods Enemies, and
 14714	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir Torments after Judgment, appear by the Scripture, to have their
 14715	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tplace on Earth. The name of the place, where all men remain till the
 14716	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tResurrection, that were either buryed, or swallowed up of the Earth, is
 14717	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tusually called in Scripture, by words that signifie Under Ground; which
 14718	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Latines read generally Infernus, and Inferni, and the Greeks Hades;
 14719	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat is to say, a place where men cannot see; and containeth as well the
 14720	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGrave, as any other deeper place. But for the place of the damned after
 14721	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Resurrection, it is not determined, neither in the Old, nor New
 14722	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTestament, by any note of situation; but onely by the company: as that
 14723	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit shall bee, where such wicked men were, as God in former times in
 14724	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\textraordinary, and miraculous manner, had destroyed from off the face of
 14725	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Earth: As for Example, that they are in Inferno, in Tartarus, or in
 14726	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe bottomelesse pit; because Corah, Dathan, and Abirom, were swallowed
 14727	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tup alive into the earth. Not that the Writers of the Scripture would
 14728	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave us beleeve, there could be in the globe of the Earth, which is
 14729	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot only finite, but also (compared to the height of the Stars) of no
 14730	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsiderable magnitude, a pit without a bottome; that is, a hole of
 14731	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinfinite depth, such as the Greeks in their Daemonologie (that is to
 14732	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsay, in their doctrine concerning Daemons,) and after them, the Romans
 14733	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcalled Tartarus; of which Virgill sayes,
 14734	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14735	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t    Bis patet in praeceps, tantem tenditque sub umbras,
 14736	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t    Quantus ad aethereum coeli suspectus Olympum:
 14737	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14738	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor that is a thing the proportion of Earth to Heaven cannot bear: but
 14739	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat wee should beleeve them there, indefinitely, where those men are,
 14740	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ton whom God inflicted that Exemplary punnishment.
 14741	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14742	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14743	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14744	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14745	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Congregation Of Giants
 14746	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14747	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAgain, because those mighty men of the Earth, that lived in the time
 14748	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Noah, before the floud, (which the Greeks called Heroes, and the
 14749	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tScripture Giants, and both say, were begotten, by copulation of the
 14750	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tchildren of God, with the children of men,) were for their wicked life
 14751	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdestroyed by the generall deluge; the place of the Damned, is therefore
 14752	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talso sometimes marked out, by the company of those deceased Giants; as
 14753	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tProverbs 21.16. "The man that wandreth out of the way of understanding,
 14754	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshall remain in the congregation of the Giants," and Job 26.5. "Behold
 14755	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Giants groan under water, and they that dwell with them." Here
 14756	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe place of the Damned, is under the water. And Isaiah 14.9. "Hell is
 14757	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttroubled how to meet thee," (that is, the King of Babylon) "and will
 14758	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdisplace the Giants for thee:" and here again the place of the Damned,
 14759	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(if the sense be literall,) is to be under water.
 14760	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14761	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14762	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14763	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14764	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLake Of Fire
 14765	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14766	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThirdly, because the Cities of Sodom, and Gomorrah, by the extraordinary
 14767	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twrath of God, were consumed for their wickednesse with Fire and
 14768	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBrimstone, and together with them the countrey about made a stinking
 14769	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbituminous Lake; the place of the Damned is sometimes expressed by
 14770	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFire, and a Fiery Lake: as in the Apocalypse ch.21.8. "But the timorous,
 14771	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tincredulous, and abominable, and Murderers, and Whoremongers, and
 14772	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSorcerers, and Idolators, and all Lyars, shall have their part in the
 14773	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLake that burneth with Fire, and Brimstone; which is the second Death."
 14774	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSo that it is manifest, that Hell Fire, which is here expressed by
 14775	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMetaphor, from the reall Fire of Sodome, signifieth not any certain
 14776	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tkind, or place of Torment; but is to be taken indefinitely, for
 14777	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDestruction, as it is in the 20. Chapter, at the 14. verse; where it is
 14778	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsaid, that "Death and Hell were cast into the Lake of Fire;" that is
 14779	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto say, were abolished, and destroyed; as if after the day of Judgment,
 14780	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere shall be no more Dying, nor no more going into Hell; that is, no
 14781	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmore going to Hades (from which word perhaps our word Hell is derived,)
 14782	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich is the same with no more Dying.
 14783	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14784	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14785	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14786	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14787	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tUtter Darknesse
 14788	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14789	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFourthly, from the Plague of Darknesse inflicted on the Egyptians, of
 14790	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich it is written (Exod. 10.23.) "They saw not one another, neither
 14791	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trose any man from his place for three days; but all the Children of
 14792	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIsrael had light in their dwellings;" the place of the wicked after
 14793	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJudgment, is called Utter Darknesse, or (as it is in the originall)
 14794	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDarknesse Without. And so it is expressed (Mat. 22.13.) where the King
 14795	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommandeth his Servants, "to bind hand and foot the man that had not
 14796	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ton his Wedding garment, and to cast him out," Eis To Skotos To Exoteron,
 14797	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tExternall Darknesse, or Darknesse Without: which though translated Utter
 14798	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDarknesse, does not signifie How Great, but Where that darknesse is to
 14799	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe; namely, Without The Habitation of Gods Elect.
 14800	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14801	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14802	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14803	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14804	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGehenna, And Tophet
 14805	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14806	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLastly, whereas there was a place neer Jerusalem, called the Valley of
 14807	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Children of Hinnon; in a part whereof, called Tophet, the Jews had
 14808	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommitted most grievous Idolatry, sacrificing their children to the
 14809	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIdol Moloch; and wherein also God had afflicted his enemies with most
 14810	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgrievous punishments; and wherein Josias had burnt the Priests of Moloch
 14811	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tupon their own Altars, as appeareth at large in the 2 of Kings chap. 23.
 14812	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe place served afterwards, to receive the filth, and garbage which was
 14813	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcarried thither, out of the City; and there used to be fires made, from
 14814	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttime to time, to purifie the aire, and take away the stench of Carrion.
 14815	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFrom this abominable place, the Jews used ever after to call the place
 14816	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Damned, by the name of Gehenna, or Valley of Hinnon. And this
 14817	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGehenna, is that word, which is usually now translated HELL; and
 14818	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom the fires from time to time there burning, we have the notion of
 14819	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEverlasting, and Unquenchable Fire.

 14823	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14824	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf The Literall Sense Of The Scripture Concerning Hell
 14825	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14826	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSeeing now there is none, that so interprets the Scripture, as that
 14827	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tafter the day of Judgment, the wicked are all Eternally to be punished
 14828	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the Valley of Hinnon; or that they shall so rise again, as to be ever
 14829	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tafter under ground, or under water; or that after the Resurrection, they
 14830	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshall no more see one another; nor stir from one place to another; it
 14831	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfolloweth, me thinks, very necessarily, that that which is thus said
 14832	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconcerning Hell Fire, is spoken metaphorically; and that therefore there
 14833	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis a proper sense to bee enquired after, (for of all Metaphors there is
 14834	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsome reall ground, that may be expressed in proper words) both of the
 14835	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPlace of Hell, and the nature of Hellish Torment, and Tormenters.
 14836	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14837	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14838	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14839	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14840	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSatan, Devill, Not Proper Names, But Appellatives
 14841	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14842	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd first for the Tormenters, wee have their nature, and properties,
 14843	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texactly and properly delivered by the names of, The Enemy, or Satan;
 14844	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Accuser, or Diabolus; The Destroyer, or Abbadon. Which significant
 14845	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnames, Satan, Devill, Abbadon, set not forth to us any Individuall
 14846	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tperson, as proper names use to doe; but onely an office, or quality;
 14847	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand are therefore Appellatives; which ought not to have been left
 14848	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tuntranslated, as they are, in the Latine, and Modern Bibles; because
 14849	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthereby they seem to be the proper names of Daemons; and men are the
 14850	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmore easily seduced to beleeve the doctrine of Devills; which at that
 14851	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttime was the Religion of the Gentiles, and contrary to that of Moses,
 14852	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand of Christ.
 14853	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14854	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd because by the Enemy, the Accuser, and Destroyer, is meant, the
 14855	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEnemy of them that shall be in the Kingdome of God; therefore if the
 14856	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKingdome of God after the Resurrection, bee upon the Earth, (as in the
 14857	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tformer Chapter I have shewn by Scripture it seems to be,) The Enemy,
 14858	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand his Kingdome must be on Earth also. For so also was it, in the time
 14859	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbefore the Jews had deposed God. For Gods Kingdome was in Palestine;
 14860	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand the Nations round about, were the Kingdomes of the Enemy; and
 14861	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsequently by Satan, is meant any Earthly Enemy of the Church.

 14866	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTorments Of Hell
 14867	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14868	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Torments of Hell, are expressed sometimes, by "weeping, and gnashing
 14869	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof teeth," as Mat. 8.12. Sometimes, by "the worm of Conscience;" as
 14870	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIsa.66.24. and Mark 9.44, 46, 48; sometimes, by Fire, as in the place
 14871	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnow quoted, "where the worm dyeth not, and the fire is not quenched,"
 14872	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand many places beside: sometimes by "Shame, and contempt," as Dan.
 14873	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t12.2. "And many of them that sleep in the dust of the Earth, shall
 14874	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tawake; some to Everlasting life; and some to shame, and everlasting
 14875	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontempt." All which places design metaphorically a grief, and
 14876	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdiscontent of mind, from the sight of that Eternall felicity in others,
 14877	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich they themselves through their own incredulity, and disobedience
 14878	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave lost. And because such felicity in others, is not sensible but by
 14879	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcomparison with their own actuall miseries; it followeth that they are
 14880	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto suffer such bodily paines, and calamities, as are incident to those,
 14881	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twho not onely live under evill and cruell Governours, but have also for
 14882	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEnemy, the Eternall King of the Saints, God Almighty. And amongst these
 14883	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbodily paines, is to be reckoned also to every one of the wicked a
 14884	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsecond Death. For though the Scripture bee clear for an universall
 14885	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tResurrection; yet wee do not read, that to any of the Reprobate is
 14886	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpromised an Eternall life. For whereas St. Paul (1 Cor. 15.42, 43.) to
 14887	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe question concerning what bodies men shall rise with again, saith,
 14888	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat "the body is sown in corruption, and is raised in incorruption; It
 14889	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weaknesse, it
 14890	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis raised in power;" Glory and Power cannot be applyed to the bodies of
 14891	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe wicked: Nor can the name of Second Death, bee applyed to those
 14892	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat can never die but once: And although in Metaphoricall speech, a
 14893	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCalamitous life Everlasting, may bee called an Everlasting Death yet it
 14894	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcannot well be understood of a Second Death. The fire prepared for the
 14895	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twicked, is an Everlasting Fire: that is to say, the estate wherein
 14896	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tno man can be without torture, both of body and mind, after the
 14897	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tResurrection, shall endure for ever; and in that sense the Fire shall
 14898	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe unquenchable, and the torments Everlasting: but it cannot thence be
 14899	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinferred, that hee who shall be cast into that fire, or be tormented
 14900	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith those torments, shall endure, and resist them so, as to be
 14901	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teternally burnt, and tortured, and yet never be destroyed, nor die. And
 14902	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthough there be many places that affirm Everlasting Fire, and Torments
 14903	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(into which men may be cast successively one after another for ever;)
 14904	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tyet I find none that affirm there shall bee an Eternall Life therein of
 14905	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tany individuall person; but on the contrary, an Everlasting Death, which
 14906	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis the Second Death: (Apoc. 20. 13,14.) "For after Death, and the Grave
 14907	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshall have delivered up the dead which were in them, and every man be
 14908	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tjudged according to his works; Death and the Grave shall also be cast
 14909	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinto the Lake of Fire. This is the Second Death." Whereby it is
 14910	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevident, that there is to bee a Second Death of every one that shall bee
 14911	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcondemned at the day of Judgement, after which hee shall die no more.

 14916	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Joyes Of Life Eternall, And Salvation The Same Thing,
 14917	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14918	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSalvation From Sin, And From Misery, All One
 14919	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14920	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe joyes of Life Eternall, are in Scripture comprehended all under the
 14921	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tname of SALVATION, or Being Saved. To be saved, is to be secured, either
 14922	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trespectively, against speciall Evills, or absolutely against all Evill,
 14923	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcomprehending Want, Sicknesse, and Death it self. And because man
 14924	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas created in a condition Immortall, not subject to corruption, and
 14925	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsequently to nothing that tendeth to the dissolution of his nature;
 14926	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand fell from that happinesse by the sin of Adam; it followeth, that
 14927	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto be Saved From Sin, is to be saved from all the Evill, and Calamities
 14928	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat Sinne hath brought upon us. And therefore in the Holy Scripture,
 14929	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRemission of Sinne, and Salvation from Death and Misery, is the same
 14930	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthing, as it appears by the words of our Saviour, who having cured a man
 14931	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsick of the Palsey, by saying, (Mat. 9.2.) "Son be of good cheer, thy
 14932	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSins be forgiven thee;" and knowing that the Scribes took for blasphemy,
 14933	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat a man should pretend to forgive Sins, asked them (v.5.) "whether
 14934	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit were easier to say, Thy Sinnes be forgiven thee, or, Arise and walk;"
 14935	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsignifying thereby, that it was all one, as to the saving of the sick,
 14936	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto say, "Thy Sins are forgiven," and "Arise and walk;" and that he used
 14937	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat form of speech, onely to shew he had power to forgive Sins. And
 14938	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit is besides evident in reason, that since Death and Misery, were the
 14939	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpunishments of Sin, the discharge of Sinne, must also be a discharge
 14940	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Death and Misery; that is to say, Salvation absolute, such as the
 14941	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfaithfull are to enjoy after the day of Judgment, by the power, and
 14942	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfavour of Jesus Christ, who for that cause is called our SAVIOUR.
 14943	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14944	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConcerning Particular Salvations, such as are understood, 1 Sam. 14.39.
 14945	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"as the Lord liveth that saveth Israel," that is, from their temporary
 14946	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tenemies, and 2 Sam. 22.4. "Thou art my Saviour, thou savest me from
 14947	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tviolence;" and 2 Kings 13.5. "God gave the Israelites a Saviour, and
 14948	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tso they were delivered from the hand of the Assyrians," and the like,
 14949	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tI need say nothing; there being neither difficulty, nor interest, to
 14950	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcorrupt the interpretation of texts of that kind.

 14955	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Place Of Eternall Salvation
 14956	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14957	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut concerning the Generall Salvation, because it must be in the
 14958	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKingdome of Heaven, there is great difficulty concerning the Place.
 14959	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOn one side, by Kingdome (which is an estate ordained by men for their
 14960	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tperpetuall security against enemies, and want) it seemeth that this
 14961	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSalvation should be on Earth. For by Salvation is set forth unto us,
 14962	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta glorious Reign of our King, by Conquest; not a safety by Escape:
 14963	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand therefore there where we look for Salvation, we must look also
 14964	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor Triumph; and before Triumph, for Victory; and before Victory, for
 14965	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBattell; which cannot well be supposed, shall be in Heaven. But how good
 14966	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsoever this reason may be, I will not trust to it, without very evident
 14967	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tplaces of Scripture. The state of Salvation is described at large,
 14968	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIsaiah, 33. ver. 20,21,22,23,24.
 14969	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14970	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"Look upon Zion, the City of our solemnities, thine eyes shall see
 14971	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that shall not be taken down;
 14972	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed, neither shall any
 14973	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the cords thereof be broken.
 14974	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14975	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut there the glorious Lord will be unto us a place of broad rivers, and
 14976	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tstreams; wherein shall goe no Gally with oares; neither shall gallant
 14977	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tship passe thereby.
 14978	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14979	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor the Lord is our Judge, the Lord is our Lawgiver, the Lord is our

 14986	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd the Inhabitant shall not say, I am sicke; the people that shall

 14988	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 14989	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn which words wee have the place from whence Salvation is to proceed,
 14990	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"Jerusalem, a quiet habitation;" the Eternity of it, "a tabernacle that
 14991	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshall not be taken down," &c. The Saviour of it, "the Lord, their Judge,
 14992	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir Lawgiver, their King, he will save us;" the Salvation, "the Lord
 14993	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshall be to them as a broad mote of swift waters," &c. the condition of
 14994	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir Enemies, "their tacklings are loose, their masts weake, the
 14995	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlame shal take the spoil of them." The condition of the Saved,
 14996	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"The Inhabitants shall not say, I am sick:" And lastly, all this is
 14997	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcomprehended in Forgivenesse of sin, "The people that dwell therein
 14998	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshall be forgiven their iniquity." By which it is evident, that
 14999	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSalvation shall be on Earth, then, when God shall reign, (at the coming
 15000	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagain of Christ) in Jerusalem; and from Jerusalem shall proceed the
 15001	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSalvation of the Gentiles that shall be received into Gods Kingdome; as
 15002	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis also more expressely declared by the same Prophet, Chap. 66.20, 21.
 15003	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"And they," (that is, the Gentiles who had any Jew in bondage) "shall
 15004	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbring all your brethren, for an offering to the Lord, out of all
 15005	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnations, upon horses, and in charets, and in litters, and upon mules,
 15006	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand upon swift beasts, to my holy mountain, Jerusalem, saith the Lord,
 15007	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas the Children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessell into
 15008	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe House of the Lord. And I will also take of them for Priests and for
 15009	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLevites, saith the Lord:" Whereby it is manifest, that the chief seat of
 15010	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGods Kingdome (which is the Place, from whence the Salvation of us that
 15011	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere Gentiles, shall proceed) shall be Jerusalem; And the same is also
 15012	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconfirmed by our Saviour, in his discourse with the woman of Samaria,
 15013	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconcerning the place of Gods worship; to whom he saith, John 4.22. that
 15014	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Samaritans worshipped they know not what, but the Jews worship what
 15015	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey knew, "For Salvation is of the Jews (Ex Judais, that is, begins at
 15016	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Jews): as if he should say, you worship God, but know not by whom
 15017	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the wil save you, as we doe, that know it shall be one of the tribe
 15018	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Judah, a Jew, not a Samaritan. And therefore also the woman not
 15019	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\timpertinently answered him again, "We know the Messias shall come." So
 15020	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat which our saviour saith, "Salvation is from the Jews," is the
 15021	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsame that Paul sayes (Rom. 1.16,17.) "The Gospel is the power of God to
 15022	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSalvation to every one that beleeveth; To the Jew first, and also to the
 15023	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGreek. For therein is the righteousnesse of God revealed from faith to
 15024	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfaith;" from the faith of the Jew, to the faith of the Gentile. In
 15025	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe like sense the Prophet Joel describing the day of Judgment, (chap.
 15026	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t2.30,31.) that God would "shew wonders in heaven, and in earth, bloud,
 15027	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand fire, and pillars of smoak. The Sun should be turned to darknesse,
 15028	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand the Moon into bloud, before the great and terrible day of the Lord
 15029	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcome," he addeth verse 32. "and it shall come to passe, that whosoever
 15030	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshall call upon the name of the Lord, shall be saved. For in Mount Zion,
 15031	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand in Jerusalem shall be Salvation." And Obadiah verse 17 saith
 15032	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe same, "Upon Mount Zion shall be Deliverance; and there shall be
 15033	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tholinesse, and the house of Jacob shall possesse their possessions,"
 15034	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat is, the possessions of the Heathen, which possessions he expresseth
 15035	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmore particularly in the following verses, by the Mount of Esau, the
 15036	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLand of the Philistines, the Fields of Ephraim, of Samaria, Gilead, and
 15037	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Cities of the South, and concludes with these words, "the Kingdom
 15038	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshall be the Lords." All these places are for Salvation, and the
 15039	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKingdome of God (after the day of Judgement) upon Earth. On the other
 15040	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tside, I have not found any text that can probably be drawn, to prove
 15041	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tany Ascension of the Saints into Heaven; that is to say, into any Coelum
 15042	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEmpyreum, or other aetheriall Region; saving that it is called the
 15043	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKingdome of Heaven; which name it may have, because God, that was King
 15044	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Jews, governed them by his commands, sent to Moses by Angels from
 15045	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHeaven, to reduce them to their obedience; and shall send him thence
 15046	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagain, to rule both them, and all other faithfull men, from the day of
 15047	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJudgment, Everlastingly: or from that, that the Throne of this our Great
 15048	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKing is in Heaven; whereas the Earth is but his Footstoole. But that the
 15049	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSubjects of God should have any place as high as his throne, or higher
 15050	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthan his Footstoole, it seemeth not sutable to the dignity of a King,
 15051	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnor can I find any evident text for it in holy Scripture.
 15052	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15053	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFrom this that hath been said of the Kingdom of God, and of Salvation,
 15054	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit is not hard to interpret, what is meant by the WORLD TO COME. There
 15055	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare three worlds mentioned in Scripture, the Old World, the Present
 15056	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWorld, and the World to Come. Of the first, St. Peter speaks, (2 Pet.
 15057	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t2.5.) "If God spared not the Old World, but saved Noah the eighth
 15058	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tperson, a Preacher of righteousnesse, bringing the flood upon the world
 15059	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the ungodly," &c. So the First World, was from Adam to the generall
 15060	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFlood. Of the present World, our Saviour speaks (John 18.36.) "My
 15061	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKingdome is not of this World." For he came onely to teach men the way
 15062	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Salvation, and to renew the Kingdome of his Father, by his doctrine.
 15063	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf the World to come, St. Peter speaks, (2 Pet. 3. 13.) "Neverthelesse
 15064	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twe according to his promise look for new Heavens, and a new Earth." This
 15065	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis that WORLD, wherein Christ coming down from Heaven, in the clouds,
 15066	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith great power, and glory, shall send his Angels, and shall gather
 15067	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttogether his elect, from the four winds, and from the uttermost parts
 15068	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Earth, and thence forth reign over them, (under his Father)
 15069	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEverlastingly.
 15070	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15071	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15072	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15073	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15074	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRedemption
 15075	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15076	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSalvation of a sinner, supposeth a precedent REDEMPTION; for he that is
 15077	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tonce guilty of Sin, is obnoxious to the Penalty of the same; and must
 15078	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpay (or some other for him) such Ransome, as he that is offended, and
 15079	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thas him in his power, shall require. And seeing the person offended, is
 15080	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAlmighty God, in whose power are all things; such Ransome is to be paid
 15081	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbefore Salvation can be acquired, as God hath been pleased to require.
 15082	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBy this Ransome, is not intended a satisfaction for Sin, equivalent to
 15083	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Offence, which no sinner for himselfe, nor righteous man can ever be
 15084	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\table to make for another; The dammage a man does to another, he may make
 15085	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tamends for by restitution, or recompence, but sin cannot be taken
 15086	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\taway by recompence; for that were to make the liberty to sin, a thing
 15087	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tvendible. But sins may bee pardoned to the repentant, either Gratis, or
 15088	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tupon such penalty, as God is pleased to accept. That which God usually
 15089	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\taccepted in the Old Testament, was some Sacrifice, or Oblation. To
 15090	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tforgive sin is not an act of Injustice, though the punishment have
 15091	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeen threatned. Even amongst men, though the promise of Good, bind the
 15092	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpromiser; yet threats, that is to say, promises, of Evill, bind them
 15093	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot; much lesse shall they bind God, who is infinitely more mercifull
 15094	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthen men. Our Saviour Christ therefore to Redeem us, did not in that
 15095	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsense satisfie for the Sins of men, as that his Death, of its own
 15096	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tvertue, could make it unjust in God to punish sinners with Eternall
 15097	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdeath; but did make that Sacrifice, and Oblation of himself, at his
 15098	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfirst coming, which God was pleased to require, for the Salvation at his
 15099	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsecond coming, of such as in the mean time should repent, and beleeve in
 15100	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim. And though this act of our Redemption, be not alwaies in Scripture
 15101	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcalled a Sacrifice, and Oblation, but sometimes a Price, yet by Price
 15102	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twe are not to understand any thing, by the value whereof, he could claim
 15103	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tright to a pardon for us, from his offended Father, but that Price which
 15104	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod the Father was pleased in mercy to demand.

 15114	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15115	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe word Church, (Ecclesia) signifieth in the Books of Holy Scripture
 15116	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdivers things. Sometimes (though not often) it is taken for Gods House,
 15117	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat is to say, for a Temple, wherein Christians assemble to perform
 15118	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tholy duties publiquely; as, 1 Cor. 14. ver. 34. "Let your women keep
 15119	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsilence in the Churches:" but this is Metaphorically put, for the
 15120	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCongregation there assembled; and hath been since used for the
 15121	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEdifice it self, to distinguish between the Temples of Christians, and
 15122	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIdolaters. The Temple of Jerusalem was Gods House, and the House of
 15123	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPrayer; and so is any Edifice dedicated by Christians to the worship of
 15124	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChrist, Christs House: and therefore the Greek Fathers call it Kuriake,
 15125	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Lords House; and thence, in our language it came to be called Kyrke,
 15126	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Church.

 15132	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15133	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChurch (when not taken for a House) signifieth the same that Ecclesia

 15135	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor an Assembly of Citizens, called forth, to hear the Magistrate speak
 15136	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunto them; and which in the Common-wealth of Rome was called Concio, as
 15137	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the that spake was called Ecclesiastes, and Concionator. And when they
 15138	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere called forth by lawfull Authority, (Acts 19.39.) it was Ecclesia
 15139	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLegitima, a Lawfull Church, Ennomos Ecclesia. But when they were excited
 15140	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby tumultuous, and seditious clamor, then it was a confused Church,
 15141	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEcclesia Sugkechumene.
 15142	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15143	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIt is taken also sometimes for the men that have right to be of the
 15144	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCongregation, though not actually assembled; that is to say, for the
 15145	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhole multitude of Christian men, how far soever they be dispersed: as
 15146	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(Act. 8.3.) where it is said, that "Saul made havock of the Church:" And
 15147	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin this sense is Christ said to be Head of the Church. And sometimes for
 15148	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta certain part of Christians, as (Col. 4.15.) "Salute the Church that is
 15149	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin his house." Sometimes also for the Elect onely; as (Ephes. 5.27.) "A
 15150	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGlorious Church, without spot, or wrinkle, holy, and without blemish;"
 15151	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich is meant of the Church Triumphant, or, Church To Come. Sometimes,
 15152	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor a Congregation assembled, of professors of Christianity, whether
 15153	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir profession be true, or counterfeit, as it is understood, Mat.
 15154	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t18.17. where it is said, "Tell it to the Church, and if hee neglect to
 15155	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thear the Church, let him be to thee as a Gentile, or Publican."

 15158	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15159	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15160	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn What Sense The Church Is One Person Church Defined
 15161	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15162	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd in this last sense only it is that the Church can be taken for one
 15163	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPerson; that is to say, that it can be said to have power to will, to
 15164	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpronounce, to command, to be obeyed, to make laws, or to doe any other
 15165	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\taction whatsoever; For without authority from a lawfull Congregation,
 15166	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhatsoever act be done in a concourse of people, it is the particular
 15167	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tact of every one of those that were present, and gave their aid to the
 15168	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tperformance of it; and not the act of them all in grosse, as of one
 15169	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbody; much lesse that act of them that were absent, or that being
 15170	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpresent, were not willing it should be done. According to this sense, I
 15171	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdefine a CHURCH to be, "A company of men professing Christian Religion,
 15172	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunited in the person of one Soveraign; at whose command they ought to
 15173	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tassemble, and without whose authority they ought not to assemble." And
 15174	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbecause in all Common-wealths, that Assembly, which is without warrant
 15175	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom the Civil Soveraign, is unlawful; that Church also, which is
 15176	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tassembled in any Common-wealth, that hath forbidden them to assemble, is
 15177	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tan unlawfull Assembly.
 15178	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15179	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15180	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15181	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15182	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tA Christian Common-wealth, And A Church All One
 15183	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15184	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIt followeth also, that there is on Earth, no such universall Church as
 15185	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall Christians are bound to obey; because there is no power on Earth, to
 15186	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich all other Common-wealths are subject: There are Christians, in
 15187	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Dominions of severall Princes and States; but every one of them
 15188	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis subject to that Common-wealth, whereof he is himself a member; and
 15189	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsequently, cannot be subject to the commands of any other Person.
 15190	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd therefore a Church, such as one as is capable to Command, to Judge,
 15191	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAbsolve, Condemn, or do any other act, is the same thing with a Civil
 15192	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth, consisting of Christian men; and is called a Civill
 15193	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tState, for that the subjects of it are Men; and a Church, for that the
 15194	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsubjects thereof are Christians. Temporall and Spirituall Government,
 15195	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare but two words brought into the world, to make men see double, and
 15196	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmistake their Lawfull Soveraign. It is true, that the bodies of the
 15197	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfaithfull, after the Resurrection shall be not onely Spirituall, but
 15198	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEternall; but in this life they are grosse, and corruptible. There
 15199	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis therefore no other Government in this life, neither of State, nor
 15200	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tReligion, but Temporall; nor teaching of any doctrine, lawfull to any
 15201	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSubject, which the Governour both of the State, and of the Religion,
 15202	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tforbiddeth to be taught: And that Governor must be one; or else there
 15203	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmust needs follow Faction, and Civil war in the Common-wealth, between
 15204	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Church and State; between Spiritualists, and Temporalists; between
 15205	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Sword Of Justice, and the Shield Of Faith; and (which is more) in
 15206	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevery Christian mans own brest, between the Christian, and the Man.
 15207	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Doctors of the Church, are called Pastors; so also are Civill
 15208	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraignes: But if Pastors be not subordinate one to another, so
 15209	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas that there may bee one chief Pastor, men will be taught contrary
 15210	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDoctrines, whereof both may be, and one must be false. Who that one
 15211	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tchief Pastor is, according to the law of Nature, hath been already
 15212	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshewn; namely, that it is the Civill Soveraign; And to whom the
 15213	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tScripture hath assigned that Office, we shall see in the Chapters
 15214	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfollowing.

 15220	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOF THE RIGHTS OF THE KINGDOME OF GOD, IN ABRAHAM, MOSES, HIGH PRIESTS,
 15221	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t

 15226	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15227	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Soveraign Rights Of Abraham
 15228	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15229	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Father of the Faithfull, and first in the Kingdome of God by
 15230	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCovenant, was Abraham. For with him was the Covenant first made; wherein
 15231	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the obliged himself, and his seed after him, to acknowledge and obey the
 15232	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommands of God; not onely such, as he could take notice of, (as Morall
 15233	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaws,) by the light of Nature; but also such, as God should in speciall
 15234	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmanner deliver to him by Dreams and Visions. For as to the Morall law,
 15235	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey were already obliged, and needed not have been contracted withall,
 15236	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby promise of the Land of Canaan. Nor was there any Contract, that could
 15237	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tadde to, or strengthen the Obligation, by which both they, and all
 15238	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen else were bound naturally to obey God Almighty: And therefore the
 15239	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCovenant which Abraham made with God, was to take for the Commandement
 15240	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof God, that which in the name of God was commanded him, in a Dream, or
 15241	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tVision, and to deliver it to his family, and cause them to observe the
 15242	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsame.
 15243	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15244	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15245	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15246	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15247	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAbraham Had The Sole Power Of Ordering The Religion Of His Own People
 15248	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15249	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn this Contract of God with Abraham, wee may observe three points of
 15250	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\timportant consequence in the government of Gods people. First, that at
 15251	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe making of this Covenant, God spake onely to Abraham; and therefore
 15252	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontracted not with any of his family, or seed, otherwise then as their
 15253	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twills (which make the essence of all Covenants) were before the Contract
 15254	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinvolved in the will of Abraham; who was therefore supposed to have had
 15255	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta lawfull power, to make them perform all that he covenanted for them.
 15256	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAccording whereunto (Gen 18.18, 19.) God saith, "All the Nations of the
 15257	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEarth shall be blessed in him, For I know him that he will command his
 15258	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tchildren and his houshold after him, and they shall keep the way of the
 15259	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLord." From whence may be concluded this first point, that they to
 15260	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhom God hath not spoken immediately, are to receive the positive
 15261	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommandements of God, from their Soveraign; as the family and seed of
 15262	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAbraham did from Abraham their Father, and Lord, and Civill Soveraign.
 15263	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd Consequently in every Common-wealth, they who have no supernaturall
 15264	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRevelation to the contrary, ought to obey the laws of their own
 15265	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign, in the externall acts and profession of Religion. As for the
 15266	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinward Thought, and beleef of men, which humane Governours can take no
 15267	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnotice of, (for God onely knoweth the heart) they are not voluntary, nor
 15268	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe effect of the laws, but of the unrevealed will, and of the power of
 15269	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod; and consequently fall not under obligation.
 15270	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15271	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15272	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15273	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15274	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNo Pretence Of Private Spirit Against The Religion Of Abraham
 15275	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15276	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFrom whence proceedeth another point, that it was not unlawfull for
 15277	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAbraham, when any of his Subjects should pretend Private Vision, or
 15278	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSpirit, or other Revelation from God, for the countenancing of any
 15279	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdoctrine which Abraham should forbid, or when they followed, or adhered
 15280	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto any such pretender, to punish them; and consequently that it is
 15281	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlawfull now for the Soveraign to punish any man that shall oppose his
 15282	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPrivate Spirit against the Laws: For hee hath the same place in the
 15283	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth, that Abraham had in his own Family.
 15284	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15285	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15286	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15287	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15288	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAbraham Sole Judge, And Interpreter Of What God Spake
 15289	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15290	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThere ariseth also from the same, a third point; that as none but
 15291	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAbraham in his family, so none but the Soveraign in a Christian
 15292	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth, can take notice what is, or what is not the Word of God.
 15293	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor God spake onely to Abraham; and it was he onely, that was able
 15294	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto know what God said, and to interpret the same to his family: And
 15295	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore also, they that have the place of Abraham in a Common-wealth,
 15296	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare the onely Interpreters of what God hath spoken.
 15297	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15298	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15299	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15300	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15301	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Authority Of Moses Whereon Grounded
 15302	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15303	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe same Covenant was renewed with Isaac; and afterwards with Jacob; but
 15304	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tafterwards no more, till the Israelites were freed from the Egyptians,
 15305	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand arrived at the Foot of Mount Sinai: and then it was renewed by Moses
 15306	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(as I have said before, chap. 35.) in such manner, as they became from
 15307	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat time forward the Peculiar Kingdome of God; whose Lieutenant was
 15308	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMoses, for his owne time; and the succession to that office was setled
 15309	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tupon Aaron, and his heirs after him, to bee to God a Sacerdotall
 15310	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKingdome for ever.
 15311	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15312	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBy this constitution, a Kingdome is acquired to God. But seeing Moses
 15313	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thad no authority to govern the Israelites, as a successor to the right
 15314	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Abraham, because he could not claim it by inheritance; it appeareth
 15315	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot as yet, that the people were obliged to take him for Gods
 15316	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLieutenant, longer than they beleeved that God spake unto him. And
 15317	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore his authority (notwithstanding the Covenant they made with
 15318	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod) depended yet merely upon the opinion they had of his Sanctity,
 15319	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand of the reality of his Conferences with God, and the verity of his
 15320	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMiracles; which opinion coming to change, they were no more obliged to
 15321	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttake any thing for the law of God, which he propounded to them in Gods
 15322	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tname. We are therefore to consider, what other ground there was, of
 15323	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir obligation to obey him. For it could not be the commandement of
 15324	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod that could oblige them; because God spake not to them immediately,
 15325	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut by the mediation of Moses Himself; And our Saviour saith of himself,
 15326	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(John 5. 31.) "If I bear witnesse of my self, my witnesse is not true,"
 15327	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmuch lesse if Moses bear witnesse of himselfe, (especially in a claim of
 15328	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKingly power over Gods people) ought his testimony to be received. His
 15329	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tauthority therefore, as the authority of all other Princes, must be
 15330	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgrounded on the Consent of the People, and their Promise to obey him.
 15331	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd so it was: for "the people" (Exod. 20.18.) "when they saw the
 15332	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThunderings, and the Lightnings, and the noyse of the Trumpet, and the
 15333	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmountaine smoaking, removed, and stood a far off. And they said unto
 15334	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMoses, speak thou with us, and we will hear, but let not God speak with
 15335	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tus lest we die." Here was their promise of obedience; and by this it was
 15336	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey obliged themselves to obey whatsoever he should deliver unto them
 15337	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor the Commandement of God.
 15338	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15339	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15340	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15341	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15342	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMoses Was (Under God) Soveraign Of The Jews, All His Own Time,
 15343	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15344	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThough Aaron Had The Priesthood
 15345	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15346	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd notwithstanding the Covenant constituted a Sacerdotall Kingdome,
 15347	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat is to say, a Kingdome hereditary to Aaron; yet that is to be
 15348	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunderstood of the succession, after Moses should bee dead. For
 15349	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhosoever ordereth, and establisheth the Policy, as first founder of
 15350	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Common-wealth (be it Monarchy, Aristocracy, or Democracy) must needs
 15351	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave Soveraign Power over the people all the while he is doing of it.
 15352	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd that Moses had that power all his own time, is evidently affirmed in
 15353	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Scripture. First, in the text last before cited, because the people
 15354	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpromised obedience, not to Aaron but to him. Secondly, (Exod. 24.1, 2.)
 15355	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"And God said unto Moses, Come up unto the Lord, thou, and Aaron, Nadab
 15356	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Abihu, and seventy of the Elders of Israel. And Moses alone shall
 15357	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcome neer the Lord, but they shall not come nigh, neither shall the
 15358	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpeople goe up with him." By which it is plain, that Moses who was alone
 15359	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcalled up to God, (and not Aaron, nor the other Priests, nor the Seventy
 15360	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tElders, nor the People who were forbidden to come up) was alone he, that
 15361	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trepresented to the Israelites the Person of God; that is to say, was
 15362	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir sole Soveraign under God. And though afterwards it be said (verse
 15363	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t9.) "Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the
 15364	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tElders of Israel, and they saw the God of Israel, and there was under
 15365	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this feet, as it were a paved work of a saphire stone," &c. yet this was
 15366	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot till after Moses had been with God before, and had brought to
 15367	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe people the words which God had said to him. He onely went for the
 15368	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbusinesse of the people; the others, as the Nobles of his retinue, were
 15369	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tadmitted for honour to that speciall grace, which was not allowed to
 15370	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe people; which was, (as in the verse after appeareth) to see God and
 15371	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlive. "God laid not his hand upon them, they saw God and did eat and
 15372	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdrink" (that is, did live), but did not carry any commandement from
 15373	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim to the people. Again, it is every where said, "The Lord spake unto
 15374	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMoses," as in all other occasions of Government; so also in the ordering
 15375	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Ceremonies of Religion, contained in the 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30,
 15376	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand 31 Chapters of Exodus, and throughout Leviticus: to Aaron seldome.
 15377	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Calfe that Aaron made, Moses threw into the fire. Lastly, the
 15378	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tquestion of the Authority of Aaron, by occasion of his and Miriams
 15379	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmutiny against Moses, was (Numbers 12.) judged by God himself for Moses.
 15380	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSo also in the question between Moses, and the People, when Corah,
 15381	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDathan, and Abiram, and two hundred and fifty Princes of the Assembly
 15382	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"gathered themselves together" (Numbers 16. 3) "against Moses, and
 15383	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagainst Aaron, and said unto them, 'Ye take too much upon you, seeing
 15384	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall the congregation are Holy, every one of them, and the Lord is
 15385	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tamongst them, why lift you up your selves above the congregation of the
 15386	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLord?'" God caused the Earth to swallow Corah, Dathan, and Abiram with
 15387	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir wives and children alive, and consumed those two hundred and fifty
 15388	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPrinces with fire. Therefore neither Aaron, nor the People, nor any
 15389	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAristocracy of the chief Princes of the People, but Moses alone had next
 15390	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunder God the Soveraignty over the Israelites: And that not onely in
 15391	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcauses of Civill Policy, but also of Religion; For Moses onely spake
 15392	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith God, and therefore onely could tell the People, what it was that
 15393	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod required at their hands. No man upon pain of death might be so
 15394	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpresumptuous as to approach the Mountain where God talked with Moses.
 15395	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"Thou shalt set bounds" (saith the Lord, Exod 19. 12.) "to the people
 15396	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tround about, and say, Take heed to your selves that you goe not up into
 15397	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Mount, or touch the border of it; whosoever toucheth the Mount shall
 15398	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsurely be put to death." and again (verse 21.) "Get down, charge the
 15399	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpeople, lest they break through unto the Lord to gaze." Out of which we
 15400	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmay conclude, that whosoever in a Christian Common-wealth holdeth the
 15401	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tplace of Moses, is the sole Messenger of God, and Interpreter of
 15402	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this Commandements. And according hereunto, no man ought in the
 15403	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinterpretation of the Scripture to proceed further then the bounds which
 15404	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare set by their severall Soveraigns. For the Scriptures since God now
 15405	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tspeaketh in them, are the Mount Sinai; the bounds whereof are the Laws
 15406	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof them that represent Gods Person on Earth. To look upon them and
 15407	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherein to behold the wondrous works of God, and learn to fear him is
 15408	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tallowed; but to interpret them; that is, to pry into what God saith to
 15409	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim whom he appointeth to govern under him, and make themselves Judges
 15410	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhether he govern as God commandeth him, or not, is to transgresse the
 15411	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbounds God hath set us, and to gaze upon God irreverently.

 15416	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAll Spirits Were Subordinate To The Spirit Of Moses
 15417	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15418	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThere was no Prophet in the time of Moses, nor pretender to the Spirit
 15419	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof God, but such as Moses had approved, and Authorized. For there were
 15420	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin his time but Seventy men, that are said to Prophecy by the Spirit of
 15421	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod, and these were of all Moses his election; concerning whom God saith
 15422	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto Moses (Numb. 11.16.) "Gather to mee Seventy of the Elders of Israel,
 15423	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhom thou knowest to be the Elders of the People." To these God imparted
 15424	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this Spirit; but it was not a different Spirit from that of Moses; for
 15425	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit is said (verse 25.) "God came down in a cloud, and took of the Spirit
 15426	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat was upon Moses, and gave it to the Seventy Elders." But as I have
 15427	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshewn before (chap. 36.) by Spirit, is understood the Mind; so that the
 15428	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsense of the place is no other than this, that God endued them with
 15429	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta mind conformable, and subordinate to that of Moses, that they might
 15430	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tProphecy, that is to say, speak to the people in Gods name, in such
 15431	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmanner, as to set forward (as Ministers of Moses, and by his authority)
 15432	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch doctrine as was agreeable to Moses his doctrine. For they were but
 15433	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMinisters; and when two of them Prophecyed in the Camp, it was thought
 15434	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta new and unlawfull thing; and as it is in the 27. and 28. verses of
 15435	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe same Chapter, they were accused of it, and Joshua advised Moses to
 15436	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tforbid them, as not knowing that it was by Moses his Spirit that they
 15437	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tProphecyed. By which it is manifest, that no Subject ought to pretend to
 15438	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tProphecy, or to the Spirit, in opposition to the doctrine established by
 15439	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim, whom God hath set in the place of Moses.

 15444	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAfter Moses The Soveraignty Was In The High Priest
 15445	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15446	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAaron being dead, and after him also Moses, the Kingdome, as being a
 15447	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSacerdotall Kingdome, descended by vertue of the Covenant, to Aarons
 15448	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSon, Eleazar the High Priest: And God declared him (next under himself)
 15449	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor Soveraign, at the same time that he appointed Joshua for the
 15450	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGenerall of their Army. For thus God saith expressely (Numb. 27.21.)
 15451	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconcerning Joshua; "He shall stand before Eleazar the Priest, who shall
 15452	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\task counsell for him, before the Lord, at his word shall they goe out,
 15453	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand at his word they shall come in, both he, and all the Children of
 15454	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIsrael with him:" Therefore the Supreme Power of making War and Peace,
 15455	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas in the Priest. The Supreme Power of Judicature belonged also to
 15456	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe High Priest: For the Book of the Law was in their keeping; and the
 15457	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPriests and Levites onely were the subordinate Judges in causes Civill,
 15458	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas appears in Deut. 17.8, 9, 10. And for the manner of Gods worship,
 15459	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere was never doubt made, but that the High Priest till the time
 15460	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Saul, had the Supreme Authority. Therefore the Civill and
 15461	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEcclesiasticall Power were both joined together in one and the same
 15462	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tperson, the High Priest; and ought to bee so, in whosoever governeth by
 15463	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDivine Right; that is, by Authority immediate from God.

 15468	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf The Soveraign Power Between The Time Of Joshua And Of Saul
 15469	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15470	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAfter the death of Joshua, till the time of Saul, the time between is
 15471	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnoted frequently in the Book of Judges, "that there was in those dayes
 15472	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tno King in Israel;" and sometimes with this addition, that "every
 15473	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman did that which was right in his own eyes." By which is to bee
 15474	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunderstood, that where it is said, "there was no King," is meant, "there
 15475	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas no Soveraign Power" in Israel. And so it was, if we consider the
 15476	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAct, and Exercise of such power. For after the death of Joshua, &
 15477	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEleazar, "there arose another generation" (Judges 2.10.) "that knew not
 15478	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Lord, nor the works which he had done for Israel, but did evill in
 15479	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe sight of the Lord, and served Baalim." And the Jews had that quality
 15480	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich St. Paul noteth, "to look for a sign," not onely before they would
 15481	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsubmit themselves to the government of Moses, but also after they had
 15482	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobliged themselves by their submission. Whereas Signs, and Miracles had
 15483	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor End to procure Faith, not to keep men from violating it, when they
 15484	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave once given it; for to that men are obliged by the law of Nature.
 15485	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut if we consider not the Exercise, but the Right of governing, the
 15486	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign power was still in the High Priest. Therefore whatsoever
 15487	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobedience was yeelded to any of the Judges, (who were men chosen by God
 15488	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\textraordinarily, to save his rebellious subjects out of the hands of
 15489	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe enemy,) it cannot bee drawn into argument against the Right the High
 15490	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPriest had to the Soveraign Power, in all matters, both of Policy and
 15491	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tReligion. And neither the Judges, nor Samuel himselfe had an ordinary,
 15492	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut extraordinary calling to the Government; and were obeyed by the
 15493	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIsraelites, not out of duty, but out of reverence to their favour
 15494	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith God, appearing in their wisdome, courage, or felicity. Hitherto
 15495	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore the Right of Regulating both the Policy, and the Religion,
 15496	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere inseparable.
 15497	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t

 15501	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf The Rights Of The Kings Of Israel
 15502	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15503	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo the Judges, succeeded Kings; And whereas before, all authority, both
 15504	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin Religion, and Policy, was in the High Priest; so now it was all in
 15505	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe King. For the Soveraignty over the people, which was before, not
 15506	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tonely by vertue of the Divine Power, but also by a particular pact of
 15507	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Israelites in God, and next under him, in the High Priest, as his
 15508	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tViceregent on earth, was cast off by the People, with the consent of God
 15509	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thimselfe. For when they said to Samuel (1 Sam. 8.5.) "make us a King to
 15510	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tjudge us, like all the Nations," they signified that they would no
 15511	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmore bee governed by the commands that should bee laid upon them by the
 15512	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPriest, in the name of God; but by one that should command them in the
 15513	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsame manner that all other nations were commanded; and consequently in
 15514	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdeposing the High Priest of Royall authority, they deposed that peculiar
 15515	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGovernment of God. And yet God consented to it, saying to Samuel (verse
 15516	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t7.) "Hearken unto the voice of the People, in all that they shall say
 15517	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunto thee; for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected mee,
 15518	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat I should not reign over them." Having therefore rejected God, in
 15519	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhose Right the Priests governed, there was no authority left to the
 15520	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPriests, but such as the King was pleased to allow them; which was
 15521	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmore, or lesse, according as the Kings were good, or evill. And for the
 15522	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGovernment of Civill affaires, it is manifest, it was all in the hands
 15523	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the King. For in the same Chapter, verse 20. They say they will be
 15524	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlike all the Nations; that their King shall be their Judge, and goe
 15525	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbefore them, and fight their battells; that is, he shall have the
 15526	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhole authority, both in Peace and War. In which is contained also the
 15527	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tordering of Religion; for there was no other Word of God in that time,
 15528	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby which to regulate Religion, but the Law of Moses, which was their
 15529	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCivill Law. Besides, we read (1 Kings 2.27.) that Solomon "thrust out
 15530	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAbiathar from being Priest before the Lord:" He had therefore authority
 15531	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tover the High Priest, as over any other Subject; which is a great
 15532	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmark of Supremacy in Religion. And we read also (1 Kings 8.) that hee
 15533	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdedicated the Temple; that he blessed the People; and that he himselfe
 15534	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin person made that excellent prayer, used in the Consecrations of all
 15535	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChurches, and houses of Prayer; which is another great mark of Supremacy
 15536	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin Religion. Again, we read (2 Kings 22.) that when there was question
 15537	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconcerning the Book of the Law found in the Temple, the same was not
 15538	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdecided by the High Priest, but Josiah sent both him, and others to
 15539	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tenquire concerning it, of Hulda, the Prophetesse; which is another mark
 15540	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Supremacy in Religion. Lastly, wee read (1 Chro. 26.30.) that
 15541	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDavid made Hashabiah and his brethren, Hebronites, Officers of Israel
 15542	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tamong them Westward, "in all businesse of the Lord, and in the service
 15543	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the King." Likewise (verse 32.) that hee made other Hebronites,
 15544	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"rulers over the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the halfe tribe of
 15545	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tManasseh" (these were the rest of Israel that dwelt beyond Jordan) "for
 15546	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevery matter pertaining to God, and affairs of the King." Is not this
 15547	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfull Power, both Temporall and Spirituall, as they call it, that would
 15548	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdivide it? To conclude; from the first institution of Gods Kingdome, to
 15549	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Captivity, the Supremacy of Religion, was in the same hand with that
 15550	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Civill Soveraignty; and the Priests office after the election of
 15551	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSaul, was not Magisteriall, but Ministeriall.

 15556	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Practice Of Supremacy In Religion, Was Not In The Time Of The Kings,
 15557	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15558	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAccording To The Right Thereof
 15559	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15560	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNotwithstanding the government both in Policy and Religion, were joined,
 15561	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfirst in the High Priests, and afterwards in the Kings, so far forth as
 15562	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconcerned the Right; yet it appeareth by the same Holy History, that the
 15563	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpeople understood it not; but there being amongst them a great part, and
 15564	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprobably the greatest part, that no longer than they saw great miracles,
 15565	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor (which is equivalent to a miracle) great abilities, or great felicity
 15566	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the enterprises of their Governours, gave sufficient credit, either
 15567	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto the fame of Moses, or to the Colloquies between God and the Priests;
 15568	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey took occasion as oft as their Governours displeased them, by
 15569	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tblaming sometimes the Policy, sometimes the Religion, to change the
 15570	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGovernment, or revolt from their Obedience at their pleasure: And from
 15571	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthence proceeded from time to time the civill troubles, divisions, and
 15572	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcalamities of the Nation. As for example, after the death of Eleazar and
 15573	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJoshua, the next generation which had not seen the wonders of God, but
 15574	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere left to their own weak reason, not knowing themselves obliged
 15575	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby the Covenant of a Sacerdotall Kingdome, regarded no more the
 15576	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommandement of the Priest, nor any law of Moses, but did every man that
 15577	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich was right in his own eyes; and obeyed in Civill affairs, such
 15578	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen, as from time to time they thought able to deliver them from the
 15579	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tneighbour Nations that oppressed them; and consulted not with God (as
 15580	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey ought to doe,) but with such men, or women, as they guessed to bee
 15581	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tProphets by their Praedictions of things to come; and thought they had
 15582	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tan Idol in their Chappel, yet if they had a Levite for their Chaplain,
 15583	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey made account they worshipped the God of Israel.
 15584	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15585	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd afterwards when they demanded a King, after the manner of the
 15586	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnations; yet it was not with a design to depart from the worship of God
 15587	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir King; but despairing of the justice of the sons of Samuel, they
 15588	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twould have a King to judg them in Civill actions; but not that they
 15589	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twould allow their King to change the Religion which they thought was
 15590	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trecommended to them by Moses. So that they alwaies kept in store a
 15591	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpretext, either of Justice, or Religion, to discharge themselves of
 15592	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir obedience, whensoever they had hope to prevaile. Samuel was
 15593	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdispleased with the people, for that they desired a King, (for God was
 15594	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir King already, and Samuel had but an authority under him); yet did
 15595	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSamuel, when Saul observed not his counsell, in destroying Agag as God
 15596	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thad commanded, anoint another King, namely David, to take the succession
 15597	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom his heirs. Rehoboam was no Idolater; but when the people thought
 15598	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim an Oppressor; that Civil pretence carried from him ten Tribes to
 15599	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJeroboam an Idolater. And generally through the whole History of the
 15600	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKings, as well of Judah, as of Israel, there were Prophets that alwaies
 15601	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontrolled the Kings, for transgressing the Religion; and sometimes also
 15602	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor Errours of State; (2 Chro. 19. 2.) as Jehosaphat was reproved by
 15603	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Prophet Jehu, for aiding the King of Israel against the Syrians;
 15604	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Hezekiah, by Isaiah, for shewing his treasures to the Ambassadors of
 15605	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBabylon. By all which it appeareth, that though the power both of State
 15606	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Religion were in the Kings; yet none of them were uncontrolled
 15607	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the use of it, but such as were gracious for their own naturall
 15608	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tabilities, or felicities. So that from the practise of those times,
 15609	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere can no argument be drawn, that the right of Supremacy in Religion
 15610	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas not in the Kings, unlesse we place it in the Prophets; and conclude,
 15611	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat because Hezekiah praying to the Lord before the Cherubins, was not
 15612	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tanswered from thence, nor then, but afterwards by the Prophet Isaiah,
 15613	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore Isaiah was supreme Head of the Church; or because Josiah
 15614	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsulted Hulda the Prophetesse, concerning the Book of the Law, that
 15615	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore neither he, nor the High Priest, but Hulda the Prophetesse had
 15616	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Supreme authority in matter of Religion; which I thinke is not the
 15617	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\topinion of any Doctor.

 15625	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15626	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd after their return, though they renewed their Covenant with God, yet
 15627	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere was no promise made of obedience, neither to Esdras, nor to any
 15628	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother; And presently after they became subjects to the Greeks (from
 15629	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhose Customes, and Daemonology, and from the doctrine of the Cabalists,
 15630	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir Religion became much corrupted): In such sort as nothing can be
 15631	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgathered from their confusion, both in State and Religion, concerning
 15632	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Supremacy in either. And therefore so far forth as concerneth the
 15633	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOld Testament, we may conclude, that whosoever had the Soveraignty
 15634	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Common-wealth amongst the Jews, the same had also the Supreme
 15635	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAuthority in matter of Gods externall worship; and represented Gods
 15636	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPerson; that is the person of God the Father; though he were not called
 15637	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby the name of Father, till such time as he sent into the world his Son
 15638	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJesus Christ, to redeem mankind from their sins, and bring them into his
 15639	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEverlasting Kingdome, to be saved for evermore. Of which we are to speak
 15640	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the Chapter following.

 15646	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15647	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15648	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15649	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThree Parts Of The Office Of Christ
 15650	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15651	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWe find in Holy Scripture three parts of the Office of the Messiah: the
 15652	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfirst of a Redeemer, or Saviour: The second of a Pastor, Counsellour,
 15653	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor Teacher, that is, of a Prophet sent from God, to convert such as God
 15654	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thath elected to Salvation; The third of a King, and Eternall King, but
 15655	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunder his Father, as Moses and the High Priests were in their severall
 15656	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttimes. And to these three parts are corespondent three times. For our
 15657	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRedemption he wrought at his first coming, by the Sacrifice, wherein
 15658	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the offered up himself for our sinnes upon the Crosse: our conversion
 15659	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the wrought partly then in his own Person; and partly worketh now by his
 15660	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMinisters; and will continue to work till his coming again. And after
 15661	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this coming again, shall begin that his glorious Reign over his elect,
 15662	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich is to last eternally.
 15663	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15664	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15665	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15666	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15667	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHis Office As A Redeemer
 15668	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15669	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo the Office of a Redeemer, that is, of one that payeth the Ransome of
 15670	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSin, (which Ransome is Death,) it appertaineth, that he was Sacrificed,
 15671	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand thereby bare upon his own head, and carryed away from us our
 15672	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tiniquities, in such sort as God had required. Not that the death of one
 15673	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman, though without sinne, can satisfie for the offences of all men,
 15674	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the rigour of Justice, but in the Mercy of God, that ordained such
 15675	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSacrifices for sin, as he was pleased in his mercy to accept. In the old
 15676	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaw (as we may read, Leviticus the 16.) the Lord required, that there
 15677	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshould every year once, bee made an Atonement for the Sins of all
 15678	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIsrael, both Priests, and others; for the doing whereof, Aaron alone was
 15679	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto sacrifice for himself and the Priests a young Bullock; and for the
 15680	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trest of the people, he was to receive from them two young Goates, of
 15681	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich he was to Sacrifice one; but as for the other, which was the Scape
 15682	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGoat, he was to lay his hands on the head thereof, and by a confession
 15683	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the iniquities of the people, to lay them all on that head, and then
 15684	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby some opportune man, to cause the Goat to be led into the wildernesse,
 15685	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand there to Escape, and carry away with him the iniquities of the
 15686	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpeople. As the Sacrifice of the one Goat was a sufficient (because an
 15687	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tacceptable) price for the Ransome of all Israel; so the death of the
 15688	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMessiah, is a sufficient price, for the Sins of all mankind, because
 15689	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere was no more required. Our Saviour Christs sufferings seem to be
 15690	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\there figured, as cleerly, as in the oblation of Isaac, or in any other
 15691	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttype of him in the Old Testament: He was both the sacrificed Goat, and
 15692	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Scape Goat; "Hee was oppressed, and he was afflicted (Isa. 53.7.);
 15693	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the opened not his mouth; he brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a
 15694	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsheep is dumbe before the shearer, so opened he not his mouth:" Here he
 15695	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis the Sacrificed Goat. "He hath born our Griefs, (ver.4.) and carried
 15696	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tour sorrows;" And again, (ver. 6.) "the Lord hath laid upon him the
 15697	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tiniquities of us all:" And so he is the Scape Goat. "He was cut off from
 15698	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe land of the living (ver. 8.) for the transgression of my People:"
 15699	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThere again he is the Sacrificed Goat. And again (ver. 11.) "he shall
 15700	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbear their sins:" Hee is the Scape Goat. Thus is the Lamb of God
 15701	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tequivalent to both those Goates; sacrificed, in that he dyed; and
 15702	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tescaping, in his Resurrection; being raised opportunely by his Father,
 15703	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand removed from the habitation of men in his Ascension.

 15706	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15707	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15708	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChrists Kingdome Not Of This World
 15709	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15710	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor as much therefore, as he that Redeemeth, hath no title to the Thing
 15711	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRedeemed, before the Redemption, and Ransome paid; and this Ransome was
 15712	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Death of the Redeemer; it is manifest, that our Saviour (as man) was
 15713	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot King of those that he Redeemed, before hee suffered death; that is,
 15714	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tduring that time hee conversed bodily on the Earth. I say, he was not
 15715	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthen King in present, by vertue of the Pact, which the faithfull make
 15716	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith him in Baptisme; Neverthelesse, by the renewing of their Pact with
 15717	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod in Baptisme, they were obliged to obey him for King, (under his
 15718	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFather) whensoever he should be pleased to take the Kingdome upon him.
 15719	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAccording whereunto, our Saviour himself expressely saith, (John 18.36.)
 15720	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"My Kingdome is not of this world." Now seeing the Scripture maketh
 15721	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmention but of two worlds; this that is now, and shall remain to the day
 15722	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Judgment, (which is therefore also called, The Last Day;) and that
 15723	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich shall bee a new Heaven, and a new Earth; the Kingdome of Christ
 15724	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis not to begin till the general Resurrection. And that is it which our
 15725	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSaviour saith, (Mat. 16.27.) "The Son of man shall come in the glory
 15726	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof his Father, with his Angels; and then he shall reward every man
 15727	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\taccording to his works." To reward every man according to his works, is
 15728	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto execute the Office of a King; and this is not to be till he come in
 15729	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe glory of his Father, with his Angells. When our Saviour saith,
 15730	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(Mat. 23.2.) "The Scribes and Pharisees sit in Moses seat; All therefore
 15731	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhatsoever they bid you doe, that observe and doe;" hee declareth
 15732	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tplainly, that hee ascribeth Kingly Power, for that time, not to
 15733	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thimselfe, but to them. And so hee hath also, where he saith, (Luke
 15734	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t12.14.) "Who made mee a Judge, or Divider over you?" And (John 12.47.)
 15735	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"I came not to judge the world, but to save the world." And yet our
 15736	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSaviour came into this world that hee might bee a King, and a Judge in
 15737	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe world to come: For hee was the Messiah, that is, the Christ, that
 15738	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis, the Anointed Priest, and the Soveraign Prophet of God; that is to
 15739	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsay, he was to have all the power that was in Moses the Prophet, in the
 15740	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHigh Priests that succeeded Moses, and in the Kings that succeeded the
 15741	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPriests. And St. John saies expressely (chap. 5. ver. 22.) "The Father
 15742	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tjudgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son." And this is
 15743	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot repugnant to that other place, "I came not to judge the world:" for
 15744	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis is spoken of the world present, the other of the world to come; as
 15745	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talso where it is said, that at the second coming of Christ, (Mat. 19.
 15746	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t28.) "Yee that have followed me in the Regeneration, when the Son of
 15747	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman shall sit in the throne of his Glory, yee shall also sit on twelve
 15748	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
 15749	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15750	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15751	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15752	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15753	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe End Of Christs Comming Was To Renew The Covenant Of The Kingdome
 15754	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15755	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf God, And To Perswade The Elect To Imbrace It, Which Was The Second
 15756	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15757	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPart Of His Office
 15758	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15759	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIf then Christ while hee was on Earth, had no Kingdome in this World,
 15760	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto what end was his first coming? It was to restore unto God, by a new
 15761	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCovenant, the Kingdome, which being his by the Old Covenant, had been
 15762	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcut off by the rebellion of the Israelites in the election of Saul.
 15763	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhich to doe, he was to preach unto them, that he was the Messiah, that
 15764	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis, the King promised to them by the Prophets; and to offer himselfe in
 15765	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsacrifice for the sinnes of them that should by faith submit themselves
 15766	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthereto; and in case the nation generally should refuse him, to call
 15767	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto his obedience such as should beleeve in him amongst the Gentiles. So
 15768	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat there are two parts of our Saviours Office during his aboad upon
 15769	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Earth; One to Proclaim himself the Christ; and another by Teaching,
 15770	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand by working of Miracles, to perswade, and prepare men to live so, as
 15771	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto be worthy of the Immortality Beleevers were to enjoy, at such time as
 15772	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the should come in majesty, to take possession of his Fathers Kingdome.
 15773	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd therefore it is, that the time of his preaching, is often by himself
 15774	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcalled the Regeneration; which is not properly a Kingdome, and thereby
 15775	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta warrant to deny obedience to the Magistrates that then were, (for
 15776	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thee commanded to obey those that sate then in Moses chaire, and to pay
 15777	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttribute to Caesar;) but onely an earnest of the Kingdome of God that was
 15778	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto come, to those to whom God had given the grace to be his disciples,
 15779	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand to beleeve in him; For which cause the Godly are said to bee already
 15780	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the Kingdome of Grace, as naturalized in that heavenly Kingdome.
 15781	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t

 15783	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15784	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15785	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Preaching Of Christ Not Contrary To The Then Law Of The Jews,
 15786	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15787	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNor Of Caesar
 15788	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15789	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHitherto therefore there is nothing done, or taught by Christ, that
 15790	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttendeth to the diminution of the Civill Right of the Jewes, or of
 15791	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCaesar. For as touching the Common-wealth which then was amongst
 15792	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Jews, both they that bare rule amongst them, that they that were
 15793	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgoverned, did all expect the Messiah, and Kingdome of God; which they
 15794	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcould not have done if their Laws had forbidden him (when he came) to
 15795	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmanifest, and declare himself. Seeing therefore he did nothing, but by
 15796	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPreaching, and Miracles go about to prove himselfe to be that Messiah,
 15797	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thee did therein nothing against their laws. The Kingdome hee claimed was
 15798	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto bee in another world; He taught all men to obey in the mean time them
 15799	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat sate in Moses seat: he allowed them to give Caesar his tribute, and
 15800	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trefused to take upon himselfe to be a Judg. How then could his words,
 15801	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor actions bee seditious, or tend to the overthrow of their then Civill
 15802	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGovernment? But God having determined his sacrifice, for the reduction
 15803	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof his elect to their former covenanted obedience, for the means,
 15804	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhereby he would bring the same to effect, made use of their malice,
 15805	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand ingratitude. Nor was it contrary to the laws of Caesar. For though
 15806	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPilate himself (to gratifie the Jews) delivered him to be crucified; yet
 15807	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbefore he did so, he pronounced openly, that he found no fault in him:
 15808	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd put for title of his condemnation, not as the Jews required, "that
 15809	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the pretended to be King;" but simply, "That hee was King of the Jews;"
 15810	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand notwithstanding their clamour, refused to alter it; saying, "What I
 15811	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave written, I have written."
 15812	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15813	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15814	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15815	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15816	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Third Part Of His Office Was To Be King (Under His Father)
 15817	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15818	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf The Elect
 15819	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15820	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAs for the third part of his Office, which was to be King, I have
 15821	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talready shewn that his Kingdome was not to begin till the Resurrection.
 15822	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut then he shall be King, not onely as God, in which sense he is
 15823	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKing already, and ever shall be, of all the Earth, in vertue of his
 15824	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tomnipotence; but also peculiarly of his own Elect, by vertue of the
 15825	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpact they make with him in their Baptisme. And therefore it is, that
 15826	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tour Saviour saith (Mat. 19.28.) that his Apostles should sit upon twelve
 15827	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel, "When the Son of man shall
 15828	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsit in the throne of his glory;" whereby he signified that he should
 15829	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treign then in his humane nature; and (Mat. 16.27.) "The Son of man shall
 15830	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcome in the glory of his Father, with his Angels, and then he shall
 15831	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treward every man according to his works." The same we may read, Marke
 15832	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t13..26. and 14.26. and more expressely for the time, Luke 22.29, 30. "I
 15833	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tappoint unto you a Kingdome, as my Father hath appointed to mee, that
 15834	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tyou may eat and drink at my table in my Kingdome, and sit on thrones
 15835	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tjudging the twelve tribes of Israel." By which it is manifest that the
 15836	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKingdome of Christ appointed to him by his Father, is not to be before
 15837	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Son of Man shall come in Glory, and make his Apostles Judges of
 15838	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe twelve tribes of Israel. But a man may here ask, seeing there is
 15839	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tno marriage in the Kingdome of Heaven, whether men shall then eat, and
 15840	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdrink; what eating therefore is meant in this place? This is expounded
 15841	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby our Saviour (John 6.27.) where he saith, "Labour not for the meat
 15842	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting
 15843	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlife, which the Son of man shall give you." So that by eating at Christs
 15844	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttable, is meant the eating of the Tree of Life; that is to say, the
 15845	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tenjoying of Immortality, in the Kingdome of the Son of Man. By which
 15846	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tplaces, and many more, it is evident, that our Saviours Kingdome is to
 15847	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbee exercised by him in his humane nature.
 15848	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15849	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15850	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15851	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15852	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChrists Authority In The Kingdome Of God Subordinate To His Father
 15853	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15854	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAgain, he is to be King then, no otherwise than as subordinate, or
 15855	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tViceregent of God the Father, as Moses was in the wildernesse; and as
 15856	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe High Priests were before the reign of Saul; and as the Kings were
 15857	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tafter it. For it is one of the Prophecies concerning Christ, that he
 15858	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshould be like (in Office) to Moses; "I will raise them up a Prophet
 15859	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(saith the Lord, Deut. 18.18.) from amongst their Brethren like unto
 15860	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthee, and will put my words into his mouth," and this similitude with
 15861	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMoses, is also apparent in the actions of our Saviour himself, whilest
 15862	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the was conversant on Earth. For as Moses chose twelve Princes of the
 15863	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttribes, to govern under him; so did our Saviour choose twelve Apostles,
 15864	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twho shall sit on twelve thrones, and judge the twelve tribes of Israel;
 15865	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd as Moses authorized Seventy Elders, to receive the Spirit of God,
 15866	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand to Prophecy to the people, that is, (as I have said before,) to
 15867	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tspeak unto them in the name of God; so our Saviour also ordained seventy
 15868	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDisciples, to preach his Kingdome, and Salvation to all Nations. And as
 15869	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhen a complaint was made to Moses, against those of the Seventy that
 15870	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprophecyed in the camp of Israel, he justified them in it, as being
 15871	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsubservient therein to his government; so also our Saviour, when St.
 15872	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJohn complained to him of a certain man that cast out Devills in his
 15873	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tname, justified him therein, saying, (Luke 9.50.) "Forbid him not, for
 15874	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thee that is not against us, is on our part."
 15875	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15876	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAgain, our Saviour resembled Moses in the institution of Sacraments,
 15877	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tboth of Admission into the Kingdome of God, and of Commemoration of his
 15878	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdeliverance of his Elect from their miserable condition. As the Children
 15879	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Israel had for Sacrament of their Reception into the Kingdome of God,
 15880	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbefore the time of Moses, the rite of Circumcision, which rite having
 15881	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeen omitted in the Wildernesse, was again restored as soon as they came
 15882	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinto the land of Promise; so also the Jews, before the coming of our
 15883	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSaviour, had a rite of Baptizing, that is, of washing with water all
 15884	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose that being Gentiles, embraced the God of Israel. This rite St.
 15885	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJohn the Baptist used in the reception of all them that gave their names
 15886	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto the Christ, whom hee preached to bee already come into the world; and
 15887	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tour Saviour instituted the same for a Sacrament to be taken by all that
 15888	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeleeved in him. From what cause the rite of Baptisme first proceeded,
 15889	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis not expressed formally in the Scripture; but it may be probably
 15890	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthought to be an imitation of the law of Moses, concerning Leprousie;
 15891	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twherein the Leprous man was commanded to be kept out of the campe of
 15892	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIsrael for a certain time; after which time being judged by the Priest
 15893	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto be clean, hee was admitted into the campe after a solemne Washing.
 15894	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd this may therefore bee a type of the Washing in Baptisme; wherein
 15895	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch men as are cleansed of the Leprousie of Sin by Faith, are received
 15896	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinto the Church with the solemnity of Baptisme. There is another
 15897	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconjecture drawn from the Ceremonies of the Gentiles, in a certain case
 15898	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat rarely happens; and that is, when a man that was thought dead,
 15899	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tchanced to recover, other men made scruple to converse with him, as they
 15900	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twould doe to converse with a Ghost, unlesse hee were received again into
 15901	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe number of men, by Washing, as Children new born were washed from
 15902	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe uncleannesse of their nativity, which was a kind of new birth. This
 15903	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tceremony of the Greeks, in the time that Judaea was under the Dominion
 15904	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Alexander, and the Greeks his successors, may probably enough have
 15905	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcrept into the Religion of the Jews. But seeing it is not likely our
 15906	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSaviour would countenance a Heathen rite, it is most likely it proceeded
 15907	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom the Legall Ceremony of Washing after Leprosie. And for the other
 15908	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSacraments, of eating the Paschall Lambe, it is manifestly imitated in
 15909	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Sacrament of the Lords Supper; in which the Breaking of the Bread,
 15910	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand the pouring out of the Wine, do keep in memory our deliverance from
 15911	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Misery of Sin, by Christs Passion, as the eating of the Paschall
 15912	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLambe, kept in memory the deliverance of the Jewes out of the Bondage of
 15913	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEgypt. Seeing therefore the authority of Moses was but subordinate, and
 15914	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thee but a Lieutenant to God; it followeth, that Christ, whose authority,
 15915	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas man, was to bee like that of Moses, was no more but subordinate to
 15916	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe authority of his Father. The same is more expressely signified, by
 15917	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat that hee teacheth us to pray, "Our Father, Let thy Kingdome come;"
 15918	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand, "For thine is the Kingdome, the power and the Glory;" and by that
 15919	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit is said, that "Hee shall come in the Glory of his Father;" and by
 15920	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat which St. Paul saith, (1 Cor. 15.24.) "then commeth the end, when
 15921	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thee shall have delivered up the Kingdome to God, even the Father;" and
 15922	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby many other most expresse places.

 15926	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15927	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOne And The Same God Is The Person Represented By Moses, And By Christ
 15928	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15929	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOur Saviour therefore, both in Teaching, and Reigning, representeth (as
 15930	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMoses Did) the Person of God; which God from that time forward, but
 15931	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot before, is called the Father; and being still one and the same
 15932	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsubstance, is one Person as represented by Moses, and another Person as
 15933	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trepresented by his Sonne the Christ. For Person being a relative to a
 15934	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRepresenter, it is consequent to plurality of Representers, that there
 15935	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbee a plurality of Persons, though of one and the same Substance.

 15941	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15942	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor the understanding of POWER ECCLESIASTICALL, what, and in whom it is,
 15943	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twe are to distinguish the time from the Ascension of our Saviour, into
 15944	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttwo parts; one before the Conversion of Kings, and men endued with
 15945	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign Civill Power; the other after their Conversion. For it was
 15946	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlong after the Ascension, before any King, or Civill Soveraign embraced,
 15947	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand publiquely allowed the teaching of Christian Religion.
 15948	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15949	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15950	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15951	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15952	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf The Holy Spirit That Fel On The Apostles
 15953	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15954	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd for the time between, it is manifest, that the Power
 15955	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEcclesiasticall, was in the Apostles; and after them in such as were by
 15956	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem ordained to Preach the Gospell, and to convert men to Christianity,
 15957	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand to direct them that were converted in the way of Salvation; and
 15958	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tafter these the Power was delivered again to others by these ordained,
 15959	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand this was done by Imposition of hands upon such as were ordained; by
 15960	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich was signified the giving of the Holy Spirit, or Spirit of God, to
 15961	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose whom they ordained Ministers of God, to advance his Kingdome.
 15962	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSo that Imposition of hands, was nothing else but the Seal of their
 15963	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommission to Preach Christ, and teach his Doctrine; and the giving of
 15964	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Holy Ghost by that ceremony of Imposition of hands, was an imitation
 15965	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof that which Moses did. For Moses used the same ceremony to his
 15966	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMinister Joshua, as wee read Deuteronomy 34. ver. 9. "And Joshua the son
 15967	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Nun was full of the Spirit of Wisdome; for Moses had laid his
 15968	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thands upon him." Our Saviour therefore between his Resurrection, and
 15969	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAscension, gave his Spirit to the Apostles; first, by "Breathing on
 15970	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem, and saying," (John 20.22.) "Receive yee the Holy Spirit;" and after
 15971	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this Ascension (Acts 2.2, 3.) by sending down upon them, a "mighty wind,
 15972	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Cloven tongues of fire;" and not by Imposition of hands; as neither
 15973	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdid God lay his hands on Moses; and his Apostles afterward, transmitted
 15974	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe same Spirit by Imposition of hands, as Moses did to Joshua. So that
 15975	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit is manifest hereby, in whom the Power Ecclesiasticall continually
 15976	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tremained, in those first times, where there was not any Christian
 15977	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth; namely, in them that received the same from the Apostles,
 15978	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby successive laying on of hands.
 15979	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15980	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15981	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15982	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15983	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf The Trinity
 15984	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 15985	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHere wee have the Person of God born now the third time. For as Moses,
 15986	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand the High Priests, were Gods Representative in the Old Testament;
 15987	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand our Saviour himselfe as Man, during his abode on earth: So the Holy
 15988	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGhost, that is to say, the Apostles, and their successors, in the Office
 15989	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Preaching, and Teaching, that had received the Holy Spirit, have
 15990	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRepresented him ever since. But a Person, (as I have shewn before,
 15991	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t[chapt. 16.].) is he that is Represented, as often as hee is
 15992	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRepresented; and therefore God, who has been Represented (that is,
 15993	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPersonated) thrice, may properly enough be said to be three Persons;
 15994	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthough neither the word Person, nor Trinity be ascribed to him in the
 15995	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBible. St. John indeed (1 Epist. 5.7.) saith, "There be three that bear
 15996	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twitnesse in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these
 15997	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThree are One:" But this disagreeth not, but accordeth fitly with three
 15998	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPersons in the proper signification of Persons; which is, that which is
 15999	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRepresented by another. For so God the Father, as Represented by Moses,
 16000	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis one Person; and as Represented by his Sonne, another Person, and as
 16001	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRepresented by the Apostles, and by the Doctors that taught by authority
 16002	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom them derived, is a third Person; and yet every Person here, is
 16003	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Person of one and the same God. But a man may here ask, what it was
 16004	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhereof these three bare witnesse. St. John therefore tells us (verse
 16005	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t11.) that they bear witnesse, that "God hath given us eternall life
 16006	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin his Son." Again, if it should be asked, wherein that testimony
 16007	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tappeareth, the Answer is easie; for he hath testified the same by the
 16008	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmiracles he wrought, first by Moses; secondly, by his Son himself; and
 16009	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlastly by his Apostles, that had received the Holy Spirit; all which
 16010	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin their times Represented the Person of God; and either prophecyed, or
 16011	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpreached Jesus Christ. And as for the Apostles, it was the character
 16012	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Apostleship, in the twelve first and great Apostles, to bear
 16013	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWitnesse of his Resurrection; as appeareth expressely (Acts 1. ver.
 16014	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t21,22.) where St Peter, when a new Apostle was to be chosen in the place
 16015	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Judas Iscariot, useth these words, "Of these men which have companied
 16016	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out amongst us,
 16017	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeginning at the Baptisme of John, unto that same day that hee was
 16018	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttaken up from us, must one bee ordained to be a Witnesse with us of his
 16019	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tResurrection:" which words interpret the Bearing of Witnesse, mentioned
 16020	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby St. John. There is in the same place mentioned another Trinity of
 16021	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWitnesses in Earth. For (ver. 8.) he saith, "there are three that bear
 16022	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWitnesse in Earth, the Spirit, and the Water, and the Bloud; and these
 16023	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthree agree in one:" that is to say, the graces of Gods Spirit, and the
 16024	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttwo Sacraments, Baptisme, and the Lords Supper, which all agree in one
 16025	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTestimony, to assure the consciences of beleevers, of eternall life; of
 16026	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich Testimony he saith (verse 10.) "He that beleeveth on the Son of
 16027	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman hath the Witnesse in himselfe." In this Trinity on Earth the Unity
 16028	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis not of the thing; for the Spirit, the Water, and the Bloud, are not
 16029	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe same substance, though they give the same testimony: But in the
 16030	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTrinity of Heaven, the Persons are the persons of one and the same God,
 16031	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthough Represented in three different times and occasions. To conclude,
 16032	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe doctrine of the Trinity, as far as can be gathered directly from
 16033	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Scripture, is in substance this; that God who is alwaies One and the
 16034	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsame, was the Person Represented by Moses; the Person Represented by
 16035	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this Son Incarnate; and the Person Represented by the Apostles. As
 16036	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRepresented by the Apostles, the Holy Spirit by which they spake, is
 16037	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod; As Represented by his Son (that was God and Man), the Son is that
 16038	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod; As represented by Moses, and the High Priests, the Father, that is
 16039	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto say, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, is that God: From whence
 16040	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twe may gather the reason why those names Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in
 16041	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe signification of the Godhead, are never used in the Old Testament:
 16042	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor they are Persons, that is, they have their names from Representing;
 16043	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich could not be, till divers men had Represented Gods Person in
 16044	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\truling, or in directing under him.
 16045	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16046	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThus wee see how the Power Ecclesiasticall was left by our Saviour
 16047	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto the Apostles; and how they were (to the end they might the better
 16048	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texercise that Power,) endued with the Holy Spirit, which is therefore
 16049	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcalled sometime in the New Testament Paracletus which signifieth an
 16050	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAssister, or one called to for helpe, though it bee commonly translated
 16051	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Comforter. Let us now consider the Power it selfe, what it was, and
 16052	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tover whom.
 16053	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16054	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16055	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16056	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16057	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Power Ecclesiasticall Is But The Power To Teach
 16058	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16059	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCardinall Bellarmine in his third generall Controversie, hath handled a
 16060	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgreat many questions concerning the Ecclesiasticall Power of the Pope
 16061	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Rome; and begins with this, Whether it ought to be Monarchicall,
 16062	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAristocraticall, or Democraticall. All which sorts of Power, are
 16063	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign, and Coercive. If now it should appear, that there is no
 16064	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCoercive Power left them by our Saviour; but onely a Power to proclaim
 16065	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Kingdom of Christ, and to perswade men to submit themselves
 16066	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthereunto; and by precepts and good counsell, to teach them that have
 16067	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsubmitted, what they are to do, that they may be received into the
 16068	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKingdom of God when it comes; and that the Apostles, and other Ministers
 16069	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Gospel, are our Schoolemasters, and not our Commanders, and their
 16070	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPrecepts not Laws, but wholesome Counsells then were all that dispute in

 16077	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16078	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tI have shewn already (in the last Chapter,) that the Kingdome of Christ
 16079	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis not of this world: therefore neither can his Ministers (unlesse they
 16080	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe Kings,) require obedience in his name. For if the Supreme King, have
 16081	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot his Regall Power in this world; by what authority can obedience be
 16082	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trequired to his Officers? As my Father sent me, (so saith our Saviour)
 16083	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tI send you. But our Saviour was sent to perswade the Jews to return to,
 16084	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand to invite the Gentiles, to receive the Kingdome of his Father, and
 16085	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot to reign in Majesty, no not, as his Fathers Lieutenant, till the day

 16093	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe time between the Ascension, and the generall Resurrection, is
 16094	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcalled, not a Reigning, but a Regeneration; that is, a Preparation
 16095	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof men for the second and glorious coming of Christ, at the day of
 16096	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJudgment; as appeareth by the words of our Saviour, Mat. 19.28. "You
 16097	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat have followed me in the Regeneration, when the Son of man shall sit
 16098	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the throne of his glory, you shall also sit upon twelve Thrones;" And
 16099	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof St. Paul (Ephes. 6.15.) "Having your feet shod with the Preparation

 16105	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFrom The Comparison Of It, With Fishing, Leaven, Seed
 16106	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16107	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd is compared by our Saviour, to Fishing; that is, to winning men
 16108	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto obedience, not by Coercion, and Punishing; but by Perswasion: and
 16109	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore he said not to his Apostles, hee would make them so many
 16110	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNimrods, Hunters Of Men; But Fishers Of Men. It is compared also to
 16111	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLeaven; to Sowing of Seed, and to the Multiplication of a grain of
 16112	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMustard-seed; by all which Compulsion is excluded; and consequently
 16113	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere can in that time be no actual Reigning. The work of Christs
 16114	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMinisters, is Evangelization; that is, a Proclamation of Christ, and
 16115	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta preparation for his second comming; as the Evangelization of John
 16116	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBaptist, was a preparation to his first coming.

 16119	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16120	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16121	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFrom The Nature Of Faith:
 16122	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16123	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAgain, the Office of Christs Ministers in this world, is to make men
 16124	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBeleeve, and have Faith in Christ: But Faith hath no relation to, nor
 16125	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdependence at all upon Compulsion, or Commandement; but onely upon
 16126	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcertainty, or probability of Arguments drawn from Reason, or from
 16127	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsomething men beleeve already. Therefore the Ministers of Christ in this
 16128	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tworld, have no Power by that title, to Punish any man for not Beleeving,
 16129	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor for Contradicting what they say; they have I say no Power by that
 16130	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttitle of Christs Ministers, to Punish such: but if they have Soveraign
 16131	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCivill Power, by politick institution, then they may indeed lawfully
 16132	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPunish any Contradiction to their laws whatsoever: And St. Paul, of
 16133	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thimselfe and other then Preachers of the Gospell saith in expresse
 16134	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twords, (2 Cor. 1.24.) "Wee have no Dominion over your Faith, but are
 16135	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHelpers of your Joy."

 16139	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16140	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFrom The Authority Christ Hath Left To Civill Princes
 16141	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16142	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnother Argument, that the Ministers of Christ in this present world
 16143	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave no right of Commanding, may be drawn from the lawfull Authority
 16144	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich Christ hath left to all Princes, as well Christians, as Infidels.
 16145	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSt. Paul saith (Col. 3.20.) "Children obey your Parents in all things;
 16146	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor this is well pleasing to the Lord." And ver. 22. "Servants obey in
 16147	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall things your Masters according to the flesh, not with eye-service, as
 16148	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen-pleasers, but in singlenesse of heart, as fearing the Lord;" This is
 16149	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tspoken to them whose Masters were Infidells; and yet they are bidden
 16150	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto obey them In All Things. And again, concerning obedience to Princes.
 16151	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(Rom. 13. the first 6. verses) exhorting to "be subject to the Higher
 16152	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPowers," he saith, "that all Power is ordained of God;" and "that we
 16153	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tought to be subject to them, not onely for" fear of incurring their
 16154	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"wrath, but also for conscience sake." And St. Peter, (1 Epist. chap. 2e
 16155	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tver. 13, 14, 15.) "Submit your selves to every Ordinance of Man, for the
 16156	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLords sake, whether it bee to the King, as Supreme, or unto Governours,
 16157	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas to them that be sent by him for the punishment of evill doers, and
 16158	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor the praise of them that doe well; for so is the will of God."
 16159	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd again St. Paul (Tit. 3.1.) "Put men in mind to be subject to
 16160	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPrincipalities, and Powers, and to obey Magistrates." These Princes, and
 16161	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPowers, whereof St. Peter, and St. Paul here speak, were all Infidels;
 16162	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmuch more therefore we are to obey those Christians, whom God hath
 16163	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tordained to have Soveraign Power over us. How then can wee be obliged
 16164	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto doe any thing contrary to the Command of the King, or other Soveraign
 16165	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRepresentant of the Common-wealth, whereof we are members, and by whom
 16166	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twe look to be protected? It is therefore manifest, that Christ hath not
 16167	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tleft to his Ministers in this world, unlesse they be also endued with
 16168	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCivill Authority, any authority to Command other men.
 16169	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t

 16171	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16172	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16173	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhat Christians May Do To Avoid Persecution
 16174	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16175	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut what (may some object) if a King, or a Senate, or other Soveraign
 16176	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPerson forbid us to beleeve in Christ? To this I answer, that such
 16177	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tforbidding is of no effect, because Beleef, and Unbeleef never follow
 16178	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmens Commands. Faith is a gift of God, which Man can neither give, nor
 16179	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttake away by promise of rewards, or menaces of torture. And if it be
 16180	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfurther asked, What if wee bee commanded by our lawfull Prince, to say
 16181	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith our tongue, wee beleeve not; must we obey such command? Profession
 16182	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith the tongue is but an externall thing, and no more then any other
 16183	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgesture whereby we signifie our obedience; and wherein a Christian,
 16184	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tholding firmely in his heart the Faith of Christ, hath the same liberty
 16185	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich the Prophet Elisha allowed to Naaman the Syrian. Naaman was
 16186	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconverted in his heart to the God of Israel; For hee saith (2 Kings
 16187	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t5.17.) "Thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering, nor
 16188	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsacrifice unto other Gods but unto the Lord. In this thing the Lord
 16189	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpardon thy servant, that when my Master goeth into the house of Rimmon
 16190	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow my selfe in the
 16191	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thouse of Rimmon; when I bow my selfe in the house of Rimmon, the Lord
 16192	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpardon thy servant in this thing." This the Prophet approved, and bid
 16193	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim "Goe in peace." Here Naaman beleeved in his heart; but by bowing
 16194	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbefore the Idol Rimmon, he denyed the true God in effect, as much as
 16195	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tif he had done it with his lips. But then what shall we answer to our
 16196	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSaviours saying, "Whosoever denyeth me before men, I will deny him
 16197	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbefore my Father which is in Heaven?" This we may say, that whatsoever
 16198	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Subject, as Naaman was, is compelled to in obedience to his Soveraign,
 16199	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand doth it not in order to his own mind, but in order to the laws of
 16200	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this country, that action is not his, but his Soveraigns; nor is it he
 16201	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat in this case denyeth Christ before men, but his Governour, and the
 16202	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlaw of his countrey. If any man shall accuse this doctrine, as repugnant
 16203	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto true, and unfeigned Christianity; I ask him, in case there should be
 16204	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta subject in any Christian Common-wealth, that should be inwardly in his
 16205	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\theart of the Mahometan Religion, whether if his Soveraign Command him to
 16206	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbee present at the divine service of the Christian Church, and that on
 16207	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpain of death, he think that Mamometan obliged in conscience to suffer
 16208	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdeath for that cause, rather than to obey that command of his lawful
 16209	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPrince. If he say, he ought rather to suffer death, then he authorizeth
 16210	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall private men, to disobey their Princes, in maintenance of their
 16211	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tReligion, true, or false; if he say, he ought to bee obedient, then he
 16212	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talloweth to himself, that which hee denyeth to another, contrary to the
 16213	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twords of our Saviour, "Whatsoever you would that men should doe unto
 16214	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tyou, that doe yee unto them;" and contrary to the Law of Nature, (which
 16215	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis the indubitable everlasting Law of God) "Do not to another, that
 16216	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich thou wouldest not he should doe unto thee."

 16220	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16221	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf Martyrs
 16222	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16223	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut what then shall we say of all those Martyrs we read of in the
 16224	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHistory of the Church, that they have needlessely cast away their lives?
 16225	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor answer hereunto, we are to distinguish the persons that have been
 16226	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor that cause put to death; whereof some have received a Calling to
 16227	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpreach, and professe the Kingdome of Christ openly; others have had no
 16228	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch Calling, nor more has been required of them than their owne faith.
 16229	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe former sort, if they have been put to death, for bearing witnesse to
 16230	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis point, that Jesus Christ is risen from the dead, were true Martyrs;
 16231	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor a Martyr is, (to give the true definition of the word) a Witnesse of
 16232	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Resurrection of Jesus the Messiah; which none can be but those
 16233	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat conversed with him on earth, and saw him after he was risen: For a
 16234	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWitnesse must have seen what he testifieth, or else his testimony is not
 16235	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgood. And that none but such, can properly be called Martyrs of Christ,
 16236	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis manifest out of the words of St. Peter, Act. 1.21, 22. "Wherefore of
 16237	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthese men which have companyed with us all the time that the Lord Jesus
 16238	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twent in and out amongst us, beginning from the Baptisme of John unto
 16239	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat same day hee was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a
 16240	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMartyr (that is a Witnesse) with us of his Resurrection:" Where we
 16241	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmay observe, that he which is to bee a Witnesse of the truth of
 16242	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Resurrection of Christ, that is to say, of the truth of this
 16243	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfundamentall article of Christian Religion, that Jesus was the Christ,
 16244	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmust be some Disciple that conversed with him, and saw him before, and
 16245	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tafter his Resurrection; and consequently must be one of his originall
 16246	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDisciples: whereas they which were not so, can Witnesse no more, but
 16247	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat their antecessors said it, and are therefore but Witnesses of
 16248	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother mens testimony; and are but second Martyrs, or Martyrs of Christs
 16249	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWitnesses.
 16250	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16251	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHe, that to maintain every doctrine which he himself draweth out of
 16252	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe History of our Saviours life, and of the Acts, or Epistles of the
 16253	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tApostles; or which he beleeveth upon the authority of a private man,
 16254	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twil oppose the Laws and Authority of the Civill State, is very far from
 16255	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeing a Martyr of Christ, or a Martyr of his Martyrs. 'Tis one Article
 16256	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tonely, which to die for, meriteth so honorable a name; and that Article
 16257	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis this, that Jesus Is The Christ; that is to say, He that hath redeemed
 16258	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tus, and shall come again to give us salvation, and eternall life in his
 16259	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tglorious Kingdome. To die for every tenet that serveth the ambition,
 16260	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor profit of the Clergy, is not required; nor is it the Death of the
 16261	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWitnesse, but the Testimony it self that makes the Martyr: for the word
 16262	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsignifieth nothing else, but the man that beareth Witnesse, whether he
 16263	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe put to death for his testimony, or not.
 16264	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16265	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAlso he that is not sent to preach this fundamentall article, but taketh
 16266	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit upon him of his private authority, though he be a Witnesse, and
 16267	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsequently a Martyr, either primary of Christ, or secondary of his
 16268	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tApostles, Disciples, or their Successors; yet is he not obliged to
 16269	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuffer death for that cause; because being not called thereto, tis
 16270	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot required at his hands; nor ought hee to complain, if he loseth
 16271	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe reward he expecteth from those that never set him on work. None
 16272	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore can be a Martyr, neither of the first, nor second degree, that
 16273	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave not a warrant to preach Christ come in the flesh; that is to say,
 16274	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnone, but such as are sent to the conversion of Infidels. For no man
 16275	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis a Witnesse to him that already beleeveth, and therefore needs no
 16276	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWitnesse; but to them that deny, or doubt, or have not heard it. Christ
 16277	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsent his Apostles, and his Seventy Disciples, with authority to preach;
 16278	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the sent not all that beleeved: And he sent them to unbeleevers; "I send
 16279	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tyou (saith he) as sheep amongst wolves;" not as sheep to other sheep.

 16284	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tArgument From The Points Of Their Commission
 16285	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16286	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLastly the points of their Commission, as they are expressely set down
 16287	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the Gospel, contain none of them any authority over the Congregation.
 16288	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16289	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16290	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16291	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16292	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo Preach
 16293	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16294	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWe have first (Mat. 10.) that the twelve Apostles were sent "to the
 16295	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlost sheep of the house of Israel," and commanded to Preach, "that the
 16296	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKingdome of God was at hand." Now Preaching in the originall, is that
 16297	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tact, which a Crier, Herald, or other Officer useth to doe publiquely in
 16298	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tProclaiming of a King. But a Crier hath not right to Command any man.
 16299	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd (Luke 10.2.) the seventy Disciples are sent out, "as Labourers,
 16300	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot as Lords of the Harvest;" and are bidden (verse 9.) to say, "The
 16301	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKingdome of God is come nigh unto you;" and by Kingdome here is meant,
 16302	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot the Kingdome of Grace, but the Kingdome of Glory; for they are
 16303	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbidden to denounce it (ver. 11.) to those Cities which shall not receive
 16304	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem, as a threatning, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for
 16305	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSodome, than for such a City. And (Mat. 20.28.) our Saviour telleth his
 16306	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDisciples, that sought Priority of place, their Office was to minister,
 16307	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teven as the Son of man came, not to be ministred unto, but to minister.
 16308	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPreachers therefore have not Magisteriall, but Ministeriall power: "Bee
 16309	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot called Masters, (saith our Saviour, Mat. 23.10) for one is your
 16310	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMaster, even Christ."
 16311	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16312	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16313	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16314	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16315	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd Teach
 16316	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16317	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnother point of their Commission, is, to Teach All Nations; as it is in
 16318	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMat. 28.19. or as in St. Mark 16.15 "Goe into all the world, and Preach
 16319	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Gospel to every creature." Teaching therefore, and Preaching is the
 16320	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsame thing. For they that Proclaim the comming of a King, must withall
 16321	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmake known by what right he commeth, if they mean men shall submit
 16322	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthemselves unto him: As St. Paul did to the Jews of Thessalonica,
 16323	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhen "three Sabbath days he reasoned with them out of the Scriptures,
 16324	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\topening, and alledging that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen
 16325	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagain from the dead, and that this Jesus is Christ." But to teach out
 16326	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Old Testament that Jesus was Christ, (that is to say, King,)
 16327	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand risen from the dead, is not to say, that men are bound after they
 16328	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeleeve it, to obey those that tell them so, against the laws, and
 16329	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommands of their Soveraigns; but that they shall doe wisely, to expect
 16330	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe coming of Christ hereafter, in Patience, and Faith, with Obedience
 16331	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto their present Magistrates.
 16332	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16333	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16334	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16335	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16336	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo Baptize;
 16337	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16338	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnother point of their Commission, is to Baptize, "in the name of
 16339	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost." What is Baptisme?
 16340	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDipping into water. But what is it to Dip a man into the water in the
 16341	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tname of any thing? The meaning of these words of Baptisme is this. He
 16342	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat is Baptized, is Dipped or Washed, as a sign of becomming a new man,
 16343	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand a loyall subject to that God, whose Person was represented in old
 16344	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttime by Moses, and the High Priests, when he reigned over the Jews; and
 16345	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto Jesus Christ, his Sonne, God, and Man, that hath redeemed us, and
 16346	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshall in his humane nature Represent his Fathers Person in his eternall
 16347	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKingdome after the Resurrection; and to acknowledge the Doctrine of the
 16348	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tApostles, who assisted by the Spirit of the Father, and of the Son, were
 16349	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tleft for guides to bring us into that Kingdome, to be the onely, and
 16350	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tassured way thereunto. This, being our promise in Baptisme; and the
 16351	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAuthority of Earthly Soveraigns being not to be put down till the day of
 16352	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJudgment; (for that is expressely affirmed by S. Paul 1 Cor. 15. 22, 23,
 16353	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t24. where he saith, "As in Adam all die, so in Christ all shall be
 16354	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmade alive. But every man in his owne order, Christ the first fruits,
 16355	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tafterward they that are Christs, at his comming; Then Commeth the end,
 16356	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhen he shall have delivered up the Kingdome of God, even the Father,
 16357	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhen he shall have put down all Rule, and all Authority and Power")
 16358	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit is manifest, that we do not in Baptisme constitute over us another
 16359	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tauthority, by which our externall actions are to be governed in this
 16360	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlife; but promise to take the doctrine of the Apostles for our direction
 16361	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the way to life eternall.
 16362	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t

 16364	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16365	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16366	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd To Forgive, And Retain Sinnes
 16367	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16368	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Power of Remission, And Retention Of Sinnes, called also the Power
 16369	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Loosing, and Binding, and sometimes the Keyes Of The Kingdome Of
 16370	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHeaven, is a consequence of the Authority to Baptize, or refuse to
 16371	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBaptize. For Baptisme is the Sacrament of Allegeance, of them that are
 16372	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto be received into the Kingdome of God; that is to say, into Eternall
 16373	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlife; that is to say, to Remission of Sin: For as Eternall life was lost
 16374	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby the Committing, so it is recovered by the Remitting of mens Sins. The
 16375	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tend of Baptisme is Remission of Sins: and therefore St. Peter, when they
 16376	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat were converted by his Sermon on the day of Pentecost, asked what
 16377	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey were to doe, advised them to "repent, and be Baptized in the name
 16378	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Jesus, for the Remission of Sins." And therefore seeing to Baptize
 16379	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis to declare the Reception of men into Gods Kingdome; and to refuse to
 16380	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBaptize is to declare their Exclusion; it followeth, that the Power
 16381	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto declare them Cast out, or Retained in it, was given to the same
 16382	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tApostles, and their Substitutes, and Successors. And therefore after our
 16383	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSaviour had breathed upon them, saying, (John 20.22.) "Receive the Holy
 16384	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGhost," hee addeth in the next verse, "Whose soever Sins ye Remit,
 16385	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey are Remitted unto them; and whose soever Sins ye Retain, they are
 16386	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRetained." By which words, is not granted an Authority to Forgive, or
 16387	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRetain Sins, simply and absolutely, as God Forgiveth or Retaineth them,
 16388	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twho knoweth the Heart of man, and truth of his Penitence and Conversion;
 16389	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut conditionally, to the Penitent: And this Forgivenesse, or
 16390	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAbsolution, in case the absolved have but a feigned Repentance, is
 16391	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthereby without other act, or sentence of the Absolvent, made void,
 16392	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand hath no effect at all to Salvation, but on the contrary, to the
 16393	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAggravation of his Sin. Therefore the Apostles, and their Successors,
 16394	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare to follow but the outward marks of Repentance; which appearing, they
 16395	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave no Authority to deny Absolution; and if they appeare not, they have
 16396	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tno authority to Absolve. The same also is to be observed in Baptisme:
 16397	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor to a converted Jew, or Gentile, the Apostles had not the Power to
 16398	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdeny Baptisme; nor to grant it to the Un-penitent. But seeing no man is
 16399	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\table to discern the truth of another mans Repentance, further than by
 16400	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texternall marks, taken from his words, and actions, which are subject to
 16401	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thypocrisie; another question will arise, Who it is that is constituted
 16402	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJudge of those marks. And this question is decided by our Saviour
 16403	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thimself; (Mat. 18. 15, 16, 17.) "If thy Brother (saith he) shall
 16404	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttrespasse against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee, and him
 16405	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talone; if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy Brother. But if he
 16406	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twill not hear thee, then take with thee one, or two more. And if he
 16407	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the Church, let him be unto
 16408	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthee as an Heathen man, and a Publican." By which it is manifest, that
 16409	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Judgment concerning the truth of Repentance, belonged not to any one
 16410	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMan, but to the Church, that is, to the Assembly of the Faithfull, or
 16411	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto them that have authority to bee their Representant. But besides the
 16412	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJudgment, there is necessary also the pronouncing of Sentence: And
 16413	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis belonged alwaies to the Apostle, or some Pastor of the Church,
 16414	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas Prolocutor; and of this our Saviour speaketh in the 18 verse,
 16415	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven; and
 16416	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhatsoever ye shall loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven." And
 16417	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcomformable hereunto was the practise of St. Paul (1 Cor. 5.3, 4, & 5.)
 16418	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhere he saith, "For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit,
 16419	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave determined already, as though I were present, concerning him that
 16420	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thath so done this deed; In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ when ye
 16421	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus
 16422	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChrist, To deliver such a one to Satan;" that is to say, to cast him
 16423	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tout of the Church, as a man whose Sins are not Forgiven. Paul here
 16424	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpronounceth the Sentence; but the Assembly was first to hear the Cause,
 16425	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(for St. Paul was absent;) and by consequence to condemn him. But in
 16426	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe same chapter (ver. 11, 12.) the Judgment in such a case is more
 16427	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texpressely attributed to the Assembly: "But now I have written unto
 16428	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tyou, not to keep company, if any man that is called a Brother be a
 16429	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFornicator, &c. with such a one no not to eat. For what have I to do to
 16430	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tjudg them that are without? Do not ye judg them that are within?"
 16431	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Sentence therefore by which a man was put out of the Church, was
 16432	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpronounced by the Apostle, or Pastor; but the Judgment concerning the
 16433	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmerit of the cause, was in the Church; that is to say, (as the times
 16434	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere before the conversion of Kings, and men that had Soveraign
 16435	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAuthority in the Common-wealth,) the Assembly of the Christians dwelling
 16436	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the same City; as in Corinth, in the Assembly of the Christians of
 16437	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCorinth.

 16442	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf Excommunication
 16443	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16444	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThis part of the Power of the Keyes, by which men were thrust out from
 16445	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Kingdome of God, is that which is called Excommunication; and to
 16446	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texcommunicate, is in the Originall, Aposunagogon Poiein, To Cast Out Of
 16447	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Synagogue; that is, out of the place of Divine service; a word drawn
 16448	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom the custom of the Jews, to cast out of their Synagogues, such as
 16449	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey thought in manners, or doctrine, contagious, as Lepers were by the
 16450	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaw of Moses separated from the congregation of Israel, till such time
 16451	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas they should be by the Priest pronounced clean.

 16456	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Use Of Excommunication Without Civill Power.
 16457	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16458	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Use and Effect of Excommunication, whilest it was not yet
 16459	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tstrengthened with the Civill Power, was no more, than that they, who
 16460	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere not Excommunicate, were to avoid the company of them that were.
 16461	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIt was not enough to repute them as Heathen, that never had been
 16462	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChristians; for with such they might eate, and drink; which with
 16463	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tExcommunicate persons they might not do; as appeareth by the words of
 16464	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSt. Paul, (1 Cor. 5. ver. 9, 10, &c.) where he telleth them, he had
 16465	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tformerly forbidden them to "company with Fornicators;" but (because that
 16466	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcould not bee without going out of the world,) he restraineth it to such
 16467	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFornicators, and otherwise vicious persons, as were of the brethren;
 16468	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"with such a one" (he saith) they ought not to keep company, "no, not to
 16469	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teat." And this is no more than our Saviour saith (Mat. 18.17.) "Let
 16470	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim be to thee as a Heathen, and as a Publican." For Publicans (which
 16471	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsignifieth Farmers, and Receivers of the revenue of the Common-wealth)
 16472	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere so hated, and detested by the Jews that were to pay for it, as
 16473	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat Publican and Sinner were taken amongst them for the same thing:
 16474	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInsomuch, as when our Saviour accepted the invitation of Zacchaeus a
 16475	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPublican; though it were to Convert him, yet it was objected to him as
 16476	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Crime. And therefore, when our Saviour, to Heathen, added Publican, he
 16477	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdid forbid them to eat with a man Excommunicate.
 16478	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16479	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAs for keeping them out of their Synagogues, or places of Assembly, they
 16480	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thad no Power to do it, but that of the owner of the place, whether he
 16481	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere Christian, or Heathen. And because all places are by right, in the
 16482	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDominion of the Common-wealth; as well hee that was Excommunicated, as
 16483	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thee that never was Baptized, might enter into them by Commission from
 16484	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Civill Magistrate; as Paul before his conversion entred into their
 16485	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSynagogues at Damascus, (Acts 9.2.) to apprehend Christians, men and
 16486	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twomen, and to carry them bound to Jerusalem, by Commission from the High
 16487	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPriest.

 16490	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16491	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16492	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf No Effect Upon An Apostate
 16493	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16494	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBy which it appears, that upon a Christian, that should become an
 16495	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tApostate, in a place where the Civill Power did persecute, or not assist
 16496	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Church, the effect of Excommunication had nothing in it, neither of
 16497	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdammage in this world, nor of terrour: Not of terrour, because of their
 16498	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunbeleef; nor of dammage, because they returned thereby into the favour
 16499	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the world; and in the world to come, were to be in no worse estate,
 16500	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthen they which never had beleeved. The dammage redounded rather to the
 16501	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChurch, by provocation of them they cast out, to a freer execution of
 16502	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir malice.
 16503	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16504	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16505	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16506	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16507	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut Upon The Faithfull Only
 16508	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16509	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tExcommunication therefore had its effect onely upon those, that beleeved
 16510	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat Jesus Christ was to come again in Glory, to reign over, and to
 16511	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tjudge both the quick, and the dead, and should therefore refuse entrance
 16512	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinto his Kingdom, to those whose Sins were Retained; that is, to those
 16513	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat were Excommunicated by the Church. And thence it is that St. Paul
 16514	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcalleth Excommunication, a delivery of the Excommunicate person to
 16515	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSatan. For without the Kingdom of Christ, all other Kingdomes after
 16516	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJudgment, are comprehended in the Kingdome of Satan. This is it that the
 16517	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfaithfull stood in fear of, as long as they stood Excommunicate, that is
 16518	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto say, in an estate wherein their sins were not Forgiven. Whereby wee
 16519	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmay understand, that Excommunication in the time that Christian Religion
 16520	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas not authorized by the Civill Power, was used onely for a correction
 16521	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof manners, not of errours in opinion: for it is a punishment, whereof
 16522	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnone could be sensible but such as beleeved, and expected the coming
 16523	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagain of our Saviour to judge the world; and they who so beleeved,
 16524	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tneeded no other opinion, but onely uprightnesse of life, to be saved.
 16525	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16526	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16527	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16528	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16529	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor What Fault Lyeth Excommunication
 16530	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16531	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThere Lyeth Excommunication for Injustice; as (Mat. 18.) If thy Brother
 16532	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\toffend thee, tell it him privately; then with Witnesses; lastly, tell
 16533	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Church; and then if he obey not, "Let him be to thee as an Heathen
 16534	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman, and a Publican." And there lyeth Excommunication for a Scandalous
 16535	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLife, as (1 Cor. 5. 11.) "If any man that is called a Brother, be
 16536	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Fornicator, or Covetous, or an Idolater, or a Drunkard, or an
 16537	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tExtortioner, with such a one yee are not to eat." But to Excommunicate a
 16538	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman that held this foundation, that Jesus Was The Christ, for difference
 16539	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof opinion in other points, by which that Foundation was not destroyed,
 16540	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere appeareth no authority in the Scripture, nor example in the
 16541	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tApostles. There is indeed in St. Paul (Titus 3.10.) a text that seemeth
 16542	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto be to the contrary. "A man that is an Haeretique, after the first
 16543	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand second admonition, reject." For an Haeretique, is he, that being a
 16544	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmember of the Church, teacheth neverthelesse some private opinion, which
 16545	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Church has forbidden: and such a one, S. Paul adviseth Titus, after
 16546	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe first, and second admonition, to Reject. But to Reject (in this
 16547	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tplace) is not to Excommunicate the Man; But to Give Over Admonishing
 16548	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHim, To Let Him Alone, To Set By Disputing With Him, as one that is to
 16549	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe convinced onely by himselfe. The same Apostle saith (2 Tim. 2.23.)
 16550	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"Foolish and unlearned questions avoid;" The word Avoid in this place,
 16551	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Reject in the former, is the same in the Originall, paraitou: but
 16552	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFoolish questions may bee set by without Excommunication. And again,
 16553	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(Tit. 3.93) "Avoid Foolish questions," where the Originall, periistaso,
 16554	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(set them by) is equivalent to the former word Reject. There is no
 16555	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother place that can so much as colourably be drawn, to countenance
 16556	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Casting out of the Church faithfull men, such as beleeved the
 16557	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfoundation, onely for a singular superstructure of their own, proceeding
 16558	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tperhaps from a good & pious conscience. But on the contrary, all such
 16559	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tplaces as command avoiding such disputes, are written for a Lesson to
 16560	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPastors, (such as Timothy and Titus were) not to make new Articles of
 16561	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFaith, by determining every small controversie, which oblige men to a
 16562	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tneedlesse burthen of Conscience, or provoke them to break the union of
 16563	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Church. Which Lesson the Apostles themselves observed well. S. Peter
 16564	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand S. Paul, though their controversie were great, (as we may read
 16565	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin Gal. 2.11.) yet they did not cast one another out of the Church.
 16566	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNeverthelesse, during the Apostles time, there were other Pastors that
 16567	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobserved it not; As Diotrephes (3 John 9. &c.) who cast out of the
 16568	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChurch, such as S. John himself thought fit to be received into it, out
 16569	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof a pride he took in Praeeminence; so early it was, that Vainglory, and
 16570	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAmbition had found entrance into the Church of Christ.
 16571	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16572	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16573	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16574	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16575	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf Persons Liable To Excommunication
 16576	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16577	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThat a man be liable to Excommunication, there be many conditions
 16578	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trequisite; as First, that he be a member of some Commonalty, that is to
 16579	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsay, of some lawfull Assembly, that is to say, of some Christian
 16580	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChurch, that hath power to judge of the cause for which hee is to
 16581	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbee Excommunicated. For where there is no community, there can bee no
 16582	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tExcommunication; nor where there is no power to Judge, can there bee any
 16583	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpower to give Sentence. From hence it followeth, that one Church cannot
 16584	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe Excommunicated by another: For either they have equall power
 16585	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto Excommunicate each other, in which case Excommunication is not
 16586	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDiscipline, nor an act of Authority, but Schisme, and Dissolution of
 16587	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcharity; or one is so subordinate to the other, as that they both
 16588	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave but one voice, and then they be but one Church; and the part
 16589	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tExcommunicated, is no more a Church, but a dissolute number of
 16590	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tindividuall persons.
 16591	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16592	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd because the sentence of Excommunication, importeth an advice, not to
 16593	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tkeep company, nor so much as to eat with him that is Excommunicate, if
 16594	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Soveraign Prince, or Assembly bee Excommunicate, the sentence is of no
 16595	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teffect. For all Subjects are bound to be in the company and presence of
 16596	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir own Soveraign (when he requireth it) by the law of Nature; nor
 16597	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcan they lawfully either expell him from any place of his own Dominion,
 16598	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhether profane or holy; nor go out of his Dominion, without his leave;
 16599	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmuch lesse (if he call them to that honour,) refuse to eat with him. And
 16600	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas to other Princes and States, because they are not parts of one and
 16601	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe same congregation, they need not any other sentence to keep
 16602	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem from keeping company with the State Excommunicate: for the
 16603	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tvery Institution, as it uniteth many men into one Community; so it
 16604	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdissociateth one Community from another: so that Excommunication is
 16605	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot needfull for keeping Kings and States asunder; nor has any further
 16606	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teffect then is in the nature of Policy it selfe; unlesse it be to
 16607	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinstigate Princes to warre upon one another.
 16608	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16609	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNor is the Excommunication of a Christian Subject, that obeyeth the laws
 16610	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof his own Soveraign, whether Christian, or Heathen, of any effect. For
 16611	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tif he beleeve that "Jesus is the Christ, he hath the Spirit of God" (1

 16613	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thee that hath the Spirit of God; hee that dwelleth in God; hee in
 16614	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhom God dwelleth, can receive no harm by the Excommunication of men.
 16615	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTherefore, he that beleeveth Jesus to be the Christ, is free from all
 16616	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe dangers threatned to persons Excommunicate. He that beleeveth it
 16617	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot, is no Christian. Therefore a true and unfeigned Christian is not
 16618	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tliable to Excommunication; Nor he also that is a professed Christian,
 16619	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttill his Hypocrisy appear in his Manners, that is, till his behaviour
 16620	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbee contrary to the law of his Soveraign, which is the rule of Manners,
 16621	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand which Christ and his Apostles have commanded us to be subject to.
 16622	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor the Church cannot judge of Manners but by externall Actions, which
 16623	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tActions can never bee unlawfull, but when they are against the Law of
 16624	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Common-wealth.
 16625	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16626	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIf a mans Father, or Mother, or Master bee Excommunicate, yet are not
 16627	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Children forbidden to keep them Company, nor to Eat with them; for
 16628	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat were (for the most part) to oblige them not to eat at all, for want
 16629	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof means to get food; and to authorise them to disobey their Parents,
 16630	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Masters, contrary to the Precept of the Apostles.
 16631	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16632	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn summe, the Power of Excommunication cannot be extended further than
 16633	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto the end for which the Apostles and Pastors of the Church have
 16634	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir Commission from our Saviour; which is not to rule by Command and
 16635	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCoaction, but by Teaching and Direction of men in the way of Salvation
 16636	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the world to come. And as a Master in any Science, may abandon his
 16637	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tScholar, when hee obstinately neglecteth the practise of his rules; but
 16638	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot accuse him of Injustice, because he was never bound to obey him:
 16639	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tso a Teacher of Christian doctrine may abandon his Disciples that
 16640	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobstinately continue in an unchristian life; but he cannot say, they doe
 16641	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim wrong, because they are not obliged to obey him: For to a Teacher
 16642	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat shall so complain, may be applyed the Answer of God to Samuel in
 16643	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe like place, (1 Sam. 8.) "They have not rejected thee, but mee."
 16644	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tExcommunication therefore when it wanteth the assistance of the Civill
 16645	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPower, as it doth, when a Christian State, or Prince is Excommunicate
 16646	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby a forain Authority, is without effect; and consequently ought to
 16647	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe without terrour. The name of Fulmen Excommunicationis (that is, the
 16648	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThunderbolt Of Excommunication) proceeded from an imagination of the
 16649	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBishop of Rome, which first used it, that he was King of Kings, as the
 16650	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHeathen made Jupiter King of the Gods; and assigned him in their Poems,
 16651	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Pictures, a Thunderbolt, wherewith to subdue, and punish the Giants,
 16652	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat should dare to deny his power: Which imagination was grounded on
 16653	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttwo errours; one, that the Kingdome of Christ is of this world, contrary
 16654	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto our Saviours owne words, "My Kingdome is not of this world;" the
 16655	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother, that hee is Christs Vicar, not onely over his owne Subjects,
 16656	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut over all the Christians of the World; whereof there is no ground in
 16657	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tScripture, and the contrary shall bee proved in its due place.

 16665	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16666	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSt. Paul coming to Thessalonica, where was a Synagogue of the Jews,
 16667	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(Acts 17.2, 3.) "As his manner was, went in unto them, and three Sabbath
 16668	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdayes reasoned with them out of the Scriptures, Opening and alledging,
 16669	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat Christ must needs have suffered and risen again from the dead; and
 16670	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat this Jesus whom he preached was the Christ." The Scriptures here
 16671	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmentioned were the Scriptures of the Jews, that is, the Old Testament.
 16672	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe men, to whom he was to prove that Jesus was the Christ, and risen
 16673	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagain from the dead, were also Jews, and did beleeve already, that
 16674	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey were the Word of God. Hereupon (as it is verse 4.) some of them
 16675	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeleeved, and (as it is in the 5. ver.) some beleeved not. What was
 16676	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe reason, when they all beleeved the Scripture, that they did not
 16677	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall beleeve alike; but that some approved, others disapproved the
 16678	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInterpretation of St. Paul that cited them; and every one Interpreted
 16679	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem to himself? It was this; S. Paul came to them without any Legall
 16680	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommission, and in the manner of one that would not Command, but
 16681	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPerswade; which he must needs do, either by Miracles, as Moses did
 16682	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto the Israelites in Egypt, that they might see his Authority in Gods
 16683	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tworks; or by Reasoning from the already received Scripture, that
 16684	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey might see the truth of his doctrine in Gods Word. But whosoever
 16685	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tperswadeth by reasoning from principles written, maketh him to whom hee
 16686	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tspeaketh Judge, both of the meaning of those principles, and also of the
 16687	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tforce of his inferences upon them. If these Jews of Thessalonica were
 16688	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot, who else was the Judge of what S. Paul alledged out of Scripture?
 16689	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIf S. Paul, what needed he to quote any places to prove his doctrine? It
 16690	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thad been enough to have said, I find it so in Scripture, that is to
 16691	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsay, in your Laws, of which I am Interpreter, as sent by Christ. The
 16692	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInterpreter therefore of the Scripture, to whose Interpretation the
 16693	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJews of Thessalonica were bound to stand, could be none: every one might
 16694	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeleeve, or not beleeve, according as the Allegations seemed to himselfe
 16695	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto be agreeable, or not agreeable to the meaning of the places alledged.
 16696	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd generally in all cases of the world, hee that pretendeth any proofe,
 16697	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmaketh Judge of his proofe him to whom he addresseth his speech. And as
 16698	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto the case of the Jews in particular, they were bound by expresse words
 16699	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(Deut. 17.) to receive the determination of all hard questions, from
 16700	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Priests and Judges of Israel for the time being. But this is to bee
 16701	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunderstood of the Jews that were yet unconverted.
 16702	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16703	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor the Conversion of the Gentiles, there was no use of alledging the
 16704	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tScriptures, which they beleeved not. The Apostles therefore laboured by
 16705	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tReason to confute their Idolatry; and that done, to perswade them to the
 16706	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfaith of Christ, by their testimony of his Life, and Resurrection. So
 16707	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat there could not yet bee any controversie concerning the authority
 16708	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto Interpret Scripture; seeing no man was obliged during his infidelity,
 16709	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto follow any mans Interpretation of any Scripture, except his
 16710	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraigns Interpretation of the Laws of his countrey.
 16711	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16712	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLet us now consider the Conversion it self, and see what there was
 16713	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherein, that could be cause of such an obligation. Men were converted
 16714	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto no other thing then to the Beleef of that which the Apostles
 16715	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpreached: And the Apostles preached nothing, but that Jesus was the
 16716	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChrist, that is to say, the King that was to save them, and reign over
 16717	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem eternally in the world to come; and consequently that hee was not
 16718	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdead, but risen again from the dead, and gone up into Heaven, and should
 16719	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcome again one day to judg the world, (which also should rise again to
 16720	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe judged,) and reward every man according to his works. None of them
 16721	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpreached that himselfe, or any other Apostle was such an Interpreter
 16722	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Scripture, as all that became Christians, ought to take their
 16723	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInterpretation for Law. For to Interpret the Laws, is part of the
 16724	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAdministration of a present Kingdome; which the Apostles had not. They
 16725	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprayed then, and all other Pastors ever since, "Let thy Kingdome come;"
 16726	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand exhorted their Converts to obey their then Ethnique Princes. The New
 16727	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTestament was not yet published in one Body. Every of the Evangelists
 16728	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas Interpreter of his own Gospel; and every Apostle of his own Epistle;
 16729	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd of the Old Testament, our Saviour himselfe saith to the Jews (John
 16730	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t5. 39.) "Search the Scriptures; for in them yee thinke to have eternall
 16731	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlife, and they are they that testifie of me." If hee had not meant they
 16732	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshould Interpret them, hee would not have bidden them take thence the
 16733	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tproof of his being the Christ; he would either have Interpreted them
 16734	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thimselfe, or referred them to the Interpretation of the Priests.
 16735	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16736	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhen a difficulty arose, the Apostles and Elders of the Church assembled
 16737	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthemselves together, and determined what should bee preached, and
 16738	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttaught, and how they should Interpret the Scriptures to the People;
 16739	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut took not from the People the liberty to read, and Interpret them to
 16740	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthemselves. The Apostles sent divers Letters to the Churches, and other
 16741	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWritings for their instruction; which had been in vain, if they had not
 16742	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tallowed them to Interpret, that is, to consider the meaning of them.
 16743	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd as it was in the Apostles time, it must be till such time as
 16744	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere should be Pastors, that could authorise an Interpreter, whose
 16745	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInterpretation should generally be stood to: But that could not be till
 16746	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKings were Pastors, or Pastors Kings.

 16751	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf The Power To Make Scripture Law
 16752	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16753	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThere be two senses, wherein a Writing may be said to be Canonicall;
 16754	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor Canon, signifieth a Rule; and a Rule is a Precept, by which a man
 16755	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis guided, and directed in any action whatsoever. Such Precepts, though
 16756	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgiven by a Teacher to his Disciple, or a Counsellor to his friend,
 16757	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twithout power to Compell him to observe them, are neverthelesse Canons;
 16758	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbecause they are Rules: But when they are given by one, whom he that
 16759	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treceiveth them is bound to obey, then are those Canons, not onely Rules,
 16760	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut Laws: The question therefore here, is of the Power to make the
 16761	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tScriptures (which are the Rules of Christian Faith) Laws.
 16762	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16763	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16764	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16765	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16766	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf The Ten Commandements
 16767	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16768	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThat part of the Scripture, which was first Law, was the Ten
 16769	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommandements, written in two Tables of Stone, and delivered by God
 16770	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thimselfe to Moses; and by Moses made known to the people. Before that
 16771	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttime there was no written Law of God, who as yet having not chosen any
 16772	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpeople to bee his peculiar Kingdome, had given no Law to men, but the
 16773	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaw of Nature, that is to say, the Precepts of Naturall Reason, written
 16774	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin every mans own heart. Of these two Tables, the first containeth the
 16775	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlaw of Soveraignty; 1. That they should not obey, nor honour the Gods of
 16776	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother Nations, in these words, "Non habebis Deos alienos coram me," that
 16777	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis, "Thou shalt not have for Gods, the Gods that other Nations worship;
 16778	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut onely me:" whereby they were forbidden to obey, or honor, as their
 16779	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKing and Governour, any other God, than him that spake unto them then by
 16780	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMoses, and afterwards by the High Priest. 2. That they "should not make
 16781	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tany Image to represent him;" that is to say, they were not to choose to
 16782	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthemselves, neither in heaven, nor in earth, any Representative of their
 16783	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\town fancying, but obey Moses and Aaron, whom he had appointed to that
 16784	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\toffice. 3. That "they should not take the Name of God in vain;" that is,
 16785	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey should not speak rashly of their King, nor dispute his Right,
 16786	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnor the commissions of Moses and Aaron, his Lieutenants. 4. That "they
 16787	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshould every Seventh day abstain from their ordinary labour," and employ
 16788	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat time in doing him Publique Honor. The second Table containeth the
 16789	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDuty of one man towards another, as "To honor Parents; Not to kill;
 16790	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNot to Commit Adultery; Not to steale; Not to corrupt Judgment by false
 16791	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twitnesse;" and finally, "Not so much as to designe in their heart the
 16792	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdoing of any injury one to another." The question now is, Who it was
 16793	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat gave to these written Tables the obligatory force of Lawes. There
 16794	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis no doubt but that they were made Laws by God himselfe: But because a
 16795	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaw obliges not, nor is Law to any, but to them that acknowledge it to
 16796	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe the act of the Soveraign, how could the people of Israel that were
 16797	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tforbidden to approach the Mountain to hear what God said to Moses, be
 16798	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobliged to obedience to all those laws which Moses propounded to them?
 16799	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSome of them were indeed the Laws of Nature, as all the Second Table;
 16800	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand therefore to be acknowledged for Gods Laws; not to the Israelites
 16801	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talone, but to all people: But of those that were peculiar to the
 16802	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIsraelites, as those of the first Table, the question remains; saving
 16803	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat they had obliged themselves, presently after the propounding of
 16804	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem, to obey Moses, in these words (Exod. 20.19.) "Speak them thou to
 16805	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tus, and we will hear thee; but let not God speak to us, lest we die." It
 16806	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas therefore onely Moses then, and after him the High Priest, whom (by
 16807	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMoses) God declared should administer this his peculiar Kingdome, that
 16808	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thad on Earth, the power to make this short Scripture of the Decalogue
 16809	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto bee Law in the Common-wealth of Israel. But Moses, and Aaron, and the
 16810	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsucceeding High Priests were the Civill Soveraigns. Therefore hitherto,
 16811	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Canonizing, or making of the Scripture Law, belonged to the Civill
 16812	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraigne.

 16820	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMagistrates of Israel, for the rule of their administration of Justice,
 16821	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand of the Sentences, or Judgments they should pronounce, in Pleas
 16822	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbetween man and man; and the Leviticall Law, that is to say, the rule
 16823	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat God prescribed touching the Rites and Ceremonies of the Priests and
 16824	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLevites, were all delivered to them by Moses onely; and therefore also
 16825	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbecame Lawes, by vertue of the same promise of obedience to Moses.
 16826	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhether these laws were then written, or not written, but dictated to
 16827	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe People by Moses (after his forty dayes being with God in the Mount)
 16828	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby word of mouth, is not expressed in the Text; but they were all
 16829	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpositive Laws, and equivalent to holy Scripture, and made Canonicall by

 16835	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Second Law
 16836	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16837	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAfter the Israelites were come into the Plains of Moab over against
 16838	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJericho, and ready to enter into the land of Promise, Moses to the
 16839	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tformer Laws added divers others; which therefore are called Deuteronomy:
 16840	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat is, Second Laws. And are (as it is written, Deut. 29.1.) "The words
 16841	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof a Covenant which the Lord commanded Moses to make with the Children
 16842	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Israel, besides the Covenant which he made with them in Horeb." For
 16843	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thaving explained those former Laws, in the beginning of the Book of
 16844	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDeuteronomy, he addeth others, that begin at the 12. Cha. and continue
 16845	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto the end of the 26. of the same Book. This Law (Deut. 27.1.) they were
 16846	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommanded to write upon great stones playstered over, at their passing
 16847	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tover Jordan: This Law also was written by Moses himself in a Book; and
 16848	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdelivered into the hands of the "Priests, and to the Elders of Israel,"
 16849	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(Deut. 31.9.) and commanded (ve. 26.) "to be put in the side of the
 16850	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tArke;" for in the Ark it selfe was nothing but the Ten Commandements.
 16851	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThis was the Law, which Moses (Deuteronomy 17.18.) commanded the Kings
 16852	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Israel should keep a copie of: And this is the Law, which having been
 16853	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlong time lost, was found again in the Temple in the time of Josiah,
 16854	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand by his authority received for the Law of God. But both Moses at the
 16855	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twriting, and Josiah at the recovery thereof, had both of them the
 16856	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCivill Soveraignty. Hitherto therefore the Power of making Scripture
 16857	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCanonicall, was in the Civill Soveraign.
 16858	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16859	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBesides this Book of the Law, there was no other Book, from the time of
 16860	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMoses, till after the Captivity, received amongst the Jews for the
 16861	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaw of God. For the Prophets (except a few) lived in the time of the
 16862	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCaptivity it selfe; and the rest lived but a little before it; and were
 16863	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tso far from having their Prophecies generally received for Laws, as that
 16864	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir persons were persecuted, partly by false Prophets, and partly by
 16865	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Kings which were seduced by them. And this Book it self, which was
 16866	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconfirmed by Josiah for the Law of God, and with it all the History of
 16867	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Works of God, was lost in the Captivity, and sack of the City of
 16868	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJerusalem, as appears by that of 2 Esdras 14.21. "Thy Law is burnt;
 16869	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefor no man knoweth the things that are done of thee, of the works
 16870	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat shall begin." And before the Captivity, between the time when the
 16871	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaw was lost, (which is not mentioned in the Scripture, but may probably
 16872	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe thought to be the time of Rehoboam, when Shishak King of Egypt took
 16873	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe spoils of the Temple,(1 Kings 14.26.)) and the time of Josiah,
 16874	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhen it was found againe, they had no written Word of God, but ruled
 16875	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\taccording to their own discretion, or by the direction of such, as each
 16876	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof them esteemed Prophets.
 16877	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16878	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16879	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16880	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16881	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Old Testament, When Made Canonicall
 16882	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16883	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFrom whence we may inferre, that the Scriptures of the Old Testament,
 16884	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich we have at this day, were not Canonicall, nor a Law unto the Jews,
 16885	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttill the renovation of their Covenant with God at their return from the
 16886	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCaptivity, and restauration of their Common-wealth under Esdras. But
 16887	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom that time forward they were accounted the Law of the Jews, and for
 16888	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch translated into Greek by Seventy Elders of Judaea, and put into the
 16889	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLibrary of Ptolemy at Alexandria, and approved for the Word of God. Now
 16890	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tseeing Esdras was the High Priest, and the High Priest was their Civill
 16891	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraigne, it is manifest, that the Scriptures were never made Laws,
 16892	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut by the Soveraign Civill Power.
 16893	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16894	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe New Testament Began To Be Canonicall Under Christian Soveraigns By
 16895	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Writings of the Fathers that lived in the time before that Christian
 16896	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tReligion was received, and authorised by Constantine the Emperour, we
 16897	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmay find, that the Books wee now have of the New Testament, were held by
 16898	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Christians of that time (except a few, in respect of whose paucity
 16899	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe rest were called the Catholique Church, and others Haeretiques) for
 16900	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe dictates of the Holy Ghost; and consequently for the Canon, or Rule
 16901	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Faith: such was the reverence and opinion they had of their Teachers;
 16902	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas generally the reverence that the Disciples bear to their first
 16903	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMasters, in all manner of doctrine they receive from them, is not small.
 16904	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTherefore there is no doubt, but when S. Paul wrote to the Churches he
 16905	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thad converted; or any other Apostle, or Disciple of Christ, to those
 16906	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich had then embraced Christ, they received those their Writings for
 16907	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe true Christian Doctrine. But in that time, when not the Power and
 16908	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAuthority of the Teacher, but the Faith of the Hearer caused them
 16909	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto receive it, it was not the Apostles that made their own Writings
 16910	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCanonicall, but every Convert made them so to himself.
 16911	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16912	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut the question here, is not what any Christian made a Law, or Canon
 16913	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto himself, (which he might again reject, by the same right he received
 16914	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit;) but what was so made a Canon to them, as without injustice they
 16915	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcould not doe any thing contrary thereunto. That the New Testament
 16916	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshould in this sense be Canonicall, that is to say, a Law in any place
 16917	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhere the Law of the Common-wealth had not made it so, is contrary to
 16918	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe nature of a Law. For a Law, (as hath been already shewn) is the
 16919	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommandement of that Man, or Assembly, to whom we have given Soveraign
 16920	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAuthority, to make such Rules for the direction of our actions, as hee
 16921	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshall think fit; and to punish us, when we doe any thing contrary to the
 16922	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsame. When therefore any other man shall offer unto us any other Rules,
 16923	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich the Soveraign Ruler hath not prescribed, they are but Counsell,
 16924	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Advice; which, whether good, or bad, hee that is counselled, may
 16925	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twithout injustice refuse to observe, and when contrary to the Laws
 16926	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talready established, without injustice cannot observe, how good soever
 16927	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the conceiveth it to be. I say, he cannot in this case observe the same
 16928	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin his actions, nor in his discourse with other men; though he may
 16929	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twithout blame beleeve the his private Teachers, and wish he had the
 16930	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tliberty to practise their advice; and that it were publiquely received
 16931	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor Law. For internall faith is in its own nature invisible, and
 16932	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsequently exempted from all humane jurisdiction; whereas the words,
 16933	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand actions that proceed from it, as breaches of our Civil obedience,
 16934	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare injustice both before God and Man. Seeing then our Saviour hath
 16935	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdenyed his Kingdome to be in this world, seeing he hath said, he came
 16936	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot to judge, but to save the world, he hath not subjected us to other
 16937	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaws than those of the Common-wealth; that is, the Jews to the Law
 16938	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Moses, (which he saith (Mat. 5.) he came not to destroy, but to
 16939	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfulfill,) and other Nations to the Laws of their severall Soveraigns,
 16940	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand all men to the Laws of Nature; the observing whereof, both he
 16941	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thimselfe, and his Apostles have in their teaching recommended to us, as
 16942	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta necessary condition of being admitted by him in the last day into his
 16943	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teternall Kingdome, wherein shall be Protection, and Life everlasting.
 16944	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSeeing then our Saviour, and his Apostles, left not new Laws to oblige
 16945	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tus in this world, but new Doctrine to prepare us for the next; the Books
 16946	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the New Testament, which containe that Doctrine, untill obedience to
 16947	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem was commanded, by them that God hath given power to on earth to be
 16948	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLegislators, were not obligatory Canons, that is, Laws, but onely good,
 16949	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand safe advice, for the direction of sinners in the way to salvation,
 16950	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich every man might take, and refuse at his owne perill, without
 16951	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinjustice.
 16952	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16953	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAgain, our Saviour Christs Commission to his Apostles, and Disciples,
 16954	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas to Proclaim his Kingdome (not present, but) to come; and to Teach
 16955	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall Nations; and to Baptize them that should beleeve; and to enter into
 16956	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe houses of them that should receive them; and where they were not
 16957	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treceived, to shake off the dust of their feet against them; but not
 16958	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto call for fire from heaven to destroy them, nor to compell them to
 16959	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobedience by the Sword. In all which there is nothing of Power, but of
 16960	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPerswasion. He sent them out as Sheep unto Wolves, not as Kings to their
 16961	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSubjects. They had not in Commission to make Laws; but to obey, and
 16962	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tteach obedience to Laws made; and consequently they could not make their
 16963	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWritings obligatory Canons, without the help of the Soveraign Civill
 16964	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPower. And therefore the Scripture of the New Testament is there only
 16965	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaw, where the lawfull Civill Power hath made it so. And there also the
 16966	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKing, or Soveraign, maketh it a Law to himself; by which he subjecteth
 16967	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thimselfe, not to the Doctor, or Apostle, that converted him, but to God
 16968	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thimself, and his Son Jesus Christ, as immediately as did the Apostles
 16969	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthemselves.
 16970	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16971	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16972	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16973	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16974	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf The Power Of Councells To Make The Scripture Law
 16975	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 16976	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThat which may seem to give the New Testament, in respect of those that
 16977	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave embraced Christian Doctrine, the force of Laws, in the times, and
 16978	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tplaces of persecution, is the decrees they made amongst themselves in
 16979	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir Synods. For we read (Acts 15.28.) the stile of the Councell of the
 16980	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tApostles, the Elders, and the whole Church, in this manner, "It seemed
 16981	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgood to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burthen
 16982	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthan these necessary things, &C." which is a stile that signifieth a
 16983	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPower to lay a burthen on them that had received their Doctrine. Now
 16984	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"to lay a burthen on another," seemeth the same that "to oblige;" and
 16985	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore the Acts of that Councell were Laws to the then Christians.
 16986	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNeverthelesse, they were no more Laws than are these other Precepts,
 16987	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"Repent, Be Baptized; Keep the Commandements; Beleeve the Gospel; Come
 16988	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunto me; Sell all that thou hast; Give it to the poor;" and "Follow
 16989	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tme;" which are not Commands, but Invitations, and Callings of men to
 16990	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChristianity, like that of Esay 55.1. "Ho, every man that thirsteth,
 16991	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcome yee to the waters, come, and buy wine and milke without money."
 16992	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor first, the Apostles power was no other than that of our Saviour,
 16993	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto invite men to embrace the Kingdome of God; which they themselves
 16994	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tacknowledged for a Kingdome (not present, but) to come; and they that
 16995	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave no Kingdome, can make no Laws. And secondly, if their Acts of
 16996	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCouncell, were Laws, they could not without sin be disobeyed. But we
 16997	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tread not any where, that they who received not the Doctrine of Christ,
 16998	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdid therein sin; but that they died in their sins; that is, that their
 16999	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsins against the Laws to which they owed obedience, were not pardoned.
 17000	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd those Laws were the Laws of Nature, and the Civill Laws of the
 17001	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tState, whereto every Christian man had by pact submitted himself. And
 17002	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore by the Burthen, which the Apostles might lay on such as they
 17003	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thad converted, are not to be understood Laws, but Conditions, proposed
 17004	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto those that sought Salvation; which they might accept, or refuse at
 17005	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir own perill, without a new sin, though not without the hazard of
 17006	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeing condemned, and excluded out of the Kingdome of God for their sins
 17007	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpast. And therefore of Infidels, S. John saith not, the wrath of God
 17008	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshall "come" upon them, but "the wrath of God remaineth upon them;"
 17009	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand not that they shall be condemned; but that "they are condemned
 17010	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talready."(John 3.36, 3.18) Nor can it be conceived, that the benefit
 17011	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Faith, "is Remission of sins" unlesse we conceive withall, that the
 17012	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdammage of Infidelity, is "the Retention of the same sins."
 17013	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17014	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut to what end is it (may some man aske), that the Apostles, and other
 17015	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPastors of the Church, after their time, should meet together, to agree
 17016	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tupon what Doctrine should be taught, both for Faith and Manners, if no
 17017	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman were obliged to observe their Decrees? To this may be answered, that
 17018	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Apostles, and Elders of that Councell, were obliged even by their
 17019	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tentrance into it, to teach the Doctrine therein concluded, and decreed
 17020	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto be taught, so far forth, as no precedent Law, to which they were
 17021	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobliged to yeeld obedience, was to the contrary; but not that all other
 17022	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChristians should be obliged to observe, what they taught. For though
 17023	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey might deliberate what each of them should teach; yet they could
 17024	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot deliberate what others should do, unless their Assembly had had
 17025	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Legislative Power; which none could have but Civill Soveraigns. For
 17026	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthough God be the Soveraign of all the world, we are not bound to take
 17027	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor his Law, whatsoever is propounded by every man in his name; nor any
 17028	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthing contrary to the Civill Law, which God hath expressely commanded us
 17029	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto obey.
 17030	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17031	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSeeing then the Acts of Councell of the Apostles, were then no Laws,
 17032	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut Councells; much lesse are Laws the Acts of any other Doctors,
 17033	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor Councells since, if assembled without the Authority of the Civill
 17034	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign. And consequently, the Books of the New Testament, though most
 17035	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tperfect Rules of Christian Doctrine, could not be made Laws by any other
 17036	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tauthority then that of Kings, or Soveraign Assemblies.
 17037	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17038	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe first Councell, that made the Scriptures we now have, Canon, is not
 17039	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\textant: For that Collection the first Bishop of Rome after S. Peter, is
 17040	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsubject to question: For though the Canonicall books bee there reckoned
 17041	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tup; yet these words, "Sint vobis omnibus Clericis & Laicis Libris
 17042	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tvenerandi, &c." containe a distinction of Clergy, and Laity, that was
 17043	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot in use so neer St. Peters time. The first Councell for setling the
 17044	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCanonicall Scripture, that is extant, is that of Laodicea, Can. 59.
 17045	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich forbids the reading of other Books then those in the Churches;
 17046	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich is a Mandate that is not addressed to every Christian, but to
 17047	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose onely that had authority to read any publiquely in the Church;
 17048	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat is, to Ecclesiastiques onely.

 17053	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf The Right Of Constituting Ecclesiasticall Officers In The Time
 17054	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17055	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf The Apostles
 17056	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17057	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf Ecclesiastical Officers in the time of the Apostles, some were
 17058	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMagisteriall, some Ministeriall. Magisteriall were the Offices
 17059	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof preaching of the Gospel of the Kingdom of God to Infidels; of
 17060	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tadministring the Sacraments, and Divine Service; and of teaching the
 17061	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRules of Faith and Manners to those that were converted. Ministeriall
 17062	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas the Office of Deacons, that is, of them that were appointed to the
 17063	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tadministration of the secular necessities of the Church, at such time
 17064	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas they lived upon a common stock of mony, raised out of the voluntary
 17065	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontributions of the faithfull.
 17066	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17067	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAmongst the Officers Magisteriall, the first, and principall were the
 17068	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tApostles; whereof there were at first but twelve; and these were chosen
 17069	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand constituted by our Saviour himselfe; and their Office was not onely
 17070	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto Preach, Teach, and Baptize, but also to be Martyrs, (Witnesses of
 17071	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tour Saviours Resurrection.) This Testimony, was the specificall, and
 17072	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tessentiall mark; whereby the Apostleship was distinguished from other
 17073	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMagistracy Ecclesiasticall; as being necessary for an Apostle, either to
 17074	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave seen our Saviour after his Resurrection, or to have conversed with
 17075	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim before, and seen his works, and other arguments of his Divinity,
 17076	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhereby they might be taken for sufficient Witnesses. And therefore at
 17077	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe election of a new Apostle in the place of Judas Iscariot, S. Peter
 17078	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsaith (Acts 1.21,22.) "Of these men that have companyed with us, all the
 17079	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttime that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, beginning from the
 17080	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBaptisme of John unto that same day that he was taken up from us, must
 17081	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tone be ordained to be a Witnesse with us of his Resurrection:" where, by
 17082	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis word Must, is implyed a necessary property of an Apostle, to have
 17083	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcompanyed with the first and prime Apostles in the time that our Saviour
 17084	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmanifested himself in the flesh.

 17089	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMatthias Made Apostle By The Congregation.
 17090	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17091	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe first Apostle, of those which were not constituted by Christ in the
 17092	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttime he was upon the Earth, was Matthias, chosen in this manner: There
 17093	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere assembled together in Jerusalem about 120 Christians (Acts 1.15.)
 17094	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThese appointed two, Joseph the Just, and Matthias (ver. 23.) and caused
 17095	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlots to be drawn; "and (ver. 26.) the Lot fell on Matthias and he was
 17096	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnumbred with the Apostles." So that here we see the ordination of this
 17097	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tApostle, was the act of the Congregation, and not of St. Peter, nor of
 17098	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe eleven, otherwise then as Members of the Assembly.

 17103	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPaul And Barnabas Made Apostles By The Church Of Antioch
 17104	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17105	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAfter him there was never any other Apostle ordained, but Paul and
 17106	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBarnabas, which was done (as we read Acts 13.1,2,3.) in this manner.
 17107	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"There were in the Church that was at Antioch, certaine Prophets, and
 17108	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTeachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of
 17109	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCyrene, and Manaen; which had been brought up with Herod the Tetrarch,
 17110	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Saul. As they ministred unto the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost
 17111	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsaid, 'Separate mee Barnabas, and Saul for the worke whereunto I have
 17112	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcalled them.' And when they had fasted, and prayed, and laid their hands
 17113	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ton them, they sent them away."
 17114	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17115	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBy which it is manifest, that though they were called by the Holy Ghost,
 17116	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir Calling was declared unto them, and their Mission authorized by
 17117	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe particular Church of Antioch. And that this their calling was to
 17118	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Apostleship, is apparent by that, that they are both called (Acts
 17119	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t14.14.) Apostles: And that it was by vertue of this act of the Church of
 17120	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAntioch, that they were Apostles, S. Paul declareth plainly (Rom. 1.1.)
 17121	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin that hee useth the word, which the Holy Ghost used at his calling:
 17122	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor he stileth himself, "An Apostle separated unto the Gospel of God;"
 17123	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talluding to the words of the Holy Ghost, "Separate me Barnabas and Saul,
 17124	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t&c." But seeing the work of an Apostle, was to be a Witnesse of
 17125	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Resurrection of Christ, and man may here aske, how S. Paul that
 17126	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconversed not with our Saviour before his passion, could know he was
 17127	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trisen. To which it is easily answered, that our Saviour himself appeared
 17128	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto him in the way to Damascus, from Heaven, after his Ascension; "and
 17129	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tchose him for a vessell to bear his name before the Gentiles, and Kings,
 17130	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Children of Israel;" and consequently (having seen the Lord after
 17131	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this passion) was a competent Witnesse of his Resurrection: And as for
 17132	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBarnabas, he was a Disciple before the Passion. It is therefore evident
 17133	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat Paul, and Barnabas were Apostles; and yet chosen, and authorized
 17134	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(not by the first Apostles alone, but) by the Church of Antioch; as
 17135	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMatthias was chosen, and authorized by the Church of Jerusalem.

 17140	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhat Offices In The Church Are Magisteriall
 17141	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17142	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBishop, a word formed in our language, out of the Greek Episcopus,
 17143	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsignifieth an overseer, or Superintendent of any businesse, and
 17144	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tparticularly a Pastor or Shepherd; and thence by metaphor was taken, not
 17145	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tonly amongst the Jews that were originally Shepherds, but also amongst
 17146	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Heathen, to signifie the Office of a King, or any other Ruler,
 17147	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor Guide of People, whether he ruled by Laws, or Doctrine. And so
 17148	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Apostles were the first Christian Bishops, instituted by Christ
 17149	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thimselfe: in which sense the Apostleship of Judas is called (Acts 1.20.)
 17150	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this Bishoprick. And afterwards, when there were constituted Elders in
 17151	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Christian Churches, with charge to guide Christs flock by their
 17152	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdoctrine, and advice; these Elders were also called Bishops. Timothy was
 17153	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tan Elder (which word Elder, in the New Testament is a name of Office, as
 17154	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twell as of Age;) yet he was also a Bishop. And Bishops were then content
 17155	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith the Title of Elders. Nay S. John himselfe, the Apostle beloved of
 17156	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tour Lord, beginneth his Second Epistle with these words, "The Elder to
 17157	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Elect Lady." By which it is evident, that Bishop, Pastor, Elder,
 17158	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDoctor, that is to say, Teacher, were but so many divers names of
 17159	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe same Office in the time of the Apostles. For there was then no
 17160	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgovernment by Coercion, but only by Doctrine, and Perswading. The
 17161	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKingdome of God was yet to come, in a new world; so that there could
 17162	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe no authority to compell in any Church, till the Common-wealth
 17163	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thad embraced the Christian Faith; and consequently no diversity of
 17164	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAuthority, though there were diversity of Employments.
 17165	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17166	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBesides these Magisteriall employments in the Church, namely Apostles,
 17167	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBishops, Elders, Pastors, and Doctors, whose calling was to proclaim
 17168	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChrist to the Jews, and Infidels, and to direct, and teach those that
 17169	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeleeved we read in the New Testament of no other. For by the names
 17170	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Evangelists and Prophets, is not signified any Office, but severall
 17171	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGifts, by which severall men were profitable to the Church: as
 17172	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEvangelists, by writing the life and acts of our Saviour; such as were
 17173	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tS. Matthew and S. John Apostles, and S. Marke and S. Luke Disciples, and
 17174	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhosoever else wrote of that subject, (as S. Thomas, and S. Barnabas are
 17175	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsaid to have done, though the Church have not received the Books
 17176	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat have gone under their names:) and as Prophets, by the gift of
 17177	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinterpreting the Old Testament; and sometimes by declaring their
 17178	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tspeciall Revelations to the Church. For neither these gifts, nor the
 17179	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgifts of Languages, nor the gift of Casting out Devils, or of Curing
 17180	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother diseases, nor any thing else did make an Officer in the Church,
 17181	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsave onely the due calling and election to the charge of Teaching.

 17186	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOrdination Of Teachers
 17187	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17188	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAs the Apostles, Matthias, Paul, and Barnabas, were not made by our
 17189	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSaviour himself, but were elected by the Church, that is, by the
 17190	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAssembly of Christians; namely, Matthias by the Church of Jerusalem,
 17191	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Paul, and Barnabas by the Church of Antioch; so were also the
 17192	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPresbyters, and Pastors in other Cities, elected by the Churches of
 17193	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose Cities. For proof whereof, let us consider, first, how S. Paul
 17194	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tproceeded in the Ordination of Presbyters, in the Cities where he had
 17195	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconverted men to the Christian Faith, immediately after he and Barnabas
 17196	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thad received their Apostleship. We read (Acts 14.23.) that "they
 17197	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tordained Elders in every Church;" which at first sight may be taken for
 17198	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tan Argument, that they themselves chose, and gave them their authority:
 17199	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut if we consider the Originall text, it will be manifest, that they
 17200	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere authorized, and chosen by the Assembly of the Christians of each
 17201	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCity. For the words there are, "cheirotonesantes autoispresbuterous kat
 17202	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tekklesian," that is, "When they had Ordained them Elders by the Holding
 17203	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tup of Hands in every Congregation." Now it is well enough known, that in
 17204	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall those Cities, the manner of choosing Magistrates, and Officers,
 17205	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas by plurality of suffrages; and (because the ordinary way of
 17206	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdistinguishing the Affirmative Votes from the Negatives, was by Holding
 17207	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tup of Hands) to ordain an Officer in any of the Cities, was no more
 17208	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut to bring the people together, to elect them by plurality of Votes,
 17209	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhether it were by plurality of elevated hands, or by plurality of
 17210	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tvoices, or plurality of balls, or beans, or small stones, of which every
 17211	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman cast in one, into a vessell marked for the Affirmative, or Negative;
 17212	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor divers Cities had divers customes in that point. It was therefore
 17213	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Assembly that elected their own Elders: the Apostles were onely
 17214	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPresidents of the Assembly to call them together for such Election, and
 17215	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto pronounce them Elected, and to give them the benediction, which now
 17216	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis called Consecration. And for this cause they that were Presidents
 17217	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Assemblies, as (in the absence of the Apostles) the Elders were,
 17218	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere called proestotes, and in Latin Antistities; which words signifie
 17219	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Principall Person of the Assembly, whose office was to number the
 17220	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tVotes, and to declare thereby who was chosen; and where the Votes were
 17221	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tequall, to decide the matter in question, by adding his own; which is
 17222	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Office of a President in Councell. And (because all the Churches
 17223	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thad their Presbyters ordained in the same manner,) where the word is
 17224	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConstitute, (as Titus 1.5.) "ina katasteses kata polin presbuterous,"
 17225	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest constitute
 17226	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tElders in every City," we are to understand the same thing; namely, that
 17227	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thee should call the faithfull together, and ordain them Presbyters by
 17228	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tplurality of suffrages. It had been a strange thing, if in a Town, where
 17229	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen perhaps had never seen any Magistrate otherwise chosen then by an
 17230	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAssembly, those of the Town becomming Christians, should so much as have
 17231	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthought on any other way of Election of their Teachers, and Guides, that
 17232	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis to say, of their Presbyters, (otherwise called Bishops,) then this of
 17233	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tplurality of suffrages, intimated by S. Paul (Acts 14.23.) in the word
 17234	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCheirotonesantes: Nor was there ever any choosing of Bishops, (before
 17235	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Emperors found it necessary to regulate them in order to the keeping
 17236	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the peace amongst them,) but by the Assemblies of the Christians in
 17237	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevery severall Town.
 17238	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17239	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe same is also confirmed by the continuall practise even to this day,
 17240	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the Election of the Bishops of Rome. For if the Bishop of any place,
 17241	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thad the right of choosing another, to the succession of the Pastorall
 17242	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOffice, in any City, at such time as he went from thence, to plant the
 17243	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsame in another place; much more had he had the Right, to appoint his
 17244	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuccessour in that place, in which he last resided and dyed: And we find
 17245	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot, that ever any Bishop of Rome appointed his successor. For they were
 17246	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta long time chosen by the People, as we may see by the sedition raised
 17247	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tabout the Election, between Damascus, and Ursinicus; which Ammianus
 17248	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMarcellinus saith was so great, that Juventius the Praefect, unable to
 17249	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tkeep the peace between them, was forced to goe out of the City; and that
 17250	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere were above an hundred men found dead upon that occasion in the
 17251	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChurch it self. And though they afterwards were chosen, first, by the
 17252	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhole Clergy of Rome, and afterwards by the Cardinalls; yet never any
 17253	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas appointed to the succession by his predecessor. If therefore they
 17254	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpretended no right to appoint their successors, I think I may reasonably
 17255	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconclude, they had no right to appoint the new power; which none could
 17256	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttake from the Church to bestow on them, but such as had a lawfull
 17257	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tauthority, not onely to Teach, but to Command the Church; which none
 17258	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcould doe, but the Civill Soveraign.

 17263	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMinisters Of The Church What
 17264	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17265	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe word Minister in the Originall Diakonos signifieth one that
 17266	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tvoluntarily doth the businesse of another man; and differeth from a
 17267	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tServant onely in this, that Servants are obliged by their condition,
 17268	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto what is commanded them; whereas Ministers are obliged onely by
 17269	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir undertaking, and bound therefore to no more than that they have
 17270	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tundertaken: So that both they that teach the Word of God, and they that
 17271	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tadminister the secular affairs of the Church, are both Ministers, but
 17272	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey are Ministers of different Persons. For the Pastors of the Church,
 17273	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcalled (Acts 6.4.) "The Ministers of the Word," are Ministers of Christ,
 17274	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhose Word it is: But the Ministery of a Deacon, which is called (verse
 17275	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t2. of the same Chapter) "Serving of Tables," is a service done to the
 17276	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChurch, or Congregation: So that neither any one man, nor the whole
 17277	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChurch, could ever of their Pastor say, he was their Minister; but of
 17278	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Deacon, whether the charge he undertook were to serve tables, or
 17279	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdistribute maintenance to the Christians, when they lived in each City
 17280	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ton a common stock, or upon collections, as in the first times, or to
 17281	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttake a care of the House of Prayer, or of the Revenue, or other worldly
 17282	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbusinesse of the Church, the whole Congregation might properly call him
 17283	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir Minister.
 17284	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17285	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor their employment, as Deacons, was to serve the Congregation; though
 17286	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tupon occasion they omitted not to preach the Gospel, and maintain the
 17287	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDoctrine of Christ, every one according to his gifts, as S. Steven did;
 17288	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand both to Preach, and Baptize, as Philip did: For that Philip, which
 17289	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(Act. 8. 5.) Preached the Gospel at Samaria, and (verse 38.) Baptized
 17290	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Eunuch, was Philip the Deacon, not Philip the Apostle. For it is
 17291	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmanifest (verse 1.) that when Philip preached in Samaria, the Apostles
 17292	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere at Jerusalem, and (verse 14.) "When they heard that Samaria had
 17293	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treceived the Word of God, sent Peter and John to them;" by imposition of
 17294	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhose hands, they that were Baptized (verse 15.) received (which before
 17295	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby the Baptisme of Philip they had not received) the Holy Ghost. For it
 17296	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas necessary for the conferring of the Holy Ghost, that their Baptisme
 17297	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshould be administred, or confirmed by a Minister of the Word, not by a
 17298	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMinister of the Church. And therefore to confirm the Baptisme of those
 17299	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat Philip the Deacon had Baptized, the Apostles sent out of their own
 17300	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnumber from Jerusalem to Samaria, Peter, and John; who conferred on them
 17301	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat before were but Baptized, those graces that were signs of the Holy
 17302	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSpirit, which at that time did accompany all true Beleevers; which what
 17303	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey were may be understood by that which S. Marke saith (chap. 16.17.)
 17304	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"These signs follow them that beleeve in my Name; they shall cast out
 17305	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDevills; they shall speak with new tongues; They shall take up Serpents,
 17306	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; They shall
 17307	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlay hands on the sick, and they shall recover." This to doe, was it that
 17308	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPhilip could not give; but the Apostles could, and (as appears by this
 17309	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tplace) effectually did to every man that truly beleeved, and was by
 17310	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Minister of Christ himself Baptized: which power either Christs
 17311	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMinisters in this age cannot conferre, or else there are very few true
 17312	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBeleevers, or Christ hath very few Ministers.

 17318	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17319	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThat the first Deacons were chosen, not by the Apostles, but by a
 17320	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCongregation of the Disciples; that is, of Christian men of all sorts,
 17321	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis manifest out of Acts 6. where we read that the Twelve, after the
 17322	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnumber of Disciples was multiplyed, called them together, and having
 17323	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttold them, that it was not fit that the Apostles should leave the Word
 17324	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof God, and serve tables, said unto them (verse 3.) "Brethren looke you
 17325	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tout among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost, and of
 17326	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWisdome, whom we may appoint over this businesse." Here it is manifest,
 17327	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat though the Apostles declared them elected; yet the Congregation
 17328	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tchose them; which also, (verse the fift) is more expressely said, where
 17329	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit is written, that "the saying pleased the multitude, and they chose
 17330	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tseven, &c."

 17337	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tUnder the Old Testament, the Tribe of Levi were onely capable of the
 17338	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPriesthood, and other inferiour Offices of the Church. The land
 17339	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas divided amongst the other Tribes (Levi excepted,) which by the
 17340	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsubdivision of the Tribe of Joseph, into Ephraim and Manasses, were
 17341	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tstill twelve. To the Tribe of Levi were assigned certain Cities for
 17342	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir habitation, with the suburbs for their cattell: but for their
 17343	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tportion, they were to have the tenth of the fruits of the land of their
 17344	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBrethren. Again, the Priests for their maintenance had the tenth of that
 17345	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttenth, together with part of the oblations, and sacrifices. For God had
 17346	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsaid to Aaron (Numb. 18. 20.) "Thou shalt have no inheritance in their
 17347	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tland, neither shalt thou have any part amongst them, I am thy part, and
 17348	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthine inheritance amongst the Children of Israel." For God being then
 17349	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKing, and having constituted the Tribe of Levi to be his Publique
 17350	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMinisters, he allowed them for their maintenance, the Publique revenue,
 17351	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat is to say, the part that God had reserved to himself; which were
 17352	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTythes, and Offerings: and that it is which is meant, where God saith, I
 17353	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tam thine inheritance. And therefore to the Levites might not unfitly
 17354	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe attributed the name of Clergy from Kleros, which signifieth Lot, or
 17355	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInheritance; not that they were heirs of the Kingdome of God, more than
 17356	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother; but that Gods inheritance, was their maintenance. Now seeing
 17357	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin this time God himself was their King, and Moses, Aaron, and the
 17358	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsucceeding High Priests were his Lieutenants; it is manifest, that the
 17359	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRight of Tythes, and Offerings was constituted by the Civill Power.
 17360	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17361	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAfter their rejection of God in the demand of a King, they enjoyed still
 17362	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe same revenue; but the Right thereof was derived from that, that the
 17363	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKings did never take it from them: for the Publique Revenue was at
 17364	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe disposing of him that was the Publique Person; and that (till the
 17365	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCaptivity) was the King. And again, after the return from the Captivity,
 17366	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey paid their Tythes as before to the Priest. Hitherto therefore
 17367	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChurch Livings were determined by the Civill Soveraign.

 17372	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn Our Saviours Time, And After
 17373	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17374	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf the maintenance of our Saviour, and his Apostles, we read onely they
 17375	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thad a Purse, (which was carried by Judas Iscariot;) and, that of the
 17376	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tApostles, such as were Fisher-men, did sometimes use their trade; and
 17377	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat when our Saviour sent the Twelve Apostles to Preach, he forbad them
 17378	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"to carry Gold, and Silver, and Brasse in their purses, for that
 17379	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe workman is worthy of his hire:" (Mat. 10. 9,10.) By which it
 17380	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis probable, their ordinary maintenance was not unsuitable to their
 17381	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\temployment; for their employment was (ver. 8.) "freely to give, because
 17382	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey had freely received;" and their maintenance was the Free Gift of
 17383	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose that beleeved the good tyding they carryed about of the coming
 17384	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Messiah their Saviour. To which we may adde, that which was
 17385	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontributed out of gratitude, by such as our Saviour had healed of
 17386	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdiseases; of which are mentioned "Certain women (Luke 8. 2,3.) which had
 17387	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeen healed of evill spirits and infirmities; Mary Magdalen, out of whom
 17388	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twent seven Devills; and Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herods Steward; and
 17389	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSusanna, and many others, which ministred unto him of their substance.
 17390	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17391	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAfter our Saviours Ascension, the Christians of every City lived in
 17392	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon, (Acts 4. 34.) upon the mony which was made of the sale of their
 17393	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlands and possessions, and laid down at the feet of the Apostles, of
 17394	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgood will, not of duty; for "whilest the Land remained (saith S. Peter
 17395	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto Ananias Acts 5.4.) was it not thine? and after it was sold, was it
 17396	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot in thy power?" which sheweth he needed not to have saved his land,
 17397	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnor his money by lying, as not being bound to contribute any thing at
 17398	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall, unlesse he had pleased. And as in the time of the Apostles, so also
 17399	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall the time downward, till after Constantine the Great, we shall
 17400	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfind, that the maintenance of the Bishops, and Pastors of the Christian
 17401	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChurch, was nothing but the voluntary contribution of them that had
 17402	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tembraced their Doctrine. There was yet no mention of Tythes: but
 17403	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch was in the time of Constantine, and his Sons, the affection of
 17404	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChristians to their Pastors, as Ammianus Marcellinus saith (describing
 17405	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe sedition of Damasus and Ursinicus about the Bishopricke,) that it
 17406	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas worth their contention, in that the Bishops of those times by the
 17407	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tliberality of their flock, and especially of Matrons, lived splendidly,
 17408	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere carryed in Coaches, and sumptuous in their fare and apparell.
 17409	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17410	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Ministers Of The Gospel Lived On The Benevolence Of Their Flocks
 17411	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut here may some ask, whether the Pastor were then bound to live upon
 17412	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tvoluntary contribution, as upon almes, "For who (saith S. Paul 1 Cor. 9.
 17413	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t7.) goeth to war at his own charges? or who feedeth a flock, and eatheth
 17414	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot of the milke of the flock?" And again, (1 Cor. 9. 13.) "Doe ye not
 17415	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tknow that they which minister about holy things, live of the things of
 17416	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Temple; and they which wait at the Altar, partake with the Altar;"
 17417	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat is to say, have part of that which is offered at the Altar for
 17418	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir maintenance? And then he concludeth, "Even so hath the Lord
 17419	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tappointed, that they which preach the Gospel should live of the Gospel.
 17420	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFrom which place may be inferred indeed, that the Pastors of the Church
 17421	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tought to be maintained by their flocks; but not that the Pastors were to
 17422	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdetermine, either the quantity, or the kind of their own allowance, and
 17423	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe (as it were) their own Carvers. Their allowance must needs therefore
 17424	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe determined, either by the gratitude, and liberality of every
 17425	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tparticular man of their flock, or by the whole Congregation. By the
 17426	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhole Congregation it could not be, because their Acts were then no
 17427	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaws: Therefore the maintenance of Pastors, before Emperours and Civill
 17428	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraigns had made Laws to settle it, was nothing but Benevolence. They
 17429	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat served at the Altar lived on what was offered. In what court should
 17430	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey sue for it, who had no Tribunalls? Or if they had Arbitrators
 17431	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tamongst themselves, who should execute their Judgments, when they had no
 17432	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpower to arme their Officers? It remaineth therefore, that there could
 17433	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe no certaine maintenance assigned to any Pastors of the Church, but by
 17434	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe whole Congregation; and then onely, when their Decrees should have
 17435	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe force (not onely of Canons, but also) of Laws; which Laws could not
 17436	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe made, but by Emperours, Kings, or other Civill Soveraignes. The Right
 17437	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Tythes in Moses Law, could not be applyed to the then Ministers
 17438	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Gospell; because Moses and the High Priests were the Civill
 17439	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraigns of the people under God, whose Kingdom amongst the Jews was
 17440	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpresent; whereas the Kingdome of God by Christ is yet to come.
 17441	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17442	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHitherto hath been shewn what the Pastors of the Church are; what are
 17443	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe points of their Commission (as that they were to Preach, to Teach,
 17444	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto Baptize, to be Presidents in their severall Congregations;) what is
 17445	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEcclesiasticall Censure, viz. Excommunication, that is to say, in those
 17446	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tplaces where Christianity was forbidden by the Civill Laws, a putting
 17447	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof themselves out of the company of the Excommunicate, and where
 17448	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChristianity was by the Civill Law commanded, a putting the
 17449	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tExcommunicate out of the Congregations of Christians; who elected the
 17450	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPastors and Ministers of the Church, (that it was, the Congregation);
 17451	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twho consecrated and blessed them, (that it was the Pastor); what was
 17452	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir due revenue, (that it was none but their own possessions,
 17453	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand their own labour, and the voluntary contributions of devout and
 17454	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgratefull Christians). We are to consider now, what Office those persons
 17455	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave, who being Civill Soveraignes, have embraced also the Christian
 17456	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFaith.
 17457	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17458	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17459	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17460	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17461	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Civill Soveraign Being A Christian Hath The Right Of Appointing
 17462	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17463	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPastors
 17464	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17465	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd first, we are to remember, that the Right of Judging what
 17466	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDoctrines are fit for Peace, and to be taught the Subjects, is in all
 17467	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealths inseparably annexed (as hath been already proved cha.
 17468	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t18.) to the Soveraign Power Civill, whether it be in one Man, or in one
 17469	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAssembly of men. For it is evident to the meanest capacity, that mens
 17470	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tactions are derived from the opinions they have of the Good, or Evill,
 17471	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich from those actions redound unto themselves; and consequently,
 17472	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen that are once possessed of an opinion, that their obedience to
 17473	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Soveraign Power, will bee more hurtfull to them, than their
 17474	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdisobedience, will disobey the Laws, and thereby overthrow the
 17475	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth, and introduce confusion, and Civill war; for the avoiding
 17476	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhereof, all Civill Government was ordained. And therefore in all
 17477	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealths of the Heathen, the Soveraigns have had the name of
 17478	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPastors of the People, because there was no Subject that could lawfully
 17479	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTeach the people, but by their permission and authority.
 17480	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17481	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThis Right of the Heathen Kings, cannot bee thought taken from them by
 17482	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir conversion to the Faith of Christ; who never ordained, that Kings
 17483	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor beleeving in him, should be deposed, that is, subjected to any but
 17484	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thimself, or (which is all one) be deprived of the power necessary for
 17485	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe conservation of Peace amongst their Subjects, and for their defence
 17486	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagainst foraign Enemies. And therefore Christian Kings are still the
 17487	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSupreme Pastors of their people, and have power to ordain what Pastors
 17488	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey please, to teach the Church, that is, to teach the People committed
 17489	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto their charge.
 17490	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17491	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAgain, let the right of choosing them be (as before the conversion
 17492	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Kings) in the Church, for so it was in the time of the Apostles
 17493	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthemselves (as hath been shewn already in this chapter); even so also
 17494	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Right will be in the Civill Soveraign, Christian. For in that he is
 17495	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Christian, he allowes the Teaching; and in that he is the Soveraign
 17496	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(which is as much as to say, the Church by Representation,) the
 17497	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTeachers hee elects, are elected by the Church. And when an Assembly of
 17498	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChristians choose their Pastor in a Christian Common-wealth, it is the
 17499	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign that electeth him, because tis done by his Authority; In the
 17500	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsame manner, as when a Town choose their Maior, it is the act of him
 17501	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat hath the Soveraign Power: For every act done, is the act of him,
 17502	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twithout whose consent it is invalid. And therefore whatsoever examples
 17503	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmay be drawn out of History, concerning the Election of Pastors, by the
 17504	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPeople, or by the Clergy, they are no arguments against the Right of
 17505	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tany Civill Soveraign, because they that elected them did it by his
 17506	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAuthority.
 17507	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17508	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSeeing then in every Christian Common-wealth, the Civill Soveraign is
 17509	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Supreme Pastor, to whose charge the whole flock of his Subjects is
 17510	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommitted, and consequently that it is by his authority, that all
 17511	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother Pastors are made, and have power to teach, and performe all
 17512	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother Pastorall offices; it followeth also, that it is from the Civill
 17513	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign, that all other Pastors derive their right of Teaching,
 17514	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPreaching, and other functions pertaining to that Office; and that they
 17515	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare but his Ministers; in the same manner as the Magistrates of Towns,
 17516	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJudges in Courts of Justice, and Commanders of Armies, are all but
 17517	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMinisters of him that is the Magistrate of the whole Common-wealth,
 17518	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJudge of all Causes, and Commander of the whole Militia, which is
 17519	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talwayes the Civill Soveraign. And the reason hereof, is not because they
 17520	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat Teach, but because they that are to Learn, are his Subjects.
 17521	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor let it be supposed, that a Christian King commit the Authority of
 17522	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOrdaining Pastors in his Dominions to another King, (as divers Christian
 17523	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKings allow that power to the Pope;) he doth not thereby constitute a
 17524	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPastor over himself, nor a Soveraign Pastor over his People; for that
 17525	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere to deprive himself of the Civill Power; which depending on the
 17526	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\topinion men have of their Duty to him, and the fear they have of
 17527	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPunishment in another world, would depend also on the skill, and loyalty
 17528	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Doctors, who are no lesse subject, not only to Ambition, but also
 17529	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto Ignorance, than any other sort of men. So that where a stranger hath
 17530	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tauthority to appoint Teachers, it is given him by the Soveraign in
 17531	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhose Dominions he teacheth. Christian Doctors are our Schoolmasters
 17532	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto Christianity; But Kings are Fathers of Families, and may receive
 17533	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSchoolmasters for their Subjects from the recommendation of a stranger,
 17534	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut not from the command; especially when the ill teaching them shall
 17535	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tredound to the great and manifest profit of him that recommends them:
 17536	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnor can they be obliged to retain them, longer than it is for the
 17537	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPublique good; the care of which they stand so long charged withall, as
 17538	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey retain any other essentiall Right of the Soveraignty.
 17539	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17540	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17541	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17542	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17543	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Pastorall Authority Of Soveraigns Only Is De Jure Divino,
 17544	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17545	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThat Of Other Pastors Is Jure Civili
 17546	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17547	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIf a man therefore should ask a Pastor, in the execution of his Office,
 17548	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas the chief Priests and Elders of the people (Mat. 21.23.) asked our
 17549	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSaviour, "By what authority dost thou these things, and who gave thee
 17550	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis authority:" he can make no other just Answer, but that he doth
 17551	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit by the Authority of the Common-wealth, given him by the King, or
 17552	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAssembly that representeth it. All Pastors, except the Supreme, execute
 17553	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir charges in the Right, that is by the Authority of the Civill
 17554	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign, that is, Jure Civili. But the King, and every other Soveraign
 17555	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texecuteth his Office of Supreme Pastor, by immediate Authority from God,
 17556	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat is to say, In Gods Right, or Jure Divino. And therefore none but
 17557	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKings can put into their Titles (a mark of their submission to God onely
 17558	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t) Dei Gratia Rex, &c. Bishops ought to say in the beginning of their
 17559	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMandates, "By the favour of the Kings Majesty, Bishop of such a
 17560	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDiocesse;" or as Civill Ministers, "In his Majesties Name." For in
 17561	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsaying, Divina Providentia, which is the same with Dei Gratia, though
 17562	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdisguised, they deny to have received their authority from the Civill
 17563	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tState; and sliely slip off the Collar of their Civill Subjection,
 17564	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontrary to the unity and defence of the Common-wealth.
 17565	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17566	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t

 17569	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChristian Kings Have Power To Execute All Manner Of Pastoral Function
 17570	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17571	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut if every Christian Soveraign be the Supreme Pastor of his own
 17572	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSubjects, it seemeth that he hath also the Authority, not only to Preach
 17573	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(which perhaps no man will deny;) but also to Baptize, and to Administer
 17574	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Sacrament of the Lords Supper; and to Consecrate both Temples, and
 17575	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPastors to Gods service; which most men deny; partly because they use
 17576	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot to do it; and partly because the Administration of Sacraments,
 17577	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Consecration of Persons, and Places to holy uses, requireth the
 17578	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tImposition of such mens hands, as by the like Imposition successively
 17579	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom the time of the Apostles have been ordained to the like Ministery.
 17580	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor proof therefore that Christian Kings have power to Baptize, and to
 17581	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConsecrate, I am to render a reason, both why they use not to doe it,
 17582	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand how, without the ordinary ceremony of Imposition of hands, they are
 17583	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmade capable of doing it, when they will.
 17584	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17585	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThere is no doubt but any King, in case he were skilfull in the
 17586	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSciences, might by the same Right of his Office, read Lectures of
 17587	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem himself, by which he authorizeth others to read them in the
 17588	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tUniversities. Neverthelesse, because the care of the summe of the
 17589	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbusinesse of the Common-wealth taketh up his whole time, it were not
 17590	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconvenient for him to apply himself in Person to that particular. A King
 17591	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmay also if he please, sit in Judgment, to hear and determine all manner
 17592	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Causes, as well as give others authority to doe it in his name; but
 17593	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat the charge that lyeth upon him of Command and Government, constrain
 17594	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim to bee continually at the Helm, and to commit the Ministeriall
 17595	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOffices to others under him. In the like manner our Saviour (who surely
 17596	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thad power to Baptize) Baptized none himselfe, but sent his Apostles and
 17597	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDisciples to Baptize. (John 4.2.) So also S. Paul, by the necessity of
 17598	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPreaching in divers and far distant places, Baptized few: Amongst all
 17599	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Corinthians he Baptized only Crispus, Cajus, and Stephanus; (1
 17600	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCor.1.14,16.) and the reason was, because his principall Charge was to
 17601	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPreach. (1 Cor. 1.17.) Whereby it is manifest, that the greater Charge,
 17602	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(such as is the Government of the Church,) is a dispensation for the
 17603	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlesse. The reason therefore why Christian Kings use not to Baptize, is
 17604	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevident, and the same, for which at this day there are few Baptized by
 17605	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBishops, and by the Pope fewer.
 17606	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17607	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd as concerning Imposition of Hands, whether it be needfull, for the
 17608	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tauthorizing of a King to Baptize, and Consecrate, we may consider thus.
 17609	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17610	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tImposition of Hands, was a most ancient publique ceremony amongst the
 17611	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJews, by which was designed, and made certain, the person, or other
 17612	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthing intended in a mans prayer, blessing, sacrifice, consecration,
 17613	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcondemnation, or other speech. So Jacob in blessing the children of
 17614	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJoseph (Gen. 48.14.) "Laid his right Hand on Ephraim the younger, and
 17615	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this left Hand on Manasseh the first born;" and this he did Wittingly
 17616	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(though they were so presented to him by Joseph, as he was forced in
 17617	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdoing it to stretch out his arms acrosse) to design to whom he intended
 17618	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe greater blessing. So also in the sacrificing of the Burnt offering,
 17619	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAaron is commanded (Exod. 29.10.) "to Lay his Hands on the head of the
 17620	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbullock;" and (ver. 15.) "to Lay his Hand on the head of the ramme."
 17621	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe same is also said again, Levit. 1.4. & 8.14. Likewise Moses when he
 17622	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tordained Joshua to be Captain of the Israelites, that is, consecrated
 17623	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim to Gods service, (Numb. 27.23.) "Laid his hands upon him, and gave
 17624	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim his Charge," designing and rendring certain, who it was they were
 17625	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto obey in war. And in the consecration of the Levites (Numb. 8.10.) God
 17626	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommanded that "the Children of Israel should Put their Hands upon the
 17627	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLevites." And in the condemnation of him that had blasphemed the Lord
 17628	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(Levit. 24.14.) God commanded that "all that heard him should Lay their
 17629	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHands on his head, and that all the Congregation should stone him." And
 17630	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhy should they only that heard him, Lay their Hands upon him, and not
 17631	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trather a Priest, Levite, or other Minister of Justice, but that
 17632	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnone else were able to design, and demonstrate to the eyes of the
 17633	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCongregation, who it was that had blasphemed, and ought to die? And
 17634	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto design a man, or any other thing, by the Hand to the Eye is lesse
 17635	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsubject to mistake, than when it is done to the Eare by a Name.
 17636	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17637	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd so much was this ceremony observed, that in blessing the whole
 17638	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCongregation at once, which cannot be done by Laying on of Hands, yet
 17639	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"Aaron (Levit. 9.22.) did lift up his Hand towards the people when he
 17640	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tblessed them." And we read also of the like ceremony of Consecration of
 17641	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTemples amongst the Heathen, as that the Priest laid his Hands on
 17642	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsome post of the Temple, all the while he was uttering the words of
 17643	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConsecration. So naturall it is to design any individuall thing, rather
 17644	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby the Hand, to assure the Eyes, than by Words to inform the Eare in
 17645	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmatters of Gods Publique service.
 17646	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17647	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThis ceremony was not therefore new in our Saviours time. For Jairus
 17648	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(Mark 5.23.) whose daughter was sick, besought our Saviour (not to heal
 17649	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ther, but) "to Lay his Hands upon her, that shee might bee healed." And
 17650	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(Matth. 19.13.) "they brought unto him little children, that hee should
 17651	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPut his Hands on them, and Pray."
 17652	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17653	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAccording to this ancient Rite, the Apostles, and Presbyters, and the
 17654	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPresbytery it self, Laid Hands on them whom they ordained Pastors, and
 17655	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twithall prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost; and that
 17656	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot only once, but sometimes oftner, when a new occasion was presented:
 17657	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut the end was still the same, namely a punctuall, and religious
 17658	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdesignation of the person, ordained either to the Pastorall Charge
 17659	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin general, or to a particular Mission: so (Act. 6.6.) "The Apostles
 17660	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPrayed, and Laid their Hands" on the seven Deacons; which was done,
 17661	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot to give them the Holy Ghost, (for they were full of the Holy Ghost
 17662	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbefore thy were chosen, as appeareth immediately before, verse 3.) but
 17663	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto design them to that Office. And after Philip the Deacon had converted
 17664	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcertain persons in Samaria, Peter and John went down (Act. 8.17.)" and
 17665	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlaid their Hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost." And not
 17666	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tonly an Apostle, but a Presbyter had this power: For S. Paul adviseth
 17667	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTimothy (1 Tim. 5.22.) "Lay Hands suddenly on no man;" that is, designe
 17668	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tno man rashly to the Office of a Pastor. The whole Presbytery Laid their
 17669	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHands on Timothy, as we read 1 Tim. 4.14. but this is to be understood,
 17670	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas that some did it by the appointment of the Presbytery, and most
 17671	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlikely their Proestos, or Prolocutor, which it may be was St. Paul
 17672	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thimself. For in his 2 Epist. to Tim. ver. 6. he saith to him, "Stirre up
 17673	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe gift of God which is in thee, by the Laying on of my Hands:" where
 17674	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnote by the way, that by the Holy ghost, is not meant the third Person
 17675	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the Trinity, but the Gifts necessary to the Pastorall Office. We read
 17676	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talso, that St. Paul had Imposition of Hands twice; once from Ananias at
 17677	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDamascus (Acts 9.17,18.) at the time of his Baptisme; and again (Acts
 17678	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t13.3.) at Antioch, when he was first sent out to Preach. The use then of
 17679	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis ceremony considered in the Ordination of Pastors, was to design
 17680	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Person to whom they gave such Power. But if there had been then any
 17681	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChristian, that had had the Power of Teaching before; the Baptizing of
 17682	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim, that is the making of him a Christian, had given him no new Power,
 17683	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut had onely caused him to preach true Doctrine, that is, to use
 17684	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this Power aright; and therefore the Imposition of Hands had been
 17685	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunnecessary; Baptisme it selfe had been sufficient. But every Soveraign,
 17686	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbefore Christianity, had the power of Teaching, and Ordaining Teachers;
 17687	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand therefore Christianity gave them no new Right, but only directed
 17688	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem in the way of teaching truth; and consequently they needed
 17689	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tno Imposition of Hands (besides that which is done in Baptisme) to
 17690	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tauthorize them to exercise any part of the Pastorall Function, as
 17691	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnamely, to Baptize, and Consecrate. And in the Old Testament, though
 17692	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Priest only had right to Consecrate, during the time that the
 17693	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraignty was in the High Priest; yet it was not so when the
 17694	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraignty was in the King: For we read (1 Kings 8.) That Solomon
 17695	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBlessed the People, Consecrated the Temple, and pronounced that Publique
 17696	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPrayer, which is the pattern now for Consecration of all Christian
 17697	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChurches, and Chappels: whereby it appears, he had not only the right
 17698	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Ecclesiasticall Government; but also of exercising Ecclesiasticall
 17699	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFunctions.
 17700	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t

 17704	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Civill Soveraigne If A Christian, Is Head Of The Church
 17705	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17706	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn His Own Dominions
 17707	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17708	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFrom this consolidation of the Right Politique, and Ecclesiastique in
 17709	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChristian Soveraigns, it is evident, they have all manner of Power over
 17710	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir Subjects, that can be given to man, for the government of mens
 17711	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texternall actions, both in Policy, and Religion; and may make such
 17712	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaws, as themselves shall judge fittest, for the government of their
 17713	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\town Subjects, both as they are the Common-wealth, and as they are the
 17714	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChurch: for both State, and Church are the same men.
 17715	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17716	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIf they please therefore, they may (as many Christian Kings now doe)
 17717	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommit the government of their Subjects in matters of Religion to
 17718	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Pope; but then the Pope is in that point Subordinate to them, and
 17719	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texerciseth that Charge in anothers Dominion Jure Civili, in the Right of
 17720	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Civill Soveraign; not Jure Divino, in Gods Right; and may therefore
 17721	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe discharged of that Office, when the Soveraign for the good of his
 17722	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSubjects shall think it necessary. They may also if they please,
 17723	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommit the care of Religion to one Supreme Pastor, or to an Assembly of
 17724	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPastors; and give them what power over the Church, or one over another,
 17725	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey think most convenient; and what titles of honor, as of Bishops,
 17726	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tArchbishops, Priests, or Presbyters, they will; and make such Laws for
 17727	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir maintenance, either by Tithes, or otherwise, as they please,
 17728	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tso they doe it out of a sincere conscience, of which God onely is
 17729	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Judge. It is the Civill Soveraign, that is to appoint Judges, and
 17730	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInterpreters of the Canonicall Scriptures; for it is he that maketh them
 17731	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaws. It is he also that giveth strength to Excommunications; which but
 17732	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor such Laws and Punishments, as may humble obstinate Libertines, and
 17733	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treduce them to union with the rest of the Church, would bee
 17734	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontemned. In summe, he hath the Supreme Power in all causes, as well
 17735	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEcclesiasticall, as Civill, as far as concerneth actions, and words, for
 17736	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthese onely are known, and may be accused; and of that which cannot be
 17737	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\taccused, there is no Judg at all, but God, that knoweth the heart.
 17738	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd these Rights are incident to all Soveraigns, whether Monarchs, or
 17739	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAssemblies: for they that are the Representants of a Christian People,
 17740	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare Representants of the Church: for a Church, and a Common-wealth of
 17741	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChristian People, are the same thing.

 17748	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThough this that I have here said, and in other places of this Book,
 17749	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tseem cleer enough for the asserting of the Supreme Ecclesiasticall Power
 17750	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto Christian Soveraigns; yet because the Pope of Romes challenge to that
 17751	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPower universally, hath been maintained chiefly, and I think as strongly
 17752	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas is possible, by Cardinall Bellarmine, in his Controversie De Summo
 17753	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPontifice; I have thought it necessary, as briefly as I can, to examine

 17759	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe First Book
 17760	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17761	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf five Books he hath written of this subject, the first containeth
 17762	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthree Questions: One, Which is simply the best government, Monarchy,
 17763	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAristocracy, or Democracy; and concludeth for neither, but for a
 17764	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgovernment mixt of all there: Another, which of these is the best
 17765	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGovernment of the Church; and concludeth for the mixt, but which should
 17766	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmost participate of Monarchy: the third, whether in this mixt Monarchy,
 17767	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSt. Peter had the place of Monarch. Concerning his first Conclusion, I
 17768	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave already sufficiently proved (chapt. 18.) that all Governments which
 17769	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen are bound to obey, are Simple, and Absolute. In Monarchy there is
 17770	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut One Man Supreme; and all other men that have any kind of Power in
 17771	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe State, have it by his Commission, during his pleasure; and execute
 17772	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit in his name: And in Aristocracy, and Democracy, but One Supreme
 17773	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAssembly, with the same Power that in Monarchy belongeth to the Monarch,
 17774	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich is not a Mixt, but an Absolute Soveraignty. And of the three
 17775	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsorts, which is the best, is not to be disputed, where any one of them
 17776	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis already established; but the present ought alwaies to be preferred,
 17777	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmaintained, and accounted best; because it is against both the Law of
 17778	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNature, and the Divine positive Law, to doe any thing tending to the
 17779	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsubversion thereof. Besides, it maketh nothing to the Power of
 17780	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tany Pastor, (unlesse he have the Civill Soveraignty,) what kind of
 17781	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGovernment is the best; because their Calling is not to govern men by
 17782	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommandement, but to teach them, and perswade them by Arguments, and
 17783	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tleave it to them to consider, whether they shall embrace, or reject the
 17784	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDoctrine taught. For Monarchy, Aristocracy, and Democracy, do mark out
 17785	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunto us three sorts of Soveraigns, not of Pastors; or, as we may say,
 17786	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthree sorts of Masters of Families, not three sorts of Schoolmasters for
 17787	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir children.
 17788	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17789	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd therefore the second Conclusion, concerning the best form of
 17790	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGovernment of the Church, is nothing to the question of the Popes Power
 17791	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twithout his own Dominions: For in all other Common-wealths his Power (if
 17792	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thee have any at all) is that of the Schoolmaster onely, and not of the
 17793	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMaster of the Family.
 17794	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17795	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor the third Conclusion, which is, that St. Peter was Monarch of the
 17796	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChurch, he bringeth for his chiefe argument the place of S. Matth.
 17797	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(chap. 16.18, 19.) "Thou art Peter, And upon this rock I will build my
 17798	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChurch, &c. And I will give thee the keyes of Heaven; whatsoever thou
 17799	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshalt bind on Earth, shall be bound in Heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt
 17800	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tloose on Earth, shall be loosed in Heaven." Which place well considered,
 17801	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tproveth no more, but that the Church of Christ hath for foundation one
 17802	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tonely Article; namely, that which Peter in the name of all the Apostles
 17803	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprofessing, gave occasion to our Saviour to speak the words here cited;
 17804	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich that wee may cleerly understand, we are to consider, that our
 17805	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSaviour preached by himself, by John Baptist, and by his Apostles,
 17806	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnothing but this Article of Faith, "that he was the Christ;" all other
 17807	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tArticles requiring faith no otherwise, than as founded on that. John
 17808	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbegan first, (Mat. 3.2.) preaching only this, "The Kingdome of God is at
 17809	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thand." Then our Saviour himself (Mat. 4.17.) preached the same: And to
 17810	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this Twelve Apostles, when he gave them their Commission (Mat. 10.7.)
 17811	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere is no mention of preaching any other Article but that. This was
 17812	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe fundamentall Article, that is the Foundation of the Churches Faith.
 17813	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAfterwards the Apostles being returned to him, he asketh them all, (Mat.
 17814	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t16.13) not Peter onely, "Who men said he was;" and they answered, that
 17815	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"some said he was John the Baptist, some Elias, and others Jeremias,
 17816	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor one of the Prophets:" Then (ver. 15.) he asked them all again, (not
 17817	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPeter onely) "Whom say yee that I am?" Therefore Peter answered (for
 17818	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem all) "Thou art Christ, the Son of the Living God;" which I said is
 17819	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Foundation of the Faith of the whole Church; from which our Saviour
 17820	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttakes the occasion of saying, "Upon this stone I will build my Church;"
 17821	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBy which it is manifest, that by the Foundation-Stone of the Church, was
 17822	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmeant the Fundamentall Article of the Churches Faith. But why then (will
 17823	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsome object) doth our Saviour interpose these words, "Thou art Peter"?
 17824	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIf the originall of this text had been rigidly translated, the reason
 17825	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twould easily have appeared: We are therefore to consider, that the
 17826	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tApostle Simon, was surnamed Stone, (which is the signification of
 17827	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Syriacke word Cephas, and of the Greek word Petrus). Our Saviour
 17828	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore after the confession of that Fundamentall Article, alluding
 17829	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto his name, said (as if it were in English) thus, Thou art "Stone," and
 17830	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tupon this Stone I will build my Church: which is as much as to say, this
 17831	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tArticle, that "I am the Christ," is the Foundation of all the Faith I
 17832	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trequire in those that are to bee members of my Church: Neither is this
 17833	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tallusion to a name, an unusuall thing in common speech: But it had been
 17834	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta strange, and obscure speech, if our Saviour intending to build his
 17835	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChurch on the Person of St. Peter, had said, "thou art a Stone, and
 17836	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tupon this Stone I will build my Church," when it was so obvious without
 17837	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tambiguity to have said, "I will build my Church on thee; and yet there
 17838	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thad been still the same allusion to his name.
 17839	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17840	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd for the following words, "I will give thee the Keyes of Heaven, &c."
 17841	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit is no more than what our Saviour gave also to all the rest of his
 17842	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDisciples (Matth. 18.18.) "Whatsoever yee shall bind on Earth, shall be
 17843	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbound in Heaven. And whatsoever ye shall loose on Earth, shall be loosed
 17844	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin Heaven." But howsoever this be interpreted, there is no doubt but
 17845	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Power here granted belongs to all Supreme Pastors; such as are all
 17846	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChristian Civill Soveraignes in their own Dominions. In so much, as if
 17847	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSt. Peter, or our Saviour himself had converted any of them to beleeve
 17848	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim, and to acknowledge his Kingdome; yet because his Kingdome is not of
 17849	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis world, he had left the supreme care of converting his subjects to
 17850	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnone but him; or else hee must have deprived him of the Soveraignty,
 17851	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto which the Right of Teaching is inseparably annexed. And thus much in
 17852	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trefutation of his first Book, wherein hee would prove St. Peter to have
 17853	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeen the Monarch Universall of the Church, that is to say, of all the
 17854	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChristians in the world.

 17860	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17861	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe second Book hath two Conclusions: One, that S. Peter was Bishop
 17862	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Rome, and there dyed: The other, that the Popes of Rome are his
 17863	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSuccessors. Both which have been disputed by others. But supposing them
 17864	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto be true; yet if by Bishop of Rome bee understood either the
 17865	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMonarch of the Church, or the Supreme Pastor of it; not Silvester, but
 17866	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConstantine (who was the first Christian Emperour) was that Bishop; and
 17867	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas Constantine, so all other Christian Emperors were of Right supreme
 17868	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBishops of the Roman Empire; I say of the Roman Empire, not of all
 17869	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChristendome: For other Christian Soveraigns had the same Right in their
 17870	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tseverall Territories, as to an Office essentially adhaerent to their
 17871	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraignty. Which shall serve for answer to his second Book.

 17875	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17876	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Third Book
 17877	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17878	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn the third Book, he handleth the question whether the Pope be
 17879	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAntichrist. For my part, I see no argument that proves he is so, in that
 17880	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsense that Scripture useth the name: nor will I take any argument from
 17881	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe quality of Antichrist, to contradict the Authority he exerciseth,
 17882	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor hath heretofore exercised in the Dominions of any other Prince, or
 17883	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tState.
 17884	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17885	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIt is evident that the Prophets of the Old Testament foretold, and the
 17886	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJews expected a Messiah, that is, a Christ, that should re-establish
 17887	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tamongst them the kingdom of God, which had been rejected by them in
 17888	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe time of Samuel, when they required a King after the manner of
 17889	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother Nations. This expectation of theirs, made them obnoxious to the
 17890	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tImposture of all such, as had both the ambition to attempt the attaining
 17891	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Kingdome, and the art to deceive the People by counterfeit
 17892	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmiracles, by hypocriticall life, or by orations and doctrine plausible.
 17893	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOur Saviour therefore, and his Apostles forewarned men of False
 17894	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tProphets, and of False Christs. False Christs, are such as pretend to
 17895	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe the Christ, but are not, and are called properly Antichrists, in such
 17896	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsense, as when there happeneth a Schisme in the Church by the election
 17897	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof two Popes, the one calleth the other Antipapa, or the false Pope.
 17898	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd therefore Antichrist in the proper signification hath two essentiall
 17899	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmarks; One, that he denyeth Jesus to be Christ; and another that he
 17900	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprofesseth himselfe to bee Christ. The first Mark is set down by S. John
 17901	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin his 1 Epist. 4. ch. 3. ver. "Every Spirit that confesseth not that
 17902	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJesus Christ is come in the flesh, is not of God; And this is the Spirit
 17903	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Antichrist." The other Mark is expressed in the words of our Saviour,
 17904	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(Mat. 24.5.) "Many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ;" and
 17905	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagain, "If any man shall say unto you, Loe, here is Christ, there is
 17906	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChrist beleeve it not." And therefore Antichrist must be a False Christ,
 17907	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat is, some one of them that shall pretend themselves to be Christ.
 17908	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd out of these two Marks, "to deny Jesus to be the Christ," and to
 17909	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"affirm himselfe to be the Christ," it followeth, that he must also be
 17910	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tan "Adversary of the true Christ," which is another usuall signification
 17911	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the word Antichrist. But of these many Antichrists, there is one
 17912	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tspeciall one, O Antichristos, The Antichrist, or Antichrist definitely,
 17913	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas one certaine person; not indefinitely An Antichrist. Now seeing the
 17914	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPope of Rome, neither pretendeth himself, nor denyeth Jesus to be the
 17915	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChrist, I perceive not how he can be called Antichrist; by which word
 17916	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis not meant, one that falsely pretendeth to be His Lieutenant, or Vicar
 17917	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGenerall, but to be Hee. There is also some Mark of the time of this
 17918	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tspeciall Antichrist, as (Mat. 24.15.) when that abominable Destroyer,
 17919	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tspoken of by Daniel, (Dan. 9. 27.) shall stand in the Holy place, and
 17920	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch tribulation as was not since the beginning of the world, nor ever
 17921	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshall be again, insomuch as if it were to last long, (ver. 22.) "no
 17922	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tflesh could be saved; but for the elects sake those days shall be
 17923	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshortened" (made fewer). But that tribulation is not yet come; for it
 17924	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis to be followed immediately (ver. 29.) by a darkening of the Sun
 17925	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Moon, a falling of the Stars, a concussion of the Heavens, and the
 17926	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tglorious coming again of our Saviour, in the cloudes. And therefore The
 17927	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAntichrist is not yet come; whereas, many Popes are both come and gone.
 17928	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIt is true, the Pope in taking upon him to give Laws to all Christian
 17929	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKings, and Nations, usurpeth a Kingdome in this world, which Christ took
 17930	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot on him: but he doth it not As Christ, but as For Christ, wherein
 17931	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere is nothing of the Antichrist.

 17936	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Fourth Book
 17937	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17938	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn the fourth Book, to prove the Pope to be the supreme Judg in all
 17939	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tquestions of Faith and Manners, (which is as much as to be the absolute
 17940	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMonarch of all Christians in the world,) be bringeth three Propositions:
 17941	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe first, that his Judgments are Infallible: The second, that he can
 17942	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmake very Laws, and punish those that observe them not: The third, that
 17943	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tour Saviour conferred all Jurisdiction Ecclesiasticall on the Pope of
 17944	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRome.

 17949	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTexts For The Infallibility Of The Popes Judgement In Points Of Faith
 17950	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17951	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor the Infallibility of his Judgments, he alledgeth the Scriptures: and
 17952	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfirst, that of Luke 22.31. "Simon, Simon, Satan hath desired you that
 17953	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thee may sift you as wheat; but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith
 17954	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfaile not; and when thou art converted, strengthen thy Brethren." This,
 17955	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\taccording to Bellarmines exposition, is, that Christ gave here to Simon
 17956	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPeter two priviledges: one, that neither his Faith should fail, neither
 17957	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the, nor any of his successors should ever define any point concerning
 17958	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFaith, or Manners erroneously, or contrary to the definition of a former
 17959	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPope: Which is a strange, and very much strained interpretation. But he
 17960	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat with attention readeth that chapter, shall find there is no place
 17961	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the whole Scripture, that maketh more against the Popes Authority,
 17962	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthan this very place. The Priests and Scribes seeking to kill our
 17963	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSaviour at the Passeover, and Judas possessed with a resolution to
 17964	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbetray him, and the day of killing the Passeover being come, our Saviour
 17965	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcelebrated the same with his Apostles, which he said, till the Kingdome
 17966	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof God was come hee would doe no more; and withall told them, that one
 17967	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof them was to betray him: Hereupon they questioned, which of them it
 17968	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshould be; and withall (seeing the next Passeover their Master would
 17969	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcelebrate should be when he was King) entred into a contention, who
 17970	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshould then be the greater man. Our Saviour therefore told them, that
 17971	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Kings of the Nations had Dominion over their Subjects, and are
 17972	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcalled by a name (in Hebrew) that signifies Bountifull; but I cannot
 17973	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe so to you, you must endeavour to serve one another; I ordain you a
 17974	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKingdome, but it is such as my Father hath ordained mee; a Kingdome that
 17975	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tI am now to purchase with my blood, and not to possesse till my second
 17976	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcoming; then yee shall eat and drink at my Table, and sit on Thrones,
 17977	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tjudging the twelve Tribes of Israel: And then addressing himself to
 17978	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSt. Peter, he saith, Simon, Simon, Satan seeks by suggesting a present
 17979	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdomination, to weaken your faith of the future; but I have prayed for
 17980	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthee, that thy faith shall not fail; Thou therefore (Note this,) being
 17981	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconverted, and understanding my Kingdome as of another world, confirm
 17982	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe same faith in thy Brethren: To which S. Peter answered (as one that
 17983	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tno more expected any authority in this world) "Lord I am ready to goe
 17984	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith thee, not onely to Prison, but to Death." Whereby it is manifest,
 17985	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tS. Peter had not onely no jurisdiction given him in this world, but a
 17986	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcharge to teach all the other Apostles, that they also should have none.
 17987	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd for the Infallibility of St. Peters sentence definitive in matter
 17988	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Faith, there is no more to be attributed to it out of this Text, than
 17989	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat Peter should continue in the beleef of this point, namely, that
 17990	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChrist should come again, and possesse the Kingdome at the day of
 17991	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJudgement; which was not given by the Text to all his Successors; for
 17992	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twee see they claim it in the World that now is.
 17993	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 17994	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe second place is that of Matth. 16. "Thou art Peter, and upon this
 17995	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trocke I will build my Church, and the gates of Hell shall not prevail
 17996	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagainst it." By which (as I have already shewn in this chapter) is
 17997	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tproved no more, than that the gates of Hell shall not prevail against
 17998	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe confession of Peter, which gave occasion to that speech; namely
 17999	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis, That Jesus Is Christ The Sonne Of God.
 18000	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18001	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe third text is John 21. ver. 16,17. "Feed my sheep;" which contains
 18002	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tno more but a Commission of Teaching: And if we grant the rest of the
 18003	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tApostles to be contained in that name of Sheep; then it is the supreme
 18004	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPower of Teaching: but it was onely for the time that there were no
 18005	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChristian Soveraigns already possessed of that Supremacy. But I have
 18006	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talready proved, that Christian Soveraignes are in their owne Dominions
 18007	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe supreme Pastors, and instituted thereto, by vertue of their being
 18008	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBaptized, though without other Imposition of Hands. For such imposition
 18009	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeing a Ceremony of designing the person, is needlesse, when hee is
 18010	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talready designed to the Power of Teaching what Doctrine he will, by his
 18011	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinstitution to an Absolute Power over his Subjects. For as I have proved
 18012	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbefore, Soveraigns are supreme Teachers (in generall) by their Office
 18013	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand therefore oblige themselves (by their Baptisme) to teach the
 18014	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDoctrine of Christ: And when they suffer others to teach their people,
 18015	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey doe it at the perill of their own souls; for it is at the hands
 18016	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Heads of Families that God will require the account of the
 18017	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinstruction of his Children and Servants. It is of Abraham himself,
 18018	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot of a hireling, that God saith (Gen. 18.19) "I know him that he will
 18019	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommand his Children, and his houshold after him, that they keep the way
 18020	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Lord, and do justice and judgement.
 18021	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18022	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe fourth place is that of Exod. 28.30. "Thou shalt put in the
 18023	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBreastplate of Judgment, the Urim and the Thummin:" which hee saith is
 18024	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinterpreted by the Septuagint, delosin kai aletheian, that is, Evidence
 18025	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Truth: And thence concludeth, God had given Evidence, and Truth,
 18026	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(which is almost infallibility,) to the High Priest. But be it Evidence
 18027	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Truth it selfe that was given; or be it but Admonition to the Priest
 18028	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto endeavour to inform himself cleerly, and give judgment uprightly;
 18029	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tyet in that it was given to the High Priest, it was given to the Civill
 18030	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign: For next under God was the High Priest in the Common-wealth
 18031	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Israel; and is an argument for Evidence and Truth, that is, for the
 18032	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEcclesiasticall Supremacy of Civill Soveraigns over their own Subjects,
 18033	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagainst the pretended Power of the Pope. These are all the Texts hee
 18034	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbringeth for the Infallibility of the Judgement of the Pope, in point of
 18035	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFaith.
 18036	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18037	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t

 18039	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18040	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTexts For The Same In Point Of Manners
 18041	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18042	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor the Infallibility of his Judgment concerning Manners, hee bringeth
 18043	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tone Text, which is that of John 16.13. "When the Spirit of truth is
 18044	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcome, hee will lead you into all truth" where (saith he) by All Truth,
 18045	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis meant, at least, All Truth Necessary To Salvation. But with this
 18046	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmitigation, he attributeth no more Infallibility to the Pope, than to
 18047	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tany man that professeth Christianity, and is not to be damned: For
 18048	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tif any man erre in any point, wherein not to erre is necessary to
 18049	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSalvation, it is impossible he should be saved; for that onely is
 18050	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnecessary to Salvation, without which to be saved is impossible. What
 18051	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpoints these are, I shall declare out of the Scripture in the Chapter
 18052	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfollowing. In this place I say no more, but that though it were granted,
 18053	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Pope could not possibly teach any error at all, yet doth not this
 18054	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tentitle him to any Jurisdiction in the Dominions of another Prince,
 18055	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunlesse we shall also say, a man is obliged in conscience to set on
 18056	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twork upon all occasions the best workman, even then also when he hath
 18057	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tformerly promised his work to another.
 18058	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18059	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBesides the Text, he argueth from Reason, thus, If the Pope could erre
 18060	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin necessaries, then Christ hath not sufficiently provided for the
 18061	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChurches Salvation; because he hath commanded her to follow the Popes
 18062	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdirections. But this Reason is invalid, unlesse he shew when, and where
 18063	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChrist commanded that, or took at all any notice of a Pope: Nay granting
 18064	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhatsoever was given to S. Peter was given to the Pope; yet seeing there
 18065	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis in the Scripture no command to any man to obey St. Peter, no man can
 18066	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbee just, that obeyeth him, when his commands are contrary to those of
 18067	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this lawfull Soveraign.
 18068	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18069	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLastly, it hath not been declared by the Church, nor by the Pope
 18070	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thimselfe, that he is the Civill Soveraign of all the Christians in the
 18071	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tworld; and therefore all Christians are not bound to acknowledge his
 18072	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJurisdiction in point of Manners. For the Civill Soveraignty, and
 18073	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsupreme Judicature in controversies of Manners, are the same thing: And
 18074	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Makers of Civill Laws, are not onely Declarers, but also Makers
 18075	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the justice, and injustice of actions; there being nothing in mens
 18076	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tManners that makes them righteous, or unrighteous, but their conformity
 18077	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith the Law of the Soveraign. And therefore when the Pope challengeth
 18078	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSupremacy in controversies of Manners, hee teacheth men to disobey the
 18079	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCivill Soveraign; which is an erroneous Doctrine, contrary to the
 18080	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmany precepts of our Saviour and his Apostles, delivered to us in the
 18081	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tScripture.
 18082	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18083	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo prove the Pope has Power to make Laws, he alledgeth many places; as
 18084	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfirst, Deut. 17.12. "The man that will doe presumptuously, and will not
 18085	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thearken unto the Priest, (that standeth to Minister there before the
 18086	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLord thy God, or unto the Judge,) even that man shall die, and thou
 18087	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshalt put away the evill from Israel." For answer whereunto, we are to
 18088	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tremember that the High Priest (next and immediately under God) was the
 18089	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCivill Soveraign; and all Judges were to be constituted by him. The
 18090	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twords alledged sound therefore thus. "The man that will presume to
 18091	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdisobey the Civill Soveraign for the time being, or any of his Officers
 18092	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the execution of their places, that man shall die, &c." which is
 18093	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcleerly for the Civill Soveraignty, against the Universall power of the
 18094	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPope.
 18095	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18096	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSecondly, he alledgeth that of Matth. 16. "Whatsoever yee shall bind,
 18097	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t&c." and interpreteth it for such Binding as is attributed (Matth.
 18098	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t23.4.) to the Scribes and Pharisees, "They bind heavy burthens, and
 18099	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgrievous to be born, and lay them on mens shoulders;" by which is meant
 18100	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(he sayes) Making of Laws; and concludes thence, the Pope can make
 18101	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaws. But this also maketh onely for the Legislative power of Civill
 18102	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraigns: For the Scribes, and Pharisees sat in Moses Chaire,
 18103	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut Moses next under God was Soveraign of the People of Israel: and
 18104	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore our Saviour commanded them to doe all that they should say,
 18105	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut not all that they should do. That is, to obey their Laws, but not
 18106	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfollow their Example.
 18107	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18108	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe third place, is John 21.16. "Feed my sheep;" which is not a Power
 18109	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto make Laws, but a command to Teach. Making Laws belongs to the Lord of
 18110	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Family; who by his owne discretion chooseth his Chaplain, as also a
 18111	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSchoolmaster to Teach his children.
 18112	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18113	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe fourth place John 20.21. is against him. The words are, "As my
 18114	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFather sent me, so send I you." But our Saviour was sent to Redeem (by
 18115	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this Death) such as should Beleeve; and by his own, and his Apostles
 18116	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpreaching to prepare them for their entrance into his Kingdome; which he
 18117	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thimself saith, is not of this world, and hath taught us to pray for the
 18118	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcoming of it hereafter, though hee refused (Acts 1.6,7.) to tell his
 18119	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tApostles when it should come; and in which, when it comes, the twelve
 18120	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tApostles shall sit on twelve Thrones (every one perhaps as high as that
 18121	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof St. Peter) to judge the twelve tribes of Israel. Seeing then God the
 18122	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFather sent not our Saviour to make Laws in this present world, wee may
 18123	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconclude from the Text, that neither did our Saviour send S. Peter to
 18124	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmake Laws here, but to perswade men to expect his second comming with
 18125	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta stedfast faith; and in the mean time, if Subjects, to obey their
 18126	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPrinces; and if Princes, both to beleeve it themselves, and to do their
 18127	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbest to make their Subjects doe the same; which is the Office of a
 18128	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBishop. Therefore this place maketh most strongly for the joining of the
 18129	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEcclesiasticall Supremacy to the Civill Soveraignty, contrary to that
 18130	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich Cardinall Bellarmine alledgeth it for.
 18131	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18132	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe fift place is Acts 15.28. "It hath seemed good to the Holy Spirit,
 18133	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand to us, to lay upon you no greater burden, than these necessary
 18134	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthings, that yee abstaine from meats offered to Idols, and from bloud,
 18135	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand from things strangled, and from fornication." Here hee notes the
 18136	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tword Laying Of Burdens for the Legislative Power. But who is there,
 18137	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat reading this Text, can say, this stile of the Apostles may not as
 18138	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tproperly be used in giving Counsell, as in making Laws? The stile of a
 18139	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaw is, We Command: But, We Think Good, is the ordinary stile of them,
 18140	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat but give Advice; and they lay a Burthen that give Advice, though
 18141	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit bee conditionall, that is, if they to whom they give it, will
 18142	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tattain their ends: And such is the Burthen, of abstaining from things
 18143	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tstrangled, and from bloud; not absolute, but in case they will not
 18144	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\terre. I have shewn before (chap. 25.) that Law, is distinguished from
 18145	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCounsell, in this, that the reason of a Law, is taken from the designe,
 18146	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand benefit of him that prescribeth it; but the reason of a Counsell,
 18147	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom the designe, and benefit of him, to whom the Counsell is given. But
 18148	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\there, the Apostles aime onely at the benefit of the converted Gentiles,
 18149	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnamely their Salvation; not at their own benefit; for having done their
 18150	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tendeavour, they shall have their reward, whether they be obeyed, or not.
 18151	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd therefore the Acts of this Councell, were not Laws, but Counsells.
 18152	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18153	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe sixt place is that of Rom. 13. "Let every Soul be subject to the
 18154	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHigher Powers, for there is no Power but of God;" which is meant, he
 18155	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsaith not onely of Secular, but also of Ecclesiasticall Princes. To
 18156	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich I answer, first, that there are no Ecclesiasticall Princes but
 18157	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose that are also Civill Soveraignes; and their Principalities exceed
 18158	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot the compasse of their Civill Soveraignty; without those bounds
 18159	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthough they may be received for Doctors, they cannot be acknowledged for
 18160	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPrinces. For if the Apostle had meant, we should be subject both to our
 18161	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\town Princes, and also to the Pope, he had taught us a doctrine, which
 18162	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChrist himself hath told us is impossible, namely, "to serve two
 18163	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMasters." And though the Apostle say in another place, "I write these
 18164	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthings being absent, lest being present I should use sharpnesse,
 18165	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\taccording to the Power which the Lord hath given me;" it is not, that
 18166	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the challenged a Power either to put to death, imprison, banish, whip,
 18167	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor fine any of them, which are Punishments; but onely to Excommunicate,
 18168	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich (without the Civill Power) is no more but a leaving of their
 18169	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcompany, and having no more to doe with them, than with a Heathen man,
 18170	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor a Publican; which in many occasions might be a greater pain to the
 18171	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tExcommunicant, than to the Excommunicate.
 18172	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18173	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe seventh place is 1 Cor. 4.21. "Shall I come unto you with a Rod, or
 18174	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin love, and the spirit of lenity?" But here again, it is not the Power
 18175	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof a Magistrate to punish offenders, that is meant by a Rod; but
 18176	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tonely the Power of Excommunication, which is not in its owne nature
 18177	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Punishment, but onely a Denouncing of punishment, that Christ shall
 18178	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinflict, when he shall be in possession of his Kingdome, at the day of
 18179	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJudgment. Nor then also shall it bee properly a Punishment, as upon a
 18180	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSubject that hath broken the Law; but a Revenge, as upon an Enemy, or
 18181	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRevolter, that denyeth the Right of our Saviour to the Kingdome: And
 18182	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore this proveth not the Legislative Power of any Bishop, that has
 18183	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot also the Civill Power.
 18184	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18185	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe eighth place is, Timothy 3.2. "A Bishop must be the husband but of
 18186	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tone wife, vigilant, sober, &c." which he saith was a Law. I thought that
 18187	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnone could make a Law in the Church, but the Monarch of the Church, St.
 18188	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPeter. But suppose this Precept made by the authority of St. Peter;
 18189	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tyet I see no reason why to call it a Law, rather than an Advice, seeing
 18190	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTimothy was not a Subject, but a Disciple of St. Paul; nor the flock
 18191	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunder the charge of Timothy, his Subjects in the Kingdome, but his
 18192	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tScholars in the Schoole of Christ: If all the Precepts he giveth
 18193	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTimothy, be Laws, why is not this also a Law, "Drink no longer water,
 18194	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut use a little wine for thy healths sake"? And why are not also
 18195	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Precepts of good Physitians, so many Laws? but that it is not the
 18196	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tImperative manner of speaking, but an absolute Subjection to a Person,
 18197	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat maketh his Precept Laws.
 18198	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18199	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn like manner, the ninth place, 1 Tim. 5. 19. "Against an Elder
 18200	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treceive not an accusation, but before two or three Witnesses," is a wise
 18201	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPrecept, but not a Law.
 18202	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18203	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe tenth place is, Luke 10.16. "He that heareth you, heareth mee; and
 18204	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the that despiseth you, despiseth me." And there is no doubt, but he that
 18205	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdespiseth the Counsell of those that are sent by Christ, despiseth
 18206	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Counsell of Christ himself. But who are those now that are sent by
 18207	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChrist, but such as are ordained Pastors by lawfull Authority? and who
 18208	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare lawfully ordained, that are not ordained by the Soveraign
 18209	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPastor? and who is ordained by the Soveraign Pastor in a Christian
 18210	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth, that is not ordained by the authority of the Soveraign
 18211	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthereof? Out of this place therefore it followeth, that he which heareth
 18212	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this Soveraign being a Christian, heareth Christ; and hee that despiseth
 18213	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Doctrine which his King being a Christian, authorizeth, despiseth
 18214	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Doctrine of Christ (which is not that which Bellarmine intendeth
 18215	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\there to prove, but the contrary). But all this is nothing to a Law. Nay
 18216	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmore, a Christian King, as a Pastor, and Teacher of his Subjects, makes
 18217	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot thereby his Doctrines Laws. He cannot oblige men to beleeve; though
 18218	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas a Civill Soveraign he may make Laws suitable to his Doctrine, which
 18219	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmay oblige men to certain actions, and sometimes to such as they would
 18220	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot otherwise do, and which he ought not to command; and yet when
 18221	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey are commanded, they are Laws; and the externall actions done in
 18222	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobedience to them, without the inward approbation, are the actions of
 18223	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Soveraign, and not of the Subject, which is in that case but as
 18224	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tan instrument, without any motion of his owne at all; because God hath
 18225	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommanded to obey them.
 18226	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18227	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe eleventh, is every place, where the Apostle for Counsell, putteth
 18228	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsome word, by which men use to signifie Command; or calleth the
 18229	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfollowing of his Counsell, by the name of Obedience. And therefore they
 18230	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare alledged out of 1 Cor. 11.2. "I commend you for keeping my Precepts
 18231	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas I delivered them to you." The Greek is, "I commend you for keeping
 18232	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose things I delivered to you, as I delivered them." Which is far from
 18233	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsignifying that they were Laws, or any thing else, but good Counsell.
 18234	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd that of 1 Thess. 4.2. "You know what commandements we gave you:"
 18235	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhere the Greek word is paraggelias edokamen, equivalent to paredokamen,
 18236	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhat wee delivered to you, as in the place next before alledged, which
 18237	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdoes not prove the Traditions of the Apostles, to be any more than
 18238	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCounsells; though as is said in the 8th verse, "he that despiseth them,
 18239	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdespiseth not man, but God": For our Saviour himself came not to Judge,
 18240	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat is, to be King in this world; but to Sacrifice himself for Sinners,
 18241	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand leave Doctors in his Church, to lead, not to drive men to Christ,
 18242	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twho never accepteth forced actions, (which is all the Law produceth,)
 18243	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut the inward conversion of the heart; which is not the work of Laws,
 18244	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut of Counsell, and Doctrine.
 18245	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18246	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd that of 2 Thess. 3.14. "If any man Obey not our word by this
 18247	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEpistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may bee
 18248	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tashamed": where from the word Obey, he would inferre, that this Epistle
 18249	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas a Law to the Thessalonians. The Epistles of the Emperours were
 18250	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tindeed Laws. If therefore the Epistle of S. Paul were also a Law, they
 18251	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere to obey two Masters. But the word Obey, as it is in the Greek
 18252	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tupakouei, signifieth Hearkening To, or Putting In Practice, not onely
 18253	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat which is Commanded by him that has right to punish, but also that
 18254	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich is delivered in a way of Counsell for our good; and therefore St.
 18255	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPaul does not bid kill him that disobeys, nor beat, nor imprison, nor
 18256	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tamerce him, which Legislators may all do; but avoid his company, that
 18257	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the may bee ashamed: whereby it is evident, it was not the Empire of an
 18258	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tApostle, but his Reputation amongst the Faithfull, which the Christians
 18259	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tstood in awe of.
 18260	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18261	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe last place is that of Heb. 13.17. "Obey your Leaders, and submit
 18262	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tyour selves to them, for they watch for your souls, as they that must
 18263	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgive account:" And here also is intended by Obedience, a following of
 18264	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir Counsell: For the reason of our Obedience, is not drawn from the
 18265	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twill and command of our Pastors, but from our own benefit, as being the
 18266	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSalvation of our Souls they watch for, and not for the Exaltation of
 18267	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir own Power, and Authority. If it were meant here, that all they
 18268	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tteach were Laws, then not onely the Pope, but every Pastor in his Parish
 18269	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshould have Legislative Power. Again, they that are bound to obey, their
 18270	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPastors, have no power to examine their commands. What then shall wee
 18271	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsay to St. John who bids us (1 Epist. chap. 4. ver. 1.) "Not to beleeve
 18272	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevery Spirit, but to try the Spirits whether they are of God, because
 18273	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmany false Prophets are gone out into the world"? It is therefore
 18274	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmanifest, that wee may dispute the Doctrine of our Pastors; but no man
 18275	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcan dispute a Law. The Commands of Civill Soveraigns are on all sides
 18276	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgranted to be Laws: if any else can make a Law besides himselfe, all
 18277	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth, and consequently all Peace, and Justice must cease; which
 18278	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis contrary to all Laws, both Divine and Humane. Nothing therefore can
 18279	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe drawn from these, or any other places of Scripture, to prove the
 18280	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDecrees of the Pope, where he has not also the Civill Soveraignty, to be
 18281	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaws.
 18282	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18283	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Question Of Superiority Between The Pope And Other Bishops The last
 18284	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpoint hee would prove, is this, "That our Saviour Christ has committed
 18285	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEcclesiasticall Jurisdiction immediately to none but the Pope." Wherein
 18286	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the handleth not the Question of Supremacy between the Pope and Christian
 18287	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKings, but between the Pope and other Bishops. And first, he sayes it is
 18288	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagreed, that the Jurisdiction of Bishops, is at least in the generall
 18289	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDe Jure Divino, that is, in the Right of God; for which he alledges S.
 18290	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPaul, Ephes. 4.11. where hee sayes, that Christ after his Ascension
 18291	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinto heaven, "gave gifts to men, some Apostles, some Prophets, and some
 18292	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEvangelists, and some Pastors, and some Teachers:" And thence inferres,
 18293	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey have indeed their Jurisdiction in Gods Right; but will not grant
 18294	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey have it immediately from God, but derived through the Pope. But if
 18295	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta man may be said to have his Jurisdiction De Jure Divino, and yet not
 18296	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\timmediately; what lawfull Jurisdiction, though but Civill, is there in a
 18297	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChristian Common-wealth, that is not also De Jure Divino? For Christian
 18298	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKings have their Civill Power from God immediately; and the Magistrates
 18299	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunder him exercise their severall charges in vertue of his Commission;
 18300	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twherein that which they doe, is no lesse De Jure Divino Mediato, than
 18301	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat which the Bishops doe, in vertue of the Popes Ordination. All
 18302	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlawfull Power is of God, immediately in the Supreme Governour, and
 18303	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmediately in those that have Authority under him: So that either hee
 18304	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmust grant every Constable in the State, to hold his Office in the Right
 18305	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof God; or he must not hold that any Bishop holds his so, besides the
 18306	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPope himselfe.
 18307	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18308	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut this whole Dispute, whether Christ left the Jurisdiction to the Pope
 18309	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tonely, or to other Bishops also, if considered out of these places where
 18310	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Pope has the Civill Soveraignty, is a contention De Lana Caprina:
 18311	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor none of them (where they are not Soveraigns) has any Jurisdiction
 18312	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tat all. For Jurisdiction is the Power of hearing and determining Causes
 18313	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbetween man and man; and can belong to none, but him that hath the Power
 18314	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto prescribe the Rules of Right and Wrong; that is, to make Laws;
 18315	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand with the Sword of Justice to compell men to obey his Decisions,
 18316	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpronounced either by himself, or by the Judges he ordaineth thereunto;
 18317	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich none can lawfully do, but the Civill Soveraign.
 18318	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18319	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTherefore when he alledgeth out of the 6 of Luke, that our Saviour
 18320	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcalled his Disciples together, and chose twelve of them which he named
 18321	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tApostles, he proveth that he Elected them (all, except Matthias, Paul
 18322	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Barnabas,) and gave them Power and Command to Preach, but not
 18323	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto Judge of Causes between man and man: for that is a Power which
 18324	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the refused to take upon himselfe, saying, "Who made me a Judge, or a
 18325	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDivider, amongst you?" and in another place, "My Kingdome is not of this
 18326	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tworld." But hee that hath not the Power to hear, and determine Causes
 18327	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbetween man and man, cannot be said to have any Jurisdiction at all. And
 18328	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tyet this hinders not, but that our Saviour gave them Power to Preach and
 18329	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBaptize in all parts of the world, supposing they were not by their own
 18330	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlawfull Soveraign forbidden: For to our own Soveraigns Christ himself,
 18331	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand his Apostles have in sundry places expressely commanded us in all
 18332	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthings to be obedient.
 18333	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18334	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe arguments by which he would prove, that Bishops receive their
 18335	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJurisdiction from the Pope (seeing the Pope in the Dominions of other
 18336	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPrinces hath no Jurisdiction himself,) are all in vain. Yet because they
 18337	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprove, on the contrary, that all Bishops receive Jurisdiction when they
 18338	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave it from their Civill Soveraigns, I will not omit the recitall of
 18339	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem.
 18340	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18341	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe first, is from Numbers 11. where Moses not being able alone to
 18342	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tundergoe the whole burthen of administring the affairs of the People of
 18343	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIsrael, God commanded him to choose Seventy Elders, and took part of
 18344	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe spirit of Moses, to put it upon those Seventy Elders: by which it is
 18345	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunderstood, not that God weakened the spirit of Moses, for that had not
 18346	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teased him at all; but that they had all of them their authority from
 18347	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim; wherein he doth truly, and ingenuously interpret that place. But
 18348	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tseeing Moses had the entire Soveraignty in the Common-wealth of the
 18349	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJews, it is manifest, that it is thereby signified, that they had their
 18350	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAuthority from the Civill Soveraign: and therefore that place proveth,
 18351	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat Bishops in every Christian Common-wealth have their Authority from
 18352	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Civill Soveraign; and from the Pope in his own Territories only, and
 18353	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot in the Territories of any other State.
 18354	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18355	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe second argument, is from the nature of Monarchy; wherein all
 18356	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAuthority is in one Man, and in others by derivation from him: But the
 18357	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGovernment of the Church, he says, is Monarchicall. This also makes for
 18358	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChristian Monarchs. For they are really Monarchs of their own people;
 18359	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat is, of their own Church (for the Church is the same thing with a
 18360	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChristian people;) whereas the Power of the Pope, though hee were
 18361	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tS. Peter, is neither Monarchy, nor hath any thing of Archicall, nor
 18362	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCraticall, but onely of Didacticall; For God accepteth not a forced, but
 18363	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta willing obedience.
 18364	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18365	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe third, is, from that the Sea of S. Peter is called by S. Cyprian,
 18366	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Head, the Source, the Roote, the Sun, from whence the Authority
 18367	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Bishops is derived. But by the Law of Nature (which is a better
 18368	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPrinciple of Right and Wrong, than the word of any Doctor that is but
 18369	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta man) the Civill Soveraign in every Common-wealth, is the Head, the
 18370	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSource, the Root, and the Sun, from which all Jurisdiction is derived.
 18371	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd therefore, the Jurisdiction of Bishops, is derived from the Civill
 18372	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign.
 18373	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18374	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe fourth, is taken from the Inequality of their Jurisdictions: For
 18375	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tif God (saith he) had given it them immediately, he had given aswell
 18376	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEquality of Jurisdiction, as of Order: But wee see, some are Bishops but
 18377	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof own Town, some of a hundred Towns, and some of many whole Provinces;
 18378	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich differences were not determined by the command of God; their
 18379	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJurisdiction therefore is not of God, but of Man; and one has a
 18380	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgreater, another a lesse, as it pleaseth the Prince of the Church. Which
 18381	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\targument, if he had proved before, that the Pope had had an Universall
 18382	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJurisdiction over all Christians, had been for his purpose. But seeing
 18383	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat hath not been proved, and that it is notoriously known, the large
 18384	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJurisdiction of the Pope was given him by those that had it, that is,
 18385	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby the Emperours of Rome, (for the Patriarch of Constantinople, upon the
 18386	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsame title, namely, of being Bishop of the Capitall City of the Empire,
 18387	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Seat of the Emperour, claimed to be equal to him,) it followeth,
 18388	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat all other Bishops have their Jurisdiction from the Soveraigns of
 18389	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe place wherein they exercise the same: And as for that cause they
 18390	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave not their Authority De Jure Divino; so neither hath the Pope his De
 18391	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJure Divino, except onely where hee is also the Civill Soveraign.
 18392	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18393	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHis fift argument is this, "If Bishops have their Jurisdiction
 18394	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\timmediately from God, the Pope could not take it from them, for he can
 18395	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdoe nothing contrary to Gods ordination;" And this consequence is good,
 18396	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand well proved. "But, (saith he) the Pope can do this, and has done
 18397	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit." This also is granted, so he doe it in his own Dominions, or in the
 18398	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDominions of any other Prince that hath given him that Power; but not
 18399	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tuniversally, in Right of the Popedome: For that power belongeth to
 18400	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevery Christian Soveraign, within the bounds of his owne Empire, and is
 18401	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinseparable from the Soveraignty. Before the People of Israel had (by
 18402	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe commandment of God to Samuel) set over themselves a King, after the
 18403	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmanner of other Nations, the High Priest had the Civill Government; and
 18404	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnone but he could make, nor depose an inferiour Priest: But that Power
 18405	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas afterwards in the King, as may be proved by this same argument of
 18406	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBellarmine; For if the Priest (be he the High Priest or any other) had
 18407	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this Jurisdiction immediately from God, then the King could not take it
 18408	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom him; "for he could do nothing contrary to Gods ordinance: But it
 18409	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis certain, that King Solomon (1 Kings 2.26.) deprived Abiathar the High
 18410	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPriest of his office, and placed Zadok (verse 35.) in his room. Kings
 18411	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore may in the like manner Ordaine, and Deprive Bishops, as they
 18412	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshall thinke fit, for the well governing of their Subjects.
 18413	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18414	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHis sixth argument is this, If Bishops have their Jurisdiction De Jure
 18415	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDivino (that is, immediately from God,) they that maintaine it, should
 18416	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbring some Word of God to prove it: But they can bring none. The
 18417	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\targument is good; I have therefore nothing to say against it. But it
 18418	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis an argument no lesse good, to prove the Pope himself to have no
 18419	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJurisdiction in the Dominion of any other Prince.
 18420	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18421	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLastly, hee bringeth for argument, the testimony of two Popes, Innocent,
 18422	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Leo; and I doubt not but hee might have alledged, with as good
 18423	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treason, the testimonies of all the Popes almost since S. Peter: For
 18424	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsidering the love of Power naturally implanted in mankind, whosoever
 18425	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere made Pope, he would be tempted to uphold the same opinion.
 18426	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNeverthelesse, they should therein but doe, as Innocent, and Leo did,
 18427	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbear witnesse of themselves, and therefore their witness should not be
 18428	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgood.
 18429	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18430	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18431	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18432	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18433	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf The Popes Temporall Power
 18434	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18435	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn the fift Book he hath four Conclusions. The first is, "That the Pope
 18436	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin not Lord of all the world:" the second, "that the Pope is not Lord
 18437	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof all the Christian world:" The third, "That the Pope (without his owne
 18438	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTerritory) has not any Temporall Jurisdiction DIRECTLY:" These three
 18439	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConclusions are easily granted. The fourth is, "That the Pope has (in
 18440	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Dominions of other Princes) the Supreme Temporall Power INDIRECTLY:"
 18441	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich is denyed; unlesse he mean by Indirectly, that he has gotten it by
 18442	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIndirect means; then is that also granted. But I understand, that
 18443	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhen he saith he hath it Indirectly, he means, that such Temporall
 18444	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJurisdiction belongeth to him of Right, but that this Right is but a
 18445	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConsequence of his Pastorall Authority, the which he could not exercise,
 18446	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunlesse he have the other with it: And therefore to the Pastorall Power
 18447	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(which he calls Spirituall) the Supreme Power Civill is necessarily
 18448	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tannexed; and that thereby hee hath a Right to change Kingdomes, giving
 18449	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem to one, and taking them from another, when he shall think it
 18450	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconduces to the Salvation of Souls.
 18451	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18452	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBefore I come to consider the Arguments by which hee would prove this
 18453	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdoctrine, it will not bee amisse to lay open the Consequences of it;
 18454	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat Princes, and States, that have the Civill Soveraignty in their
 18455	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tseverall Common-wealths, may bethink themselves, whether it bee
 18456	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconvenient for them, and conducing to the good of their Subjects, of
 18457	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhom they are to give an account at the day of Judgment, to admit the
 18458	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsame.
 18459	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18460	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhen it is said, the Pope hath not (in the Territories of other States)
 18461	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Supreme Civill Power Directly; we are to understand, he doth
 18462	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot challenge it, as other Civill Soveraigns doe, from the originall
 18463	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsubmission thereto of those that are to be governed. For it is evident,
 18464	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand has already been sufficiently in this Treatise demonstrated, that
 18465	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Right of all Soveraigns, is derived originally from the consent of
 18466	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevery one of those that are to bee governed; whether they that choose
 18467	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim, doe it for their common defence against an Enemy, as when they
 18468	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagree amongst themselves to appoint a Man, or an Assembly of men to
 18469	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprotect them; or whether they doe it, to save their lives, by submission
 18470	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto a conquering Enemy. The Pope therefore, when he disclaimeth the
 18471	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSupreme Civill Power over other States Directly, denyeth no more, but
 18472	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat his Right cometh to him by that way; He ceaseth not for all that,
 18473	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto claime it another way; and that is, (without the consent of them
 18474	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat are to be governed) by a Right given him by God, (which hee calleth
 18475	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIndirectly,) in his Assumption to the Papacy. But by what way soever he
 18476	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpretend, the Power is the same; and he may (if it bee granted to be his
 18477	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRight) depose Princes and States, as often as it is for the Salvation
 18478	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Soules, that is, as often as he will; for he claimeth also the Sole
 18479	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPower to Judge, whether it be to the salvation of mens Souls, or not.
 18480	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd this is the Doctrine, not onely that Bellarmine here, and many other
 18481	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDoctors teach in their Sermons and Books, but also that some
 18482	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCouncells have decreed, and the Popes have decreed, and the Popes have
 18483	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\taccordingly, when the occasion hath served them, put in practise. For
 18484	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe fourth Councell of Lateran held under Pope Innocent the third, (in
 18485	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe third Chap. De Haereticis,) hath this Canon. "If a King at the
 18486	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPopes admonition, doe not purge his Kingdome of Haeretiques, and being
 18487	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tExcommunicate for the same, make not satisfaction within a year, his
 18488	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsubjects are absolved of their Obedience." And the practise hereof hath
 18489	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeen seen on divers occasions; as in the Deposing of Chilperique, King
 18490	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof France; in the Translation of the Roman Empire to Charlemaine; in
 18491	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Oppression of John King of England; in Transferring the Kingdome
 18492	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Navarre; and of late years, in the League against Henry the third of
 18493	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFrance, and in many more occurrences. I think there be few Princes that
 18494	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsider not this as Injust, and Inconvenient; but I wish they would
 18495	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall resolve to be Kings, or Subjects. Men cannot serve two Masters: They
 18496	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tought therefore to ease them, either by holding the Reins of Government
 18497	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twholly in their own hands; or by wholly delivering them into the
 18498	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thands of the Pope; that such men as are willing to be obedient, may be
 18499	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprotected in their obedience. For this distinction of Temporall, and
 18500	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSpirituall Power is but words. Power is as really divided, and as
 18501	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdangerously to all purposes, by sharing with another Indirect Power, as
 18502	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith a Direct one. But to come now to his Arguments.
 18503	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18504	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe first is this, "The Civill Power is subject to the Spirituall:
 18505	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTherefore he that hath the Supreme Power Spirituall, hath right to
 18506	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommand Temporall Princes, and dispose of their Temporalls in order to
 18507	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Spirituall. As for the distinction of Temporall, and Spirituall,
 18508	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlet us consider in what sense it may be said intelligibly, that the
 18509	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTemporall, or Civill Power is subject to the Spirituall. There be but
 18510	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttwo ways that those words can be made sense. For when wee say, one Power
 18511	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis subject to another Power, the meaning either is, that he which hath
 18512	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe one, is subject to him that hath the other; or that the one Power is
 18513	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto the other, as the means to the end. For wee cannot understand, that
 18514	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tone Power hath Power over another Power; and that one Power can have
 18515	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRight or Command over another: For Subjection, Command, Right, and
 18516	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPower are accidents, not of Powers, but of Persons: One Power may be
 18517	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsubordinate to another, as the art of a Sadler, to the art of a Rider.
 18518	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIf then it be granted, that the Civill Government be ordained as a means
 18519	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto bring us to a Spirituall felicity; yet it does not follow, that if a
 18520	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKing have the Civill Power, and the Pope the Spirituall, that therefore
 18521	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe King is bound to obey the Pope, more then every Sadler is bound to
 18522	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobey every Rider. Therefore as from Subordination of an Art, cannot be
 18523	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinferred the Subjection of the Professor; so from the Subordination of
 18524	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Government, cannot be inferred the Subjection of the Governor. When
 18525	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore he saith, the Civill Power is Subject to the Spirituall, his
 18526	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmeaning is, that the Civill Soveraign, is Subject to the Spirituall
 18527	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign. And the Argument stands thus, "The Civil Soveraign, is
 18528	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsubject to the Spirituall; Therefore the Spirituall Prince may
 18529	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommand Temporall Princes." Where the conclusion is the same, with the
 18530	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAntecedent he should have proved. But to prove it, he alledgeth
 18531	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfirst, this reason, "Kings and Popes, Clergy and Laity make but one
 18532	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth; that is to say, but one Church: And in all Bodies the
 18533	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMembers depend one upon another: But things Spirituall depend not
 18534	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof things Temporall: Therefore, Temporall depend on Spirituall. And
 18535	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore are Subject to them." In which Argumentation there be two
 18536	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgrosse errours: one is, that all Christian Kings, Popes, Clergy, and all
 18537	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother Christian men, make but one Common-wealth: For it is evident that
 18538	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFrance is one Common-wealth, Spain another, and Venice a third, &c. And
 18539	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthese consist of Christians; and therefore also are severall Bodies
 18540	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Christians; that is to say, severall Churches: And their severall
 18541	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraigns Represent them, whereby they are capable of commanding and
 18542	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobeying, of doing and suffering, as a natural man; which no Generall or
 18543	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tUniversall Church is, till it have a Representant; which it hath not on
 18544	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEarth: for if it had, there is no doubt but that all Christendome were
 18545	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tone Common-wealth, whose Soveraign were that Representant, both in
 18546	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthings Spirituall and Temporall: And the Pope, to make himself this
 18547	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRepresentant, wanteth three things that our Saviour hath not given
 18548	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim, to Command, and to Judge, and to Punish, otherwise than (by
 18549	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tExcommunication) to run from those that will not Learn of him: For
 18550	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthough the Pope were Christs onely Vicar, yet he cannot exercise his
 18551	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgovernment, till our Saviours second coming: And then also it is not the
 18552	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPope, but St. Peter himselfe, with the other Apostles, that are to be
 18553	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJudges of the world.
 18554	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18555	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe other errour in this his first Argument is, that he sayes, the
 18556	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMembers of every Common-wealth, as of a naturall Body, depend one of
 18557	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tanother: It is true, they cohaere together; but they depend onely on the
 18558	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign, which is the Soul of the Common-wealth; which failing, the
 18559	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth is dissolved into a Civill war, no one man so much
 18560	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas cohaering to another, for want of a common Dependance on a known
 18561	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign; Just as the Members of the naturall Body dissolve into Earth,
 18562	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor want of a Soul to hold them together. Therefore there is nothing in
 18563	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis similitude, from whence to inferre a dependance of the Laity on the
 18564	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tClergy, or of the Temporall Officers on the Spirituall; but of both on
 18565	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Civill Soveraign; which ought indeed to direct his Civill commands
 18566	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto the Salvation of Souls; but is not therefore subject to any but God
 18567	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thimselfe. And thus you see the laboured fallacy of the first Argument,
 18568	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto deceive such men as distinguish not between the Subordination of
 18569	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tActions in the way to the End; and the Subjection of Persons one to
 18570	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tanother in the administration of the Means. For to every End, the Means
 18571	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare determined by Nature, or by God himselfe supernaturally: but the
 18572	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPower to make men use the Means, is in every nation resigned (by the
 18573	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaw of Nature, which forbiddeth men to violate their Faith given) to the
 18574	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCivill Soveraign.
 18575	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18576	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHis second Argument is this, "Every Common-wealth, (because it is
 18577	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsupposed to be perfect and sufficient in it self,) may command any
 18578	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother Common-wealth, not subject to it, and force it to change the
 18579	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tadministration of the Government, nay depose the Prince, and set another
 18580	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin his room, if it cannot otherwise defend it selfe against the injuries
 18581	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the goes about to doe them: much more may a Spirituall Common-wealth
 18582	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommand a Temporall one to change the administration of their
 18583	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGovernment, and may depose Princes, and institute others, when they
 18584	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcannot otherwise defend the Spirituall Good."
 18585	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18586	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThat a Common-wealth, to defend it selfe against injuries, may lawfully
 18587	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdoe all that he hath here said, is very true; and hath already in that
 18588	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich hath gone before been sufficiently demonstrated. And if it were
 18589	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talso true, that there is now in this world a Spirituall Common-wealth,
 18590	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdistinct from a Civill Common-wealth, then might the Prince thereof,
 18591	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tupon injury done him, or upon want of caution that injury be not done
 18592	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim in time to come, repaire, and secure himself by Warre; which is in
 18593	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsumme, deposing, killing, or subduing, or doing any act of Hostility.
 18594	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut by the same reason, it would be no lesse lawfull for a Civill
 18595	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign, upon the like injuries done, or feared, to make warre
 18596	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tupon the Spirituall Soveraign; which I beleeve is more than Cardinall
 18597	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBellarmine would have inferred from his own proposition.
 18598	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18599	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut Spirituall Common-wealth there is none in this world: for it is the
 18600	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsame thing with the Kingdome of Christ; which he himselfe saith, is not
 18601	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof this world; but shall be in the next world, at the Resurrection, when
 18602	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey that have lived justly, and beleeved that he was the Christ, shall
 18603	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(though they died Naturall bodies) rise Spirituall bodies; and then it
 18604	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis, that our Saviour shall judge the world, and conquer his Adversaries,
 18605	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand make a Spirituall Common-wealth. In the mean time, seeing there are
 18606	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tno men on earth, whose bodies are Spirituall; there can be no Spirituall
 18607	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth amongst men that are yet in the flesh; unlesse wee call
 18608	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPreachers, that have Commission to Teach, and prepare men for
 18609	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir reception into the Kingdome of Christ at the Resurrection, a
 18610	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealth; which I have proved to bee none.
 18611	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18612	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe third Argument is this; "It is not lawfull for Christians to
 18613	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttolerate an Infidel, or Haereticall King, in case he endeavour to draw
 18614	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem to his Haeresie, or Infidelity. But to judge whether a King draw
 18615	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this subjects to Haeresie, or not, belongeth to the Pope. Therefore hath
 18616	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Pope Right, to determine whether the Prince be to be deposed, or not
 18617	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdeposed."
 18618	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18619	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo this I answer, that both these assertions are false. For Christians,
 18620	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(or men of what Religion soever,) if they tolerate not their King,
 18621	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhatsoever law hee maketh, though it bee concerning Religion, doe
 18622	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tviolate their faith, contrary to the Divine Law, both Naturall and
 18623	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPositive: Nor is there any Judge of Haeresie amongst Subjects, but
 18624	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir own Civill Soveraign; for "Haeresie is nothing else, but a private
 18625	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\topinion, obstinately maintained, contrary to the opinion which the
 18626	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPublique Person (that is to say, the Representant of the Common-wealth)
 18627	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thath commanded to bee taught." By which it is manifest, that an
 18628	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\topinion publiquely appointed to bee taught, cannot be Haeresie; nor the
 18629	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign Princes that authorize them, Haeretiques. For Haeretiques are
 18630	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnone but private men, that stubbornly defend some Doctrine, prohibited
 18631	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby their lawful Soveraigns.
 18632	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18633	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut to prove that Christians are not to tolerate Infidell, or
 18634	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHaereticall Kings, he alledgeth a place in Deut. 17. where God
 18635	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tforbiddeth the Jews, when they shall set a King over themselves, to
 18636	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tchoose a stranger; And from thence inferreth, that it is unlawfull for
 18637	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Christian, to choose a King, that is not a Christian. And 'tis true,
 18638	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat he that is a Christian, that is, hee that hath already obliged
 18639	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thimself to receive our Saviour when he shall come, for his King, shal
 18640	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttempt God too much in choosing for King in this world, one that hee
 18641	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tknoweth will endeavour, both by terrour, and perswasion to make him
 18642	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tviolate his faith. But, it is (saith hee) the same danger, to choose one
 18643	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat is not a Christian, for King, and not to depose him, when hee
 18644	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis chosen. To this I say, the question is not of the danger of not
 18645	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdeposing; but of the Justice of deposing him. To choose him, may in some
 18646	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcases bee unjust; but to depose him, when he is chosen, is in no case
 18647	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJust. For it is alwaies violation of faith, and consequently against the
 18648	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaw of Nature, which is the eternal Law of God. Nor doe wee read, that
 18649	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tany such Doctrine was accounted Christian in the time of the Apostles;
 18650	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnor in the time of the Romane Emperours, till the Popes had the Civill
 18651	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraignty of Rome. But to this he hath replyed, that the Christians of
 18652	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\told, deposed not Nero, nor Diocletian, nor Julian, nor Valens an Arrian,
 18653	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor this cause onely, that they wanted Temporall forces. Perhaps so. But
 18654	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdid our Saviour, who for calling for, might have had twelve Legions
 18655	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof immortall, invulnerable Angels to assist him, want forces to depose
 18656	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCaesar, or at least Pilate, that unjustly, without finding fault in him,
 18657	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdelivered him to the Jews to bee crucified? Or if the Apostles wanted
 18658	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTemporall forces to depose Nero, was it therefore necessary for them in
 18659	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir Epistles to the new made Christians, to teach them, (as they did)
 18660	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto obey the Powers constituted over them, (whereof Nero in that time was
 18661	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tone,) and that they ought to obey them, not for fear of their wrath,
 18662	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut for conscience sake? Shall we say they did not onely obey, but also
 18663	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tteach what they meant not, for want of strength? It is not therefore
 18664	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor want of strength, but for conscience sake, that Christians are to
 18665	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttolerate their Heathen Princes, or Princes (for I cannot call any one
 18666	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhose Doctrine is the Publique Doctrine, an Haeretique) that authorize
 18667	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe teaching of an Errour. And whereas for the Temporall Power of the
 18668	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPope, he alledgeth further, that St. Paul (1 Cor. 6.) appointed Judges
 18669	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunder the Heathen Princes of those times, such as were not ordained by
 18670	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose Princes; it is not true. For St. Paul does but advise them,
 18671	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto take some of their Brethren to compound their differences, as
 18672	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tArbitrators, rather than to goe to law one with another before the
 18673	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHeathen Judges; which is a wholsome Precept, and full of Charity, fit
 18674	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto bee practised also in the Best Christian Common-wealths. And for
 18675	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe danger that may arise to Religion, by the Subjects tolerating of an
 18676	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHeathen, or an Erring Prince, it is a point, of which a Subject is no
 18677	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcompetent Judge; or if hee bee, the Popes Temporall Subjects may judge
 18678	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talso of the Popes Doctrine. For every Christian Prince, as I have
 18679	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tformerly proved, is no lesse Supreme Pastor of his own Subjects, than
 18680	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Pope of his.
 18681	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18682	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe fourth Argument, is taken from the Baptisme of Kings; wherein, that
 18683	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey may be made Christians they submit their Scepters to Christ; and
 18684	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpromise to keep, and defend the Christian Faith. This is true; for
 18685	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChristian Kings are no more but Christs Subjects: but they may, for all
 18686	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat, bee the Popes Fellowes; for they are Supreme Pastors of their own
 18687	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSubjects; and the Pope is no more but King, and Pastor, even in Rome it
 18688	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tselfe.
 18689	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18690	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe fifth Argument, is drawn from the words spoken by our Saviour, Feed
 18691	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMy Sheep; by which was give all Power necessary for a Pastor; as the
 18692	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPower to chase away Wolves, such as are Haeretiques; the Power to shut
 18693	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tup Rammes, if they be mad, or push at the other Sheep with their Hornes,
 18694	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch as are Evill (though Christian) Kings; and Power to give the Flock
 18695	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconvenient food: From whence hee inferreth, that St. Peter had these
 18696	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthree Powers given him by Christ. To which I answer, that the last of
 18697	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthese Powers, is no more than the Power, or rather Command to Teach.
 18698	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor the first, which is to chase away Wolves, that is, Haeretiques, the
 18699	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tplace hee quoteth is (Matth. 7.15.) "Beware of false Prophets which
 18700	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcome to you in Sheeps clothing, but inwardly are ravening Wolves."
 18701	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut neither are Haeretiques false Prophets, or at all Prophets: nor
 18702	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(admitting Haeretiques for the Wolves there meant,) were the Apostles
 18703	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommanded to kill them, or if they were Kings, to depose them; but to
 18704	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeware of, fly, and avoid them: nor was it to St. Peter, nor to any of
 18705	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Apostles, but to the multitude of the Jews that followed him into
 18706	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe mountain, men for the most part not yet converted, that hee gave
 18707	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis Counsell, to Beware of false Prophets: which therefore if it
 18708	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconferre a Power of chasing away Kings, was given, not onely to private
 18709	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen; but to men that were not at all Christians. And as to the Power
 18710	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Separating, and Shutting up of furious Rammes, (by which hee meaneth
 18711	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChristian Kings that refuse to submit themselves to the Roman Pastor,)
 18712	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tour Saviour refused to take upon him that Power in this world himself,
 18713	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut advised to let the Corn and Tares grow up together till the day of
 18714	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJudgment: much lesse did hee give it to St. Peter, or can S. Peter give
 18715	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit to the Popes. St. Peter, and all other Pastors, are bidden to esteem
 18716	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose Christians that disobey the Church, that is, (that disobey the
 18717	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChristian Soveraigne) as Heathen men, and as Publicans. Seeing then men
 18718	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tchallenge to the Pope no authority over Heathen Princes, they ought to
 18719	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tchallenge none over those that are to bee esteemed as Heathen.
 18720	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18721	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut from the Power to Teach onely, hee inferreth also a Coercive Power
 18722	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the Pope, over Kings. The Pastor (saith he) must give his flock
 18723	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconvenient food: Therefore the Pope may, and ought to compell Kings to
 18724	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdoe their duty. Out of which it followeth, that the Pope, as Pastor of
 18725	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChristian men, is King of Kings: which all Christian Kings ought indeed
 18726	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teither to Confesse, or else they ought to take upon themselves the
 18727	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSupreme Pastorall Charge, every one in his own Dominion.
 18728	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18729	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHis sixth, and last Argument, is from Examples. To which I answer,
 18730	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfirst, that Examples prove nothing; Secondly, that the Examples he
 18731	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talledgeth make not so much as a probability of Right. The fact of
 18732	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJehoiada, in Killing Athaliah (2 Kings 11.) was either by the Authority
 18733	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof King Joash, or it was a horrible Crime in the High Priest, which
 18734	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(ever after the election of King Saul) was a mere Subject. The fact of
 18735	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSt. Ambrose, in Excommunicating Theodosius the Emperour, (if it were
 18736	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttrue hee did so,) was a Capitall Crime. And for the Popes, Gregory 1.
 18737	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGreg. 2. Zachary, and Leo 3. their Judgments are void, as given in their
 18738	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\town Cause; and the Acts done by them conformably to this Doctrine, are
 18739	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe greatest Crimes (especially that of Zachary) that are incident to
 18740	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHumane Nature. And thus much of Power Ecclesiasticall; wherein I had
 18741	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeen more briefe, forbearing to examine these Arguments of Bellarmine,
 18742	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tif they had been his, as a Private man, and not as the Champion of the
 18743	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPapacy, against all other Christian Princes, and States.

 18753	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Difficulty Of Obeying God And Man Both At Once
 18754	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18755	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe most frequent praetext of Sedition, and Civill Warre, in Christian
 18756	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealths hath a long time proceeded from a difficulty, not yet
 18757	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsufficiently resolved, of obeying at once, both God, and Man, then
 18758	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhen their Commandements are one contrary to the other. It is manifest
 18759	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tenough, that when a man receiveth two contrary Commands, and knows that
 18760	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tone of them is Gods, he ought to obey that, and not the other, though
 18761	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit be the command even of his lawfull Soveraign (whether a Monarch, or
 18762	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Soveraign Assembly,) or the command of his Father. The difficulty
 18763	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore consisteth in this, that men when they are commanded in the
 18764	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tname of God, know not in divers Cases, whether the command be from God,
 18765	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor whether he that commandeth, doe but abuse Gods name for some private
 18766	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tends of his own. For as there ware in the Church of the Jews, many false
 18767	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tProphets, that sought reputation with the people, by feigned Dreams, and
 18768	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tVisions; so there have been in all times in the Church of Christ, false
 18769	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTeachers, that seek reputation with the people, by phantasticall and
 18770	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfalse Doctrines; and by such reputation (as is the nature of Ambition,)
 18771	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto govern them for their private benefit.

 18783	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmoment. For if the command of the Civill Soveraign bee such, as that it
 18784	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmay be obeyed, without the forfeiture of life Eternall; not to obey it
 18785	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis unjust; and the precept of the Apostle takes place; "Servants obey
 18786	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tyour Masters in all things;" and, "Children obey your Parents in all
 18787	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthings;" and the precept of our Saviour, "The Scribes and Pharisees sit
 18788	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin Moses Chaire, All therefore they shall say, that observe, and doe."
 18789	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut if the command be such, as cannot be obeyed, without being damned
 18790	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto Eternall Death, then it were madnesse to obey it, and the Counsell
 18791	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof our Saviour takes place, (Mat. 10. 28.) "Fear not those that kill the
 18792	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbody, but cannot kill the soule." All men therefore that would avoid,
 18793	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tboth the punishments that are to be in this world inflicted, for
 18794	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdisobedience to their earthly Soveraign, and those that shall be
 18795	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinflicted in the world to come for disobedience to God, have need be
 18796	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttaught to distinguish well between what is, and what is not Necessary to
 18797	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEternall Salvation.

 18802	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAll That Is Necessary To Salvation Is Contained In Faith And Obedience
 18803	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18804	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAll that is NECESSARY to Salvation, is contained in two Vertues, Faith
 18805	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin Christ, and Obedience to Laws. The latter of these, if it were
 18806	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tperfect, were enough to us. But because wee are all guilty of
 18807	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdisobedience to Gods Law, not onely originally in Adam, but also
 18808	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tactually by our own transgressions, there is required at our hands now,
 18809	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot onely Obedience for the rest of our time, but also a Remission of
 18810	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsins for the time past; which Remission is the reward of our Faith
 18811	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin Christ. That nothing else is Necessarily required to Salvation, is
 18812	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmanifest from this, that the Kingdome of Heaven, is shut to none but
 18813	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto Sinners; that is to say, to the disobedient, or transgressors of the
 18814	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaw; nor to them, in case they Repent, and Beleeve all the Articles of
 18815	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChristian Faith, Necessary to Salvation.

 18820	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhat Obedience Is Necessary;
 18821	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18822	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Obedience required at our hands by God, that accepteth in all our
 18823	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tactions the Will for the Deed, is a serious Endeavour to Obey him;
 18824	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand is called also by all such names as signifie that Endeavour. And
 18825	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore Obedience, is sometimes called by the names of Charity, and
 18826	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLove, because they imply a Will to Obey; and our Saviour himself maketh
 18827	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tour Love to God, and to one another, a Fulfilling of the whole Law: and
 18828	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsometimes by the name of Righteousnesse; for Righteousnesse is but the
 18829	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twill to give to every one his owne, that is to say, the will to obey
 18830	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Laws: and sometimes by the name of Repentance; because to Repent,
 18831	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\timplyeth a turning away from sinne, which is the same, with the return
 18832	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the will to Obedience. Whosoever therefore unfeignedly desireth
 18833	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto fulfill the Commandements of God, or repenteth him truely of his
 18834	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttransgressions, or that loveth God with all his heart, and his neighbor
 18835	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas himself, hath all the Obedience Necessary to his Reception into the
 18836	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKingdome of God: For if God should require perfect Innocence, there
 18837	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcould no flesh be saved.

 18842	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd To What Laws
 18843	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18844	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut what Commandements are those that God hath given us? Are all
 18845	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose Laws which were given to the Jews by the hand of Moses, the
 18846	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommandements of God? If they bee, why are not Christians taught to obey
 18847	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem? If they be not, what others are so, besides the Law of Nature? For
 18848	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tour Saviour Christ hath not given us new Laws, but Counsell to observe
 18849	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose wee are subject to; that is to say, the Laws of Nature, and the
 18850	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaws of our severall Soveraigns: Nor did he make any new Law to the Jews
 18851	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin his Sermon on the Mount, but onely expounded the Laws of Moses, to
 18852	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich they were subject before. The Laws of God therefore are none
 18853	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut the Laws of Nature, whereof the principall is, that we should
 18854	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot violate our Faith, that is, a commandement to obey our Civill
 18855	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraigns, which wee constituted over us, by mutuall pact one with
 18856	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tanother. And this Law of God, that commandeth Obedience to the Law
 18857	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCivill, commandeth by consequence Obedience to all the Precepts of the
 18858	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBible, which (as I have proved in the precedent Chapter) is there onely
 18859	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaw, where the Civill Soveraign hath made it so; and in other places but
 18860	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCounsell; which a man at his own perill, may without injustice refuse to

 18866	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn The Faith Of A Christian, Who Is The Person Beleeved
 18867	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18868	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKnowing now what is the Obedience Necessary to Salvation, and to whom
 18869	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit is due; we are to consider next concerning Faith, whom, and why we
 18870	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeleeve; and what are the Articles, or Points necessarily to be beleeved
 18871	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby them that shall be saved. And first, for the Person whom we beleeve,
 18872	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbecause it is impossible to beleeve any Person, before we know what he
 18873	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsaith, it is necessary he be one that wee have heard speak. The Person
 18874	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore, whom Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses and the Prophets beleeved,
 18875	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas God himself, that spake unto them supernaturally: And the Person,
 18876	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhom the Apostles and Disciples that conversed with Christ beleeved, was
 18877	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tour Saviour himself. But of them, to whom neither God the Father, nor
 18878	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tour Saviour ever spake, it cannot be said, that the Person whom they
 18879	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeleeved, was God. They beleeved the Apostles, and after them the
 18880	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPastors and Doctors of the Church, that recommended to their faith the
 18881	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHistory of the Old and New Testament: so that the Faith of Christians
 18882	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tever since our Saviours time, hath had for foundation, first, the
 18883	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treputation of their Pastors, and afterward, the authority of those that
 18884	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmade the Old and New Testament to be received for the Rule of Faith;
 18885	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich none could do but Christian Soveraignes; who are therefore the
 18886	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSupreme Pastors, and the onely Persons, whom Christians now hear speak
 18887	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom God; except such as God speaketh to, in these days supernaturally.
 18888	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut because there be many false Prophets "gone out into the world,"
 18889	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother men are to examine such Spirits (as St. John advised us, 1
 18890	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEpistle, Chap. 4. ver.1.) "whether they be of God, or not." And
 18891	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore, seeing the Examination of Doctrines belongeth to the Supreme
 18892	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPastor, the Person which all they that have no speciall revelation are
 18893	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto beleeve, is (in every Common-wealth) the Supreme Pastor, that is to
 18894	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsay, the Civill Soveraigne.

 18898	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18899	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Causes Of Christian Faith
 18900	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18901	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe causes why men beleeve any Christian Doctrine, are various; For
 18902	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFaith is the gift of God; and he worketh it in each severall man, by
 18903	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch wayes, as it seemeth good unto himself. The most ordinary immediate
 18904	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcause of our beleef, concerning any point of Christian Faith, is, that
 18905	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twee beleeve the Bible to be the Word of God. But why wee beleeve the
 18906	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBible to be the Word of God, is much disputed, as all questions must
 18907	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tneeds bee, that are not well stated. For they make not the question
 18908	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto be, "Why we Beleeve it," but "How wee Know it;" as if Beleeving and
 18909	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKnowing were all one. And thence while one side ground their Knowledge
 18910	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tupon the Infallibility of the Church, and the other side, on the
 18911	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTestimony of the Private Spirit, neither side concludeth what it
 18912	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpretends. For how shall a man know the Infallibility of the Church, but
 18913	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby knowing first the Infallibility of the Scripture? Or how shall a man
 18914	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tknow his own Private spirit to be other than a beleef, grounded upon the
 18915	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAuthority, and Arguments of his Teachers; or upon a Presumption of his
 18916	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\town Gifts? Besides, there is nothing in the Scripture, from which can be
 18917	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinferred the Infallibility of the Church; much lesse, of any particular
 18918	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChurch; and least of all, the Infallibility of any particular man.
 18919	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18920	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18921	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18922	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18923	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFaith Comes By Hearing
 18924	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18925	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIt is manifest, therefore, that Christian men doe not know, but onely
 18926	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeleeve the Scripture to be the Word of God; and that the means of
 18927	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmaking them beleeve which God is pleased to afford men ordinarily, is
 18928	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\taccording to the way of Nature, that is to say, from their Teachers.
 18929	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIt is the Doctrine of St. Paul concerning Christian Faith in generall,
 18930	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(Rom. 10.17.) "Faith cometh by Hearing," that is, by Hearing our lawfull
 18931	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPastors. He saith also (ver. 14,15. of the same Chapter) "How shall
 18932	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey beleeve in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear
 18933	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twithout a Preacher? and how shall they Preach, except they be sent?"
 18934	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhereby it is evident, that the ordinary cause of beleeving that the
 18935	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tScriptures are the Word of God, is the same with the cause of the
 18936	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeleeving of all other Articles of our Faith, namely, the Hearing of
 18937	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose that are by the Law allowed and appointed to Teach us, as our
 18938	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tParents in their Houses, and our Pastors in the Churches: Which also
 18939	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis made more manifest by experience. For what other cause can there bee
 18940	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tassigned, why in Christian Common-wealths all men either beleeve, or
 18941	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tat least professe the Scripture to bee the Word of God, and in other
 18942	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealths scarce any; but that in Christian Common-wealths they
 18943	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare taught it from their infancy; and in other places they are taught
 18944	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\totherwise?
 18945	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18946	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut if Teaching be the cause of Faith, why doe not all beleeve? It is
 18947	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcertain therefore that Faith is the gift of God, and hee giveth it to
 18948	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhom he will. Neverthelesse, because of them to whom he giveth it, he
 18949	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgiveth it by the means of Teachers, the immediate cause of Faith is
 18950	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHearing. In a School where many are taught, and some profit, others
 18951	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprofit not, the cause of learning in them that profit, is the Master;
 18952	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tyet it cannot be thence inferred, that learning is not the gift of God.
 18953	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAll good things proceed from God; yet cannot all that have them, say
 18954	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey are Inspired; for that implies a gift supernaturall, and the
 18955	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\timmediate hand of God; which he that pretends to, pretends to be a
 18956	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tProphet, and is subject to the examination of the Church.
 18957	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18958	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut whether men Know, or Beleeve, or Grant the Scriptures to be the Word
 18959	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof God; if out of such places of them, as are without obscurity, I
 18960	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshall shew what Articles of Faith are necessary, and onely necessary for
 18961	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSalvation, those men must needs Know, Beleeve, or Grant the same.
 18962	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18963	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Onely Necessary Article Of Christian Faith, The (Unum Necessarium)
 18964	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOnely Article of Faith, which the Scripture maketh simply Necessary to
 18965	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSalvation, is this, that JESUS IS THE CHRIST. By the name of Christ, is
 18966	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunderstood the King, which God had before promised by the Prophets of
 18967	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Old Testament, to send into the world, to reign (over the Jews,
 18968	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand over such of other nations as should beleeve in him) under himself
 18969	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teternally; and to give them that eternall life, which was lost by the
 18970	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsin of Adam. Which when I have proved out of Scripture, I will further
 18971	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshew when, and in what sense some other Articles may bee also called
 18972	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNecessary.

 18977	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tProved From The Scope Of The Evangelists
 18978	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 18979	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor Proof that the Beleef of this Article, Jesus Is The Christ, is all
 18980	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Faith required to Salvation, my first Argument shall bee from the
 18981	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tScope of the Evangelists; which was by the description of the life of
 18982	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tour Saviour, to establish that one Article, Jesus Is The Christ. The
 18983	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsumme of St. Matthews Gospell is this, That Jesus was of the stock of
 18984	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDavid; Born of a Virgin; which are the Marks of the true Christ: That
 18985	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Magi came to worship him as King of the Jews: That Herod for the
 18986	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsame cause sought to kill him: That John Baptist proclaimed him: That
 18987	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the preached by himselfe, and his Apostles that he was that King; That
 18988	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the taught the Law, not as a Scribe, but as a man of Authority: That he
 18989	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcured diseases by his Word onely, and did many other Miracles, which
 18990	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere foretold the Christ should doe: That he was saluted King when he
 18991	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tentered into Jerusalem: That he fore-warned them to beware of all others
 18992	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat should pretend to be Christ: That he was taken, accused, and put
 18993	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto death, for saying, hee was King: That the cause of his condemnation
 18994	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twritten on the Crosse, was JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWES.
 18995	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAll which tend to no other end than this, that men should beleeve,
 18996	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat Jesus Is The Christ. Such therefore was the Scope of St. Matthews
 18997	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGospel. But the Scope of all the Evangelists (as may appear by reading
 18998	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem) was the same. Therefore the Scope of the whole Gospell, was the
 18999	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\testablishing of that onely Article. And St. John expressely makes it his
 19000	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconclusion, John 20. 31. "These things are written, that you may know
 19001	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God."

 19005	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19006	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFrom The Sermons Of The Apostles:
 19007	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19008	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMy second Argument is taken from the Subject of the Sermons of the
 19009	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tApostles, both whilest our Saviour lived on earth, and after his
 19010	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAscension. The Apostles in our Saviours time were sent, Luke 9.2. to
 19011	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPreach the Kingdome of God: For neither there, nor Mat. 10.7. giveth he
 19012	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tany Commission to them, other than this, "As ye go, Preach, saying, the
 19013	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKingdome of Heaven is at hand;" that is, that Jesus is the Messiah, the
 19014	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChrist, the King which was to come. That their Preaching also after his
 19015	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tascension was the same, is manifest out of Acts 17.6. "They drew (saith
 19016	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSt. Luke) Jason and certain Brethren unto the Rulers of the City,
 19017	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcrying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither
 19018	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talso, whom Jason hath received. And these all do contrary to the Decrees
 19019	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Caesar, saying, that there is another King, one Jesus:" And out of
 19020	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe 2.&3. verses of the same Chapter, where it is said, that St. Paul
 19021	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"as his manner was, went in unto them; and three Sabbath dayes reasoned
 19022	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith them out of the Scriptures; opening and alledging, that Christ must
 19023	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tneeds have suffered, and risen againe from the dead, and that this Jesus
 19024	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(whom he preached) is Christ."

 19029	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFrom The Easinesse Of The Doctrine:
 19030	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19031	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe third Argument is, from those places of Scripture, by which all the
 19032	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFaith required to Salvation is declared to be Easie. For if an inward
 19033	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tassent of the mind to all the Doctrines concerning Christian Faith now
 19034	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttaught, (whereof the greatest part are disputed,) were necessary to
 19035	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSalvation, there would be nothing in the world so hard, as to be a
 19036	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChristian. The Thief upon the Crosse though repenting, could not have
 19037	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeen saved for saying, "Lord remember me when thou commest into thy
 19038	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKingdome;" by which he testified no beleefe of any other Article, but
 19039	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis, That Jesus Was The King. Nor could it bee said (as it is Mat.
 19040	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t11. 30.) that "Christs yoke is Easy, and his burthen Light:" Nor that
 19041	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"Little Children beleeve in him," as it is Matth. 18.6. Nor could St.
 19042	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPaul have said (1 Cor. 1. 21.) "It pleased God by the Foolishnesse of
 19043	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpreaching, to save them that beleeve:" Nor could St. Paul himself have
 19044	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeen saved, much lesse have been so great a Doctor of the Church
 19045	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tso suddenly, that never perhaps thought of Transsubstantiation, nor
 19046	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPurgatory, nor many other Articles now obtruded.
 19047	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t

 19049	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19050	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19051	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFrom Formall And Cleer Texts
 19052	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19053	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe fourth Argument is taken from places expresse, and such as receive
 19054	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tno controversie of Interpretation; as first, John 5. 39. "Search the
 19055	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tScriptures, for in them yee thinke yee have eternall life; and they are
 19056	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey that testifie of mee." Our Saviour here speaketh of the Scriptures
 19057	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tonely of the Old Testament; for the Jews at that time could not search
 19058	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Scriptures of the New Testament, which were not written. But the Old
 19059	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTestament hath nothing of Christ, but the Markes by which men might
 19060	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tknow him when hee came; as that he should descend from David, be born at
 19061	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBethlehem, and of a Virgin; doe great Miracles, and the like. Therefore
 19062	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto beleeve that this Jesus was He, was sufficient to eternall life: but
 19063	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmore than sufficient is not Necessary; and consequently no other Article
 19064	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis required. Again, (John 11. 26.) "Whosoever liveth and beleeveth in
 19065	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmee, shall not die eternally," Therefore to beleeve in Christ, is faith
 19066	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsufficient to eternall life; and consequently no more faith than that
 19067	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis Necessary, But to beleeve in Jesus, and to beleeve that Jesus is the
 19068	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChrist, is all one, as appeareth in the verses immediately following.
 19069	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor when our Saviour (verse 26.) had said to Martha, "Beleevest thou
 19070	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis?" she answereth (verse 27.) "Yea Lord, I beleeve that thou art the
 19071	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChrist, the Son of God, which should come into the world;" Therefore
 19072	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis Article alone is faith sufficient to life eternall; and more than
 19073	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsufficient is not Necessary. Thirdly, John 20. 31. "These things are
 19074	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twritten that yee might beleeve, that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of
 19075	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod, and that beleeving yee might have life through his name." There, to
 19076	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeleeve that Jesus Is The Christ, is faith sufficient to the obtaining
 19077	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof life; and therefore no other Article is Necessary. Fourthly, 1 John
 19078	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t4. 2. "Every Spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the
 19079	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tflesh, is of God." And 1 Joh. 5. 1. "whosoever beleeveth that Jesus is
 19080	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Christ, is born of God." And verse 5. "Who is hee that overcommeth
 19081	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe world, but he that beleeveth that Jesus is the Son of God?" Fiftly,
 19082	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAct. 8. ver. 36, 37. "See (saith the Eunuch) here is water, what doth
 19083	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thinder me to be baptized? And Philip said, If thou beleevest with all
 19084	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthy heart thou mayst. And hee answered and said, I beleeve that Jesus
 19085	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChrist is the Son of God." Therefore this Article beleeved, Jesus Is The
 19086	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChrist, is sufficient to Baptisme, that is to say, to our Reception into
 19087	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Kingdome of God, and by consequence, onely Necessary. And generally
 19088	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin all places where our Saviour saith to any man, "Thy faith hath saved
 19089	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthee," the cause he saith it, is some Confession, which directly, or by
 19090	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsequence, implyeth a beleef, that Jesus Is The Christ.
 19091	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19092	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19093	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19094	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19095	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFrom That It Is The Foundation Of All Other Articles
 19096	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19097	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe last Argument is from the places, where this Article is made the
 19098	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFoundation of Faith: For he that holdeth the Foundation shall bee saved.
 19099	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhich places are first, Mat. 24.23. "If any man shall say unto you, Loe,
 19100	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\there is Christ, or there, beleeve it not, for there shall arise false
 19101	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChrists, and false Prophets, and shall shew great signes and wonders,
 19102	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t&c." Here wee see, this Article Jesus Is The Christ, must bee held,
 19103	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthough hee that shall teach the contrary should doe great miracles. The
 19104	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsecond place is Gal. 1. 8. "Though we, or an Angell from Heaven preach
 19105	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tany other Gospell unto you, than that wee have preached unto you, let
 19106	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim bee accursed." But the Gospell which Paul, and the other Apostles,
 19107	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpreached, was onely this Article, that Jesus Is The Christ; Therefore
 19108	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor the Beleef of this Article, we are to reject the Authority of
 19109	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tan Angell from heaven; much more of any mortall man, if he teach the
 19110	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontrary. This is therefore the Fundamentall Article of Christian Faith.
 19111	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tA third place is, 1 Joh. 4.1. "Beloved, beleeve not every spirit. Hereby
 19112	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tyee shall know the Spirit of God; every spirit that confesseth that
 19113	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJesus Christ is come in the flesh, is of God." By which it is evident,
 19114	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat this Article, is the measure, and rule, by which to estimate,
 19115	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand examine all other Articles; and is therefore onely Fundamentall.
 19116	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tA fourth is, Matt. 16.18. where after St. Peter had professed this
 19117	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tArticle, saying to our Saviour, "Thou art Christ the Son of the living
 19118	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod," Our Saviour answered, "Thou art Peter, and upon this Rock I will
 19119	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbuild my Church:" from whence I inferre, that this Article is that,
 19120	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ton which all other Doctrines of the Church are built, as on their
 19121	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFoundation. A fift is (1 Cor. 3. ver. 11, 12, &c.) "Other Foundation can
 19122	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tno man lay, than that which is laid, Jesus is the Christ. Now if any man
 19123	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbuild upon this Foundation, Gold, Silver, pretious Stones, Wood, Hay,
 19124	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tStubble; Every mans work shall be made manifest; For the Day shall
 19125	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdeclare it, because it shall be revealed by fire, and the fire shall try
 19126	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevery mans work, of what sort it is. If any mans work abide, which he
 19127	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward: If any mans work shall
 19128	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbee burnt, he shall suffer losse; but he himself shall be saved, yet so
 19129	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas by fire." Which words, being partly plain and easie to understand,
 19130	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand partly allegoricall and difficult; out of that which is plain, may
 19131	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe inferred, that Pastors that teach this Foundation, that Jesus Is The
 19132	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChrist, though they draw from it false consequences, (which all men are
 19133	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsometimes subject to,) they may neverthelesse bee saved; much more that
 19134	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey may bee saved, who being no Pastors, but Hearers, beleeve that
 19135	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich is by their lawfull Pastors taught them. Therefore the beleef of
 19136	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis Article is sufficient; and by consequence there is no other Article
 19137	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Faith Necessarily required to Salvation.
 19138	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19139	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNow for the part which is Allegoricall, as "That the fire shall try
 19140	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevery mans work," and that "They shall be saved, but so as by fire,"
 19141	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor "through fire," (for the originall is dia puros,) it maketh nothing
 19142	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagainst this conclusion which I have drawn from the other words, that
 19143	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare plain. Neverthelesse, because upon this place there hath been an
 19144	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\targument taken, to prove the fire of Purgatory, I will also here offer
 19145	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tyou my conjecture concerning the meaning of this triall of Doctrines,
 19146	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand saving of men as by Fire. The Apostle here seemeth to allude to
 19147	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe words of the Prophet Zachary, Ch. 13. 8,9. who speaking of the
 19148	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRestauration of the Kingdome of God, saith thus, "Two parts therein
 19149	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshall be cut off, and die, but the third shall be left therein; and
 19150	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tI will bring the third part through the Fire, and will refine them as
 19151	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSilver is refined, and will try them as Gold is tryed; they shall call
 19152	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ton the name of the Lord, and I will hear them." The day of Judgment, is
 19153	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe day of the Restauration of the Kingdome of God; and at that day
 19154	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit is, that St. Peter tells us (2 Pet. 3. v.7, 10, 12.) shall be the
 19155	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConflagration of the world, wherein the wicked shall perish; but the
 19156	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tremnant which God will save, shall passe through that Fire, unhurt,
 19157	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand be therein (as Silver and Gold are refined by the fire from their
 19158	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdrosse) tryed, and refined from their Idolatry, and be made to call upon
 19159	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe name of the true God. Alluding whereto St. Paul here saith, that The
 19160	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDay (that is, the Day of Judgment, the Great Day of our Saviours comming
 19161	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto restore the Kingdome of God in Israel) shall try every mans doctrine,
 19162	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby Judging, which are Gold, Silver, Pretious Stones, Wood, Hay, Stubble;
 19163	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd then they that have built false Consequences on the true Foundation,
 19164	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshall see their Doctrines condemned; neverthelesse they themselves
 19165	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshall be saved, and passe unhurt through this universall Fire, and live
 19166	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teternally, to call upon the name of the true and onely God. In which
 19167	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsense there is nothing that accordeth not with the rest of Holy
 19168	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tScripture, or any glimpse of the fire of Purgatory.
 19169	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19170	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19171	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19172	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19173	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn What Sense Other Articles May Be Called Necessary
 19174	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19175	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut a man may here aske, whether it bee not as necessary to Salvation,
 19176	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto beleeve, that God is Omnipotent; Creator of the world; that Jesus
 19177	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChrist is risen; and that all men else shall rise again from the dead
 19178	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tat the last day; as to beleeve, that Jesus Is The Christ. To which I
 19179	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tanswer, they are; and so are many more Articles: but they are such, as
 19180	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare contained in this one, and may be deduced from it, with more, or
 19181	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlesse difficulty. For who is there that does not see, that they
 19182	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twho beleeve Jesus to be the Son of the God of Israel, and that the
 19183	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIsraelites had for God the Omnipotent Creator of all things, doe therein
 19184	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talso beleeve, that God is the Omnipotent Creator of all things? Or how
 19185	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcan a man beleeve, that Jesus is the King that shall reign eternally,
 19186	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunlesse hee beleeve him also risen again from the dead? For a dead man
 19187	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcannot exercise the Office of a King. In summe, he that holdeth this
 19188	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFoundation, Jesus Is The Christ, holdeth Expressely all that hee
 19189	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tseeth rightly deduced from it, and Implicitely all that is consequent
 19190	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthereunto, though he have not skill enough to discern the consequence.
 19191	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd therefore it holdeth still good, that the beleef of this one Article
 19192	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis sufficient faith to obtaine remission of sinnes to the Penitent, and
 19193	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsequently to bring them into the Kingdome of Heaven.
 19194	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19195	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19196	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19197	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19198	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThat Faith, And Obedience Are Both Of Them Necessary To Salvation
 19199	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19200	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNow that I have shewn, that all the Obedience required to Salvation,
 19201	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsisteth in the will to obey the Law of God, that is to say, in
 19202	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRepentance; and all the Faith required to the same, is comprehended in
 19203	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe beleef of this Article, Jesus Is The Christ; I will further alledge
 19204	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose places of the Gospell, that prove, that all that is Necessary to
 19205	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSalvation is contained in both these joined together. The men to whom
 19206	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSt. Peter preached on the day of Pentecost, next after the Ascension
 19207	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof our Saviour, asked him, and the rest of the Apostles, saying, (Act.
 19208	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t2.37.) "Men and Brethren what shall we doe?" to whom St. Peter answered
 19209	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(in the next verse) "Repent, and be Baptized every one of you, for the
 19210	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tremission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost."
 19211	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTherefore Repentance, and Baptisme, that is, beleeving that Jesus Is The
 19212	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChrist, is all that is Necessary to Salvation. Again, our Saviour being
 19213	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tasked by a certain Ruler, (Luke 18.18.) "What shall I doe to inherit
 19214	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teternall life?" Answered (verse 20) "Thou knowest the Commandements,
 19215	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDoe not commit Adultery, Doe not Kill, Doe not Steal, Doe not bear false
 19216	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twitnesse, Honor thy Father, and thy Mother;" which when he said he had
 19217	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobserved, our Saviour added, "Sell all thou hast, give it to the Poor,
 19218	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand come and follow me:" which was as much as to say, Relye on me that
 19219	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tam the King: Therefore to fulfill the Law, and to beleeve that Jesus
 19220	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis the King, is all that is required to bring a man to eternall life.
 19221	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThirdly, St. Paul saith (Rom. 1.17.) "The Just shall live by Faith;" not
 19222	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevery one, but the Just; therefore Faith and Justice (that is, the Will
 19223	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo Be Just, or Repentance) are all that is Necessary to life eternall.
 19224	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd (Mark 1.15.) our Saviour preached, saying, "The time is fulfilled,
 19225	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand the Kingdom of God is at hand, Repent and Beleeve the Evangile,"
 19226	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat is, the Good news that the Christ was come. Therefore to Repent,
 19227	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand to Beleeve that Jesus is the Christ, is all that is required to
 19228	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSalvation.
 19229	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19230	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19231	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19232	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19233	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhat Each Of Them Contributes Thereunto
 19234	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19235	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSeeing then it is Necessary that Faith, and Obedience (implyed in the
 19236	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tword Repentance) do both concurre to our Salvation; the question
 19237	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby which of the two we are Justified, is impertinently disputed.
 19238	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNeverthelesse, it will not be impertinent, to make manifest in what
 19239	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmanner each of them contributes thereunto; and in what sense it is said,
 19240	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat we are to be Justified by the one, and by the other. And first,
 19241	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tif by Righteousnesse be understood the Justice of the Works themselves,
 19242	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere is no man that can be saved; for there is none that hath not
 19243	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttransgressed the Law of God. And therefore when wee are said to be
 19244	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJustified by Works, it is to be understood of the Will, which God doth
 19245	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talwaies accept for the Work it selfe, as well in good, as in evill men.
 19246	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd in this sense onely it is, that a man is called Just, or Unjust; and
 19247	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat his Justice Justifies him, that is, gives him the title, in Gods
 19248	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tacceptation, of Just; and renders him capable of Living By His Faith,
 19249	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich before he was not. So that Justice Justifies in that that sense,
 19250	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin which to Justifie, is the same that to Denominate A Man Just; and not
 19251	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the signification of discharging the Law; whereby the punishment of
 19252	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this sins should be unjust.
 19253	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19254	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut a man is then also said to be Justified, when his Plea, though in
 19255	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit selfe unsufficient, is accepted; as when we Plead our Will, our
 19256	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEndeavour to fulfill the Law, and Repent us of our failings, and God
 19257	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\taccepteth it for the Performance it selfe: And because God accepteth not
 19258	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Will for the Deed, but onely in the Faithfull; it is therefore Faith
 19259	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat makes good our Plea; and in this sense it is, that Faith onely
 19260	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJustifies: So that Faith and Obedience are both Necessary to Salvation;
 19261	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tyet in severall senses each of them is said to Justifie.
 19262	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19263	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19264	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19265	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19266	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tObedience To God And To The Civill Soveraign Not Inconsistent
 19267	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19268	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhether Christian, Having thus shewn what is Necessary to Salvation; it
 19269	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis not hard to reconcile our Obedience to the Civill Soveraign; who is
 19270	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teither Christian, or Infidel. If he bee a Christian, he alloweth the

 19272	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tArticles that are contained in, or are evident consequence deduced from
 19273	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit: which is all the Faith Necessary to Salvation. And because he is a
 19274	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign, he requireth Obedience to all his owne, that is, to all the
 19275	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCivill Laws; in which also are contained all the Laws of Nature, that
 19276	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis, all the Laws of God: for besides the Laws of Nature, and the Laws of
 19277	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Church, which are part of the Civill Law, (for the Church that
 19278	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcan make Laws is the Common-wealth,) there bee no other Laws Divine.
 19279	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhosoever therefore obeyeth his Christian Soveraign, is not thereby
 19280	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thindred, neither from beleeving, nor from obeying God. But suppose that
 19281	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Christian King should from this Foundation, Jesus Is The Christ, draw
 19282	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsome false consequences, that is to say, make some superstructions of
 19283	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHay, or Stubble, and command the teaching of the same; yet seeing St.
 19284	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPaul says, he shal be saved; much more shall he be saved, that teacheth
 19285	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem by his command; and much more yet, he that teaches not, but onely
 19286	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeleeves his lawfull Teacher. And in case a Subject be forbidden by
 19287	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Civill Soveraign to professe some of those his opinions, upon
 19288	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhat grounds can he disobey? Christian Kings may erre in deducing a
 19289	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConsequence, but who shall Judge? Shall a private man Judge, when the
 19290	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tquestion is of his own obedience? or shall any man Judg but he that is
 19291	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tappointed thereto by the Church, that is, by the Civill Soveraign that
 19292	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trepresenteth it? or if the Pope, or an Apostle Judge, may he not erre
 19293	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin deducing of a consequence? did not one of the two, St. Peter, or St.
 19294	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPaul erre in a superstructure, when St. Paul withstood St. Peter to his
 19295	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tface? There can therefore be no contradiction between the Laws of God,
 19296	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand the Laws of a Christian Common-wealth.

 19302	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19303	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd when the Civill Soveraign is an Infidel, every one of his own
 19304	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSubjects that resisteth him, sinneth against the Laws of God (for such
 19305	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas are the Laws of Nature,) and rejecteth the counsell of the Apostles,
 19306	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat admonisheth all Christians to obey their Princes, and all Children
 19307	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Servants to obey they Parents, and Masters, in all things. And for
 19308	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir Faith, it is internall, and invisible; They have the licence that
 19309	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNaaman had, and need not put themselves into danger for it. But if they
 19310	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdo, they ought to expect their reward in Heaven, and not complain of
 19311	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir Lawfull Soveraign; much lesse make warre upon him. For he that
 19312	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis not glad of any just occasion of Martyrdome, has not the faith be
 19313	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprofesseth, but pretends it onely, to set some colour upon his own
 19314	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontumacy. But what Infidel King is so unreasonable, as knowing he has
 19315	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Subject, that waiteth for the second comming of Christ, after the
 19316	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpresent world shall be burnt, and intendeth then to obey him (which is
 19317	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe intent of beleeving that Jesus is the Christ,) and in the mean time
 19318	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthinketh himself bound to obey the Laws of that Infidel King, (which
 19319	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall Christians are obliged in conscience to doe,) to put to death, or to
 19320	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpersecute such a Subject?
 19321	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19322	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd thus much shall suffice, concerning the Kingdome of God, and Policy
 19323	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEcclesiasticall. Wherein I pretend not to advance any Position of
 19324	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmy own, but onely to shew what are the Consequences that seem to me
 19325	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdeducible from the Principles of Christian Politiques, (which are the
 19326	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tholy Scriptures,) in confirmation of the Power of Civill Soveraigns, and
 19327	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Duty of their Subjects. And in the allegation of Scripture, I have
 19328	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tendeavoured to avoid such Texts as are of obscure, or controverted
 19329	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInterpretation; and to alledge none, but is such sense as is most plain,
 19330	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand agreeable to the harmony and scope of the whole Bible; which was
 19331	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twritten for the re-establishment of the Kingdome of God in Christ. For
 19332	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit is not the bare Words, but the Scope of the writer that giveth the
 19333	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttrue light, by which any writing is to bee interpreted; and they that
 19334	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinsist upon single Texts, without considering the main Designe, can
 19335	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tderive no thing from them cleerly; but rather by casting atomes of
 19336	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tScripture, as dust before mens eyes, make every thing more obscure than
 19337	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit is; an ordinary artifice of those that seek not the truth, but their

 19349	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19350	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBesides these Soveraign Powers, Divine, and Humane, of which I have
 19351	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thitherto discoursed, there is mention in Scripture of another Power,
 19352	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnamely, (Eph. 6. 12.), that of "the Rulers of the Darknesse of this
 19353	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tworld," (Mat. 12. 26.), "the Kingdome of Satan," and, (Mat. 9. 34.), "the
 19354	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPrincipality of Beelzebub over Daemons," that is to say, over Phantasmes
 19355	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat appear in the Air: For which cause Satan is also called (Eph. 2.
 19356	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t2.) "the Prince of the Power of the Air;" and (because he ruleth in the
 19357	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdarknesse of this world) (Joh. 16. 11.) "The Prince of this world;" And
 19358	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin consequence hereunto, they who are under his Dominion, in opposition
 19359	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto the faithfull (who are the Children Of The Light) are called the
 19360	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChildren Of Darknesse. For seeing Beelzebub is Prince of Phantasmes,
 19361	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInhabitants of his Dominion of Air and Darknesse, the Children of
 19362	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDarknesse, and these Daemons, Phantasmes, or Spirits of Illusion,
 19363	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsignifie allegorically the same thing. This considered, the Kingdome
 19364	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Darknesse, as it is set forth in these, and other places of the
 19365	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tScripture, is nothing else but a "Confederacy of Deceivers, that to
 19366	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobtain dominion over men in this present world, endeavour by dark, and
 19367	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\terroneous Doctrines, to extinguish in them the Light, both of Nature,
 19368	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand of the Gospell; and so to dis-prepare them for the Kingdome of God

 19374	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Church Not Yet Fully Freed Of Darknesse
 19375	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19376	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAs men that are utterly deprived from their Nativity, of the light
 19377	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the bodily Eye, have no Idea at all, of any such light; and no man
 19378	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconceives in his imagination any greater light, than he hath at some
 19379	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttime, or other perceived by his outward Senses: so also is it of the
 19380	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlight of the Gospel, and of the light of the Understanding, that no man
 19381	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcan conceive there is any greater degree of it, than that which he hath
 19382	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talready attained unto. And from hence it comes to passe, that men
 19383	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave no other means to acknowledge their owne Darknesse, but onely by
 19384	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treasoning from the un-forseen mischances, that befall them in their
 19385	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tways; The Darkest part of the Kingdome of Satan, is that which is
 19386	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twithout the Church of God; that is to say, amongst them that beleeve not
 19387	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin Jesus Christ. But we cannot say, that therefore the Church enjoyeth
 19388	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(as the land of Goshen) all the light, which to the performance of
 19389	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe work enjoined us by God, is necessary. Whence comes it, that in
 19390	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChristendome there has been, almost from the time of the Apostles,
 19391	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch justling of one another out of their places, both by forraign,
 19392	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Civill war? such stumbling at every little asperity of their own
 19393	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfortune, and every little eminence of that of other men? and such
 19394	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdiversity of ways in running to the same mark, Felicity, if it be not
 19395	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNight amongst us, or at least a Mist? wee are therefore yet in the Dark.

 19400	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFour Causes Of Spirituall Darknesse
 19401	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19402	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Enemy has been here in the Night of our naturall Ignorance, and sown
 19403	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe tares of Spirituall Errors; and that, First, by abusing, and
 19404	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tputting out the light of the Scriptures: For we erre, not knowing the
 19405	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tScriptures. Secondly, by introducing the Daemonology of the Heathen
 19406	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPoets, that is to say, their fabulous Doctrine concerning Daemons, which
 19407	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare but Idols, or Phantasms of the braine, without any reall nature of
 19408	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir own, distinct from humane fancy; such as are dead mens Ghosts, and
 19409	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFairies, and other matter of old Wives tales. Thirdly, by mixing with
 19410	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Scripture divers reliques of the Religion, and much of the vain and
 19411	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\terroneous Philosophy of the Greeks, especially of Aristotle. Fourthly,
 19412	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby mingling with both these, false, or uncertain Traditions, and
 19413	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfained, or uncertain History. And so we come to erre, by "giving heed
 19414	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto seducing Spirits," and the Daemonology of such "as speak lies in
 19415	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHypocrisie," (or as it is in the Originall, 1 Tim. 4.1,2. "of those that
 19416	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tplay the part of lyars") "with a seared conscience," that is, contrary
 19417	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto their own knowledge. Concerning the first of these, which is the
 19418	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSeducing of men by abuse of Scripture, I intend to speak briefly in this
 19419	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChapter.

 19427	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19428	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe greatest, and main abuse of Scripture, and to which almost all the
 19429	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trest are either consequent, or subservient, is the wresting of it, to
 19430	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprove that the Kingdome of God, mentioned so often in the Scripture, is
 19431	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe present Church, or multitude of Christian men now living, or that
 19432	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeing dead, are to rise again at the last day: whereas the Kingdome of
 19433	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod was first instituted by the Ministery of Moses, over the Jews onely;
 19434	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twho were therefore called his Peculiar People; and ceased afterward, in
 19435	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe election of Saul, when they refused to be governed by God any more,
 19436	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand demanded a King after the manner of the nations; which God himself
 19437	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsented unto, as I have more at large proved before, in the 35.
 19438	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChapter. After that time, there was no other Kingdome of God in the
 19439	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tworld, by any Pact, or otherwise, than he ever was, is, and shall be
 19440	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKing, of all men, and of all creatures, as governing according to his
 19441	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWill, by his infinite Power. Neverthelesse, he promised by his Prophets
 19442	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto restore this his Government to them again, when the time he hath in
 19443	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this secret counsell appointed for it shall bee fully come, and when they
 19444	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshall turn unto him by repentance, and amendment of life; and not
 19445	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tonely so, but he invited also the Gentiles to come in, and enjoy the
 19446	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thappinesse of his Reign, on the same conditions of conversion and
 19447	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trepentance; and hee promised also to send his Son into the world, to
 19448	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texpiate the sins of them all by his death, and to prepare them by his
 19449	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDoctrine, to receive him at his second coming: Which second coming not
 19450	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tyet being, the Kingdome of God is not yet come, and wee are not now
 19451	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunder any other Kings by Pact, but our Civill Soveraigns; saving onely,
 19452	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat Christian men are already in the Kingdome of Grace, in as much as
 19453	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey have already the Promise of being received at his comming againe.

 19460	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConsequent to this Errour, that the present Church is Christs Kingdome,
 19461	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere ought to be some one Man, or Assembly, by whose mouth our Saviour

 19463	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto all Christians, or divers Men, or divers Assemblies that doe the same
 19464	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto divers parts of Christendome. This power Regal under Christ, being
 19465	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tchallenged, universally by that Pope, and in particular Common-wealths
 19466	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby Assemblies of the Pastors of the place, (when the Scripture gives it
 19467	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto none but to Civill Soveraigns,) comes to be so passionately disputed,
 19468	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat it putteth out the Light of Nature, and causeth so great a

 19476	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19477	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConsequent to this claim of the Pope to Vicar Generall of Christ in the
 19478	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpresent Church, (supposed to be that Kingdom of his, to which we are
 19479	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\taddressed in the Gospel,) is the Doctrine, that it is necessary for a
 19480	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChristian King, to receive his Crown by a Bishop; as if it were from
 19481	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat Ceremony, that he derives the clause of Dei Gratia in his title;
 19482	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand that then onely he is made King by the favour of God, when he is
 19483	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcrowned by the authority of Gods universall Viceregent on earth; and
 19484	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat every Bishop whosoever be his Soveraign, taketh at his Consecration
 19485	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tan oath of absolute Obedience to the Pope, Consequent to the same, is
 19486	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Doctrine of the fourth Councell of Lateran, held under Pope Innocent
 19487	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe third, (Chap. 3. De Haereticis.) "That if a King at the Popes
 19488	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tadmonition, doe not purge his Kingdome of Haeresies, and being
 19489	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texcommunicate for the same, doe not give satisfaction within a year,
 19490	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this Subjects are absolved of the bond of their obedience." Where, by
 19491	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHaeresies are understood all opinions which the Church of Rome hath
 19492	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tforbidden to be maintained. And by this means, as often as there is
 19493	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tany repugnancy between the Politicall designes of the Pope, and other
 19494	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChristian Princes, as there is very often, there ariseth such a Mist
 19495	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tamongst their Subjects, that they know not a stranger that thrusteth
 19496	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thimself into the throne of their lawfull Prince, from him whom they
 19497	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thad themselves placed there; and in this Darknesse of mind, are made to
 19498	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfight one against another, without discerning their enemies from their

 19505	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19506	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFrom the same opinion, that the present Church is the Kingdome of God,
 19507	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit proceeds that Pastours, Deacons, and all other Ministers of the
 19508	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChurch, take the name to themselves of the Clergy, giving to other
 19509	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChristians the name of Laity, that is, simply People. For Clergy
 19510	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsignifies those, whose maintenance is that Revenue, which God having
 19511	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treserved to himselfe during his Reigne over the Israelites, assigned
 19512	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto the tribe of Levi (who were to be his publique Ministers, and had no
 19513	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tportion of land set them out to live on, as their brethren) to be their
 19514	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinheritance. The Pope therefore, (pretending the present Church to be,
 19515	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas the Realme of Israel, the Kingdome of God) challenging to himselfe
 19516	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand his subordinate Ministers, the like revenue, as the Inheritance of
 19517	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod, the name of Clergy was sutable to that claime. And thence it is,
 19518	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat Tithes, or other tributes paid to the Levites, as Gods Right,
 19519	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tamongst the Israelites, have a long time been demanded, and taken of
 19520	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChristians, by Ecclesiastiques, Jure Divino, that is, in Gods Right. By
 19521	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich meanes, the people every where were obliged to a double tribute;
 19522	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tone to the State, another to the Clergy; whereof, that to the Clergy,
 19523	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeing the tenth of their revenue, is double to that which a King of
 19524	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAthens (and esteemed a Tyrant) exacted of his subjects for the defraying
 19525	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof all publique charges: For he demanded no more but the twentieth part;
 19526	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand yet abundantly maintained therewith the Commonwealth. And in the
 19527	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKingdome of the Jewes, during the Sacerdotall Reigne of God, the Tithes
 19528	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Offerings were the whole Publique Revenue.
 19529	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19530	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFrom the same mistaking of the present Church for the Kingdom of God,
 19531	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcame in the distinction betweene the Civill and the Canon Laws: The
 19532	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcivil Law being the acts of Soveraigns in their own Dominions, and
 19533	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Canon Law being the Acts of the Pope in the same Dominions. Which
 19534	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCanons, though they were but Canons, that is, Rules Propounded, and but
 19535	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tvoluntarily received by Christian Princes, till the translation of
 19536	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Empire to Charlemain; yet afterwards, as the power of the Pope
 19537	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tencreased, became Rules Commanded, and the Emperours themselves (to
 19538	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tavoyd greater mischiefes, which the people blinded might be led into)
 19539	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere forced to let them passe for Laws.
 19540	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19541	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFrom hence it is, that in all Dominions, where the Popes Ecclesiasticall
 19542	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpower is entirely received, Jewes, Turkes, and Gentiles, are in the
 19543	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRoman Church tolerated in their Religion, as farre forth, as in the
 19544	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texercise and profession thereof they offend not against the civill
 19545	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpower: whereas in a Christian, though a stranger, not to be of the Roman
 19546	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tReligion, is Capitall; because the Pope pretendeth that all Christians
 19547	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare his Subjects. For otherwise it were as much against the law of
 19548	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNations, to persecute a Christian stranger, for professing the Religion
 19549	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof his owne country, as an Infidell; or rather more, in as much as they
 19550	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat are not against Christ, are with him.
 19551	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19552	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFrom the same it is, that in every Christian State there are certaine
 19553	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen, that are exempt, by Ecclesiasticall liberty, from the tributes, and
 19554	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom the tribunals of the Civil State; for so are the secular Clergy,
 19555	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbesides Monks and Friars, which in many places, bear so great a
 19556	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tproportion to the common people, as if need were, there might be raised
 19557	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tout of them alone, an Army, sufficient for any warre the Church militant
 19558	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshould imploy them in, against their owne, or other Princes.

 19563	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tError From Mistaking Consecration For Conjuration
 19564	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19565	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tA second generall abuse of Scripture, is the turning of Consecration
 19566	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinto Conjuration, or Enchantment. To Consecrate, is in Scripture, to
 19567	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOffer, Give, or Dedicate, in pious and decent language and gesture, a
 19568	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman, or any other thing to God, by separating of it from common use;
 19569	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat is to say, to Sanctifie, or make it Gods, and to be used only by
 19570	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose, whom God hath appointed to be his Publike Ministers, (as I have
 19571	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talready proved at large in the 35. Chapter;) and thereby to change, not
 19572	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe thing Consecrated, but onely the use of it, from being Profane
 19573	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand common, to be Holy, and peculiar to Gods service. But when by such
 19574	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twords, the nature of qualitie of the thing it selfe, is pretended to be
 19575	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tchanged, it is not Consecration, but either an extraordinary worke of
 19576	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod, or a vaine and impious Conjuration. But seeing (for the frequency
 19577	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof pretending the change of Nature in their Consecrations,) it cannot
 19578	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe esteemed a work extraordinary, it is no other than a Conjuration or
 19579	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIncantation, whereby they would have men to beleeve an alteration of
 19580	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNature that is not, contrary to the testimony of mans Sight, and of all
 19581	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe rest of his Senses. As for example, when the Priest, in stead of
 19582	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConsecrating Bread and Wine to Gods peculiar service in the Sacrament of
 19583	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Lords Supper, (which is but a separation of it from the common use,
 19584	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto signifie, that is, to put men in mind of their Redemption, by the
 19585	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPassion of Christ, whose body was broken, and blood shed upon the Crosse
 19586	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor our transgressions,) pretends, that by saying of the words of our
 19587	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSaviour, "This is my Body," and "This is my Blood," the nature of Bread
 19588	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis no more there, but his very Body; notwithstanding there appeared not
 19589	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto the Sight, or other Sense of the Receiver, any thing that appeareth
 19590	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot before the Consecration. The Egyptian Conjurers, that are said
 19591	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto have turned their Rods to Serpents, and the Water into Bloud, are
 19592	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthought but to have deluded the senses of the Spectators by a false shew
 19593	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof things, yet are esteemed Enchanters: But what should wee have thought
 19594	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof them, if there had appeared in their Rods nothing like a Serpent, and
 19595	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the Water enchanted, nothing like Bloud, nor like any thing else but
 19596	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWater, but that they had faced down the King, that they were Serpents
 19597	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat looked like Rods, and that it was Bloud that seemed Water? That
 19598	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thad been both Enchantment, and Lying. And yet in this daily act of
 19599	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Priest, they doe the very same, by turning the holy words into the
 19600	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmanner of a Charme, which produceth nothing now to the Sense; but they
 19601	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tface us down, that it hath turned the Bread into a Man; nay more, into
 19602	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta God; and require men to worship it, as if it were our Saviour himself
 19603	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpresent God and Man, and thereby to commit most grosse Idolatry. For if
 19604	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit bee enough to excuse it of Idolatry, to say it is no more Bread, but
 19605	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod; why should not the same excuse serve the Egyptians, in case they
 19606	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thad the faces to say, the Leeks, and Onyons they worshipped, were
 19607	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot very Leeks, and Onyons, but a Divinity under their Species, or
 19608	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlikenesse. The words, "This is my Body," are aequivalent to these,
 19609	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"This signifies, or represents my Body;" and it is an ordinary figure of
 19610	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSpeech: but to take it literally, is an abuse; nor though so taken, can
 19611	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit extend any further, than to the Bread which Christ himself with his
 19612	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\town hands Consecrated. For hee never said, that of what Bread soever,
 19613	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tany Priest whatsoever, should say, "This is my Body," or, "This is
 19614	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChrists Body," the same should presently be transubstantiated. Nor did
 19615	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Church of Rome ever establish this Transubstantiation, till the time
 19616	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Innocent the third; which was not above 500. years agoe, when the
 19617	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPower of Popes was at the Highest, and the Darknesse of the time grown
 19618	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tso great, as men discerned not the Bread that was given them to eat,
 19619	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tespecially when it was stamped with the figure of Christ upon the
 19620	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCrosse, as if they would have men beleeve it were Transubstantiated, not
 19621	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tonely into the Body of Christ, but also into the Wood of his Crosse, and
 19622	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat they did eat both together in the Sacrament.

 19628	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19629	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe like incantation, in stead of Consecration, is used also in the
 19630	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSacrament of Baptisme: Where the abuse of Gods name in each severall
 19631	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPerson, and in the whole Trinity, with the sign of the Crosse at each
 19632	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tname, maketh up the Charm: As first, when they make the Holy water, the
 19633	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPriest saith, "I Conjure thee, thou Creature of Water, in the name of
 19634	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod the Father Almighty, and in the name of Jesus Christ his onely Son
 19635	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tour Lord, and in vertue of the Holy Ghost, that thou become Conjured
 19636	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twater, to drive away all the Powers of the Enemy, and to eradicate, and
 19637	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsupplant the Enemy, &c." And the same in the Benediction of the Salt
 19638	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto be mingled with it; "That thou become Conjured Salt, that all
 19639	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPhantasmes, and Knavery of the Devills fraud may fly and depart from the
 19640	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tplace wherein thou art sprinkled; and every unclean Spirit bee Conjured
 19641	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby Him that shall come to judge the quicke and the dead." The same in
 19642	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Benediction of the Oyle. "That all the Power of the Enemy, all the
 19643	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHost of the Devill, all Assaults and Phantasmes of Satan, may be
 19644	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdriven away by this Creature of Oyle." And for the Infant that is to be
 19645	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBaptized, he is subject to many Charms; First, at the Church dore the
 19646	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPriest blows thrice in the Childs face, and sayes, "Goe out of him
 19647	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunclean Spirit, and give place to the Holy Ghost the Comforter." As
 19648	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tif all Children, till blown on by the Priest were Daemoniaques: Again,
 19649	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbefore his entrance into the Church, he saith as before, "I Conjure
 19650	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthee, &c. to goe out, and depart from this Servant of God:" And again
 19651	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe same Exorcisme is repeated once more before he be Baptized. These,
 19652	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand some other Incantations, and Consecrations, in administration of the
 19653	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSacraments of Baptisme, and the Lords Supper; wherein every thing that
 19654	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tserveth to those holy men (except the unhallowed Spittle of the Priest)
 19655	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thath some set form of Exorcisme.

 19672	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tErrors From Mistaking Eternall Life, And Everlasting Death
 19673	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19674	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnother generall Error, is from the Misinterpretation of the words
 19675	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEternall Life, Everlasting Death, and the Second Death. For though we
 19676	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tread plainly in Holy Scripture, that God created Adam in an estate of
 19677	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLiving for Ever, which was conditionall, that is to say, if he disobeyed
 19678	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot his Commandement; which was not essentiall to Humane Nature, but
 19679	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsequent to the vertue of the Tree of Life; whereof hee had liberty
 19680	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto eat, as long as hee had not sinned; and that hee was thrust out of
 19681	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tParadise after he had sinned, lest hee should eate thereof, and live for
 19682	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tever; and that Christs Passion is a Discharge of sin to all that beleeve
 19683	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ton him; and by consequence, a restitution of Eternall Life, to all the
 19684	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFaithfull, and to them onely: yet the Doctrine is now, and hath been a
 19685	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlong time far otherwise; namely, that every man hath Eternity of Life by
 19686	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNature, in as much as his Soul is Immortall: So that the flaming Sword
 19687	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tat the entrance of Paradise, though it hinder a man from coming to the
 19688	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTree of Life, hinders him not from the Immortality which God took from
 19689	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim for his Sin; nor makes him to need the sacrificing of Christ, for
 19690	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe recovering of the same; and consequently, not onely the faithfull
 19691	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand righteous, but also the wicked, and the Heathen, shall enjoy
 19692	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEternall Life, without any Death at all; much lesse a Second, and
 19693	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEverlasting Death. To salve this, it is said, that by Second, and
 19694	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEverlasting Death, is meant a Second, and Everlasting Life, but in
 19695	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTorments; a Figure never used, but in this very Case.
 19696	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19697	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAll which Doctrine is founded onely on some of the obscurer places of
 19698	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe New Testament; which neverthelesse, the whole scope of the Scripture
 19699	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsidered, are cleer enough in a different sense, and unnecessary to
 19700	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Christian Faith. For supposing that when a man dies, there remaineth
 19701	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnothing of him but his carkasse; cannot God that raised inanimated dust
 19702	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand clay into a living creature by his Word, as easily raise a dead
 19703	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcarkasse to life again, and continue him alive for Ever, or make him
 19704	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdie again, by another Word? The Soule in Scripture, signifieth alwaies,
 19705	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teither the Life, or the Living Creature; and the Body and Soule jointly,
 19706	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Body Alive. In the fift day of the Creation, God said, Let the water
 19707	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tproduce Reptile Animae Viventis, the creeping thing that hath in it a
 19708	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLiving Soule; the English translate it, "that hath Life:" And again,
 19709	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod created Whales, "& omnem animam viventem;" which in the English is,
 19710	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"every living Creature:" And likewise of Man, God made him of the dust
 19711	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the earth, and breathed in his face the breath of Life, "& factus est
 19712	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHomo in animam viventem," that is, "and Man was made a Living Creature;"
 19713	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd after Noah came out of the Arke, God saith, hee will no more smite
 19714	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"omnem animam viventem," that is "every Living Creature;" And Deut.
 19715	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t12.23. "Eate not the Bloud, for the Bloud is the Soule;" that is
 19716	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"the Life." From which places, if by Soule were meant a Substance
 19717	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIncorporeall, with an existence separated from the Body, it might as
 19718	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twell be inferred of any other living Creature, as of Man. But that
 19719	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Souls of the Faithfull, are not of their own Nature, but by Gods
 19720	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tspeciall Grace, to remaine in their bodies, from the Resurrection to
 19721	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall Eternity, I have already I think sufficiently proved out of the
 19722	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tScriptures, in the 38. Chapter. And for the places of the New Testament,
 19723	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhere it is said that any man shall be cast Body and Soul into Hell
 19724	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfire, it is no more than Body and Life; that is to say, they shall be
 19725	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcast alive into the perpetuall fire of Gehenna.

 19732	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThis window it is, that gives entrance to the Dark Doctrine, first, of
 19733	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEternall Torments; and afterwards of Purgatory, and consequently of the
 19734	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twalking abroad, especially in places Consecrated, Solitary, or Dark, of
 19735	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Ghosts of men deceased; and thereby to the pretences of Exorcisme
 19736	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Conjuration of Phantasmes; as also of Invocation of men dead; and to
 19737	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Doctrine of Indulgences; that is to say, of exemption for a time,

 19739	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSubstances are pretended by burning to be cleansed, and made fit
 19740	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor Heaven. For men being generally possessed before the time of our
 19741	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSaviour, by contagion of the Daemonology of the Greeks, of an opinion,
 19742	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat the Souls of men were substances distinct from their Bodies, and
 19743	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore that when the Body was dead, the Soule of every man, whether
 19744	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgodly, or wicked, must subsist somewhere by vertue of its own nature,
 19745	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twithout acknowledging therein any supernaturall gift of Gods; the
 19746	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDoctors of the Church doubted a long time, what was the place, which
 19747	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey were to abide in, till they should be re-united to their Bodies in
 19748	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Resurrection; supposing for a while, they lay under the Altars: but
 19749	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tafterward the Church of Rome found it more profitable, to build for them
 19750	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis place of Purgatory; which by some other Churches in this later age,

 19763	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Pope, (than which there are none that make a better show of proof,)
 19764	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tI have already answered them; and made it evident, that the Kingdome
 19765	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof God, instituted by Moses, ended in the election of Saul: After which
 19766	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttime the Priest of his own authority never deposed any King. That which
 19767	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe High Priest did to Athaliah, was not done in his own right, but in
 19768	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe right of the young King Joash her Son: But Solomon in his own right
 19769	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdeposed the High Priest Abiathar, and set up another in his place. The
 19770	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmost difficult place to answer, of all those than can be brought,
 19771	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto prove the Kingdome of God by Christ is already in this world, is
 19772	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talledged, not by Bellarmine, nor any other of the Church of Rome; but
 19773	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby Beza; that will have it to begin from the Resurrection of Christ.
 19774	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut whether hee intend thereby, to entitle the Presbytery to the Supreme
 19775	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPower Ecclesiasticall in the Common-wealth of Geneva, (and consequently
 19776	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto every Presbytery in every other Common-wealth,) or to Princes,
 19777	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand other Civill Soveraignes, I doe not know. For the Presbytery hath
 19778	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tchallenged the power to Excommunicate their owne Kings, and to bee the
 19779	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSupreme Moderators in Religion, in the places where they have that form
 19780	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Church government, no lesse then the Pope challengeth it universally.

 19785	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnswer To The Text On Which Beza Infereth
 19786	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19787	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThat The Kingdome Of Christ Began At The Resurrection The words are
 19788	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(Marke 9.1.) "Verily, I say unto you, that there be some of them that
 19789	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tstand here, which shall not tast of death, till they have seene the
 19790	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKingdome of God come with power." Which words, if taken grammatically,
 19791	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmake it certaine, that either some of those men that stood by Christ at
 19792	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat time, are yet alive; or else, that the Kingdome of God must be now
 19793	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin this present world. And then there is another place more difficult:
 19794	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor when the Apostles after our Saviours Resurrection, and immediately
 19795	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbefore his Ascension, asked our Saviour, saying, (Acts.1.6.) "Wilt thou
 19796	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tat this time restore again the Kingdome to Israel," he answered them,
 19797	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"It is not for you to know the times and the seasons, which the Father
 19798	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thath put in his own power; But ye shall receive power by the comming of
 19799	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Holy Ghost upon you, and yee shall be my (Martyrs) witnesses both in
 19800	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJerusalem, & in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part
 19801	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Earth:" Which is as much as to say, My Kingdome is not yet come,
 19802	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnor shall you foreknow when it shall come, for it shall come as a theefe
 19803	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the night; But I will send you the Holy Ghost, and by him you shall
 19804	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave power to beare witnesse to all the world (by your preaching) of
 19805	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmy Resurrection, and the workes I have done, and the doctrine I have
 19806	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttaught, that they may beleeve in me, and expect eternall life, at my
 19807	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcomming againe: How does this agree with the comming of Christs Kingdome
 19808	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tat the Resurrection? And that which St. Paul saies (1 Thessal. 1.9, 10.)
 19809	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"That they turned from Idols, to serve the living and true God, and
 19810	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto waite for his Sonne from Heaven:" Where to waite for his Sonne from
 19811	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHeaven, is to wait for his comming to be King in power; which were
 19812	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot necessary, if this Kingdome had beene then present. Againe, if the
 19813	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKingdome of God began (as Beza on that place (Mark 9.1.) would have it)
 19814	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tat the Resurrection; what reason is there for Christians ever since the
 19815	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tResurrection to say in their prayers, "Let thy Kingdome Come"? It
 19816	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis therefore manifest, that the words of St. Mark are not so to be
 19817	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinterpreted. There be some of them that stand here (saith our Saviour)
 19818	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat shall not tast of death till they have seen the Kingdome of God
 19819	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcome in power. If then this Kingdome were to come at the Resurrection
 19820	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Christ, why is it said, "some of them" rather than all? For they all
 19821	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlived till after Christ was risen.

 19826	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tExplication Of The Place In Mark 9.1
 19827	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19828	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut they that require an exact interpretation of this text, let them
 19829	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinterpret first the like words of our Saviour to St. Peter concerning
 19830	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSt. John, (chap. 21.22.) "If I will that he tarry till I come, what is
 19831	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat to thee?" upon which was grounded a report that hee should not dye:
 19832	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNeverthelesse the truth of that report was neither confirmed, as well
 19833	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgrounded; nor refuted, as ill grounded on those words; but left as a
 19834	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsaying not understood. The same difficulty is also in the place of St.
 19835	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMarke. And if it be lawfull to conjecture at their meaning, by that
 19836	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich immediately followes, both here, and in St. Luke, where the same
 19837	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis againe repeated, it is not unprobable, to say they have relation
 19838	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto the Transfiguration, which is described in the verses immediately
 19839	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfollowing; where it is said, that "After six dayes Jesus taketh with
 19840	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim Peter, and James, and John (not all, but some of his Disciples)
 19841	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand leadeth them up into an high mountaine apart by themselves, and
 19842	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas transfigured before them. And his rayment became shining, exceeding
 19843	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhite as snow; so as no Fuller on earth can white them. And there
 19844	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tappeared unto them Elias with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus,
 19845	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t&c." So that they saw Christ in Glory and Majestie, as he is to come;
 19846	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinsomuch as "They were sore afraid." And thus the promise of our Saviour
 19847	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas accomplished by way of Vision: For it was a Vision, as may probably
 19848	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbee inferred out of St. Luke, that reciteth the same story (ch. 9. ve.
 19849	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t28.) and saith, that Peter and they that were with him, were heavy with
 19850	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsleep; But most certainly out of Matth. 17.9. (where the same is again
 19851	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trelated;) for our Saviour charged them, saying, "Tell no man the Vision
 19852	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tuntill the Son of man be Risen from the dead." Howsoever it be, yet
 19853	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere can from thence be taken no argument, to prove that the Kingdome
 19854	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof God taketh beginning till the day of Judgement.

 19860	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19861	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAs for some other texts, to prove the Popes Power over civill
 19862	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraignes (besides those of Bellarmine;) as that the two Swords that
 19863	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChrist and his Apostles had amongst them, were the Spirituall and the
 19864	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTemporall Sword, which they say St. Peter had given him by Christ: And,
 19865	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat of the two Luminaries, the greater signifies the Pope, and the
 19866	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlesser the King; One might as well inferre out of the first verse of the
 19867	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBible, that by Heaven is meant the Pope, and by Earth the King: Which
 19868	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis not arguing from Scripture, but a wanton insulting over Princes, that
 19869	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcame in fashion after the time the Popes were growne so secure of their
 19870	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgreatnesse, as to contemne all Christian Kings; and Treading on the
 19871	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnecks of Emperours, to mocke both them, and the Scripture, in the words
 19872	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the 91. Psalm, "Thou shalt Tread upon the Lion and the Adder, the
 19873	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tyoung Lion and the Dragon thou shalt Trample under thy feet."

 19878	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Manner Of Consecrations In The Scripture, Was Without Exorcisms
 19879	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19880	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAs for the rites of Consecration, though they depend for the most part
 19881	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tupon the discretion and judgement of the governors of the Church,
 19882	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand not upon the Scriptures; yet those governors are obliged to such
 19883	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdirection, as the nature of the action it selfe requireth; as that the
 19884	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tceremonies, words, and gestures, be both decent, and significant, or at
 19885	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tleast conformable to the action. When Moses consecrated the Tabernacle,
 19886	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Altar, and the Vessels belonging to them (Exod. 40.) he anointed
 19887	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem with the Oyle which God had commanded to bee made for that
 19888	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpurpose; and they were holy; There was nothing Exorcised, to drive away
 19889	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPhantasmes. The same Moses (the civill Soveraigne of Israel) when he
 19890	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsecrated Aaron (the High Priest,) and his Sons, did wash them with
 19891	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWater, (not Exorcised water,) put their Garments upon them, and anointed
 19892	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem with Oyle; and they were sanctified, to minister unto the Lord
 19893	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the Priests office; which was a simple and decent cleansing, and
 19894	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tadorning them, before hee presented them to God, to be his servants.
 19895	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhen King Solomon, (the civill Soveraigne of Israel) consecrated the
 19896	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTemple hee had built, (2 Kings 8.) he stood before all the Congregation
 19897	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Israel; and having blessed them, he gave thanks to God, for putting
 19898	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinto the heart of his father, to build it; and for giving to himselfe
 19899	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe grace to accomplish the same; and then prayed unto him, first,
 19900	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto accept that House, though it were not sutable to his infinite
 19901	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGreatnesse; and to hear the prayers of his Servants that should pray
 19902	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherein, or (if they were absent) towards it; and lastly, he offered a
 19903	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsacrifice of Peace-offering, and the House was dedicated. Here was no
 19904	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tProcession; the King stood still in his first place; no Exorcised Water;
 19905	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tno Asperges Me, nor other impertinent application of words spoken upon
 19906	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tanother occasion; but a decent, and rationall speech, and such as in
 19907	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmaking to God a present of his new built House, was most conformable
 19908	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto the occasion. We read not that St. John did Exorcise the Water
 19909	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Jordan; nor Philip the Water of the river wherein he baptized the
 19910	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEunuch; nor that any Pastor in the time of the Apostles, did take his
 19911	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tspittle, and put it to the nose of the person to be Baptized, and say,
 19912	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"In odorem suavitatis," that is, "for a sweet savour unto the Lord;"
 19913	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twherein neither the Ceremony of Spittle, for the uncleannesse; nor the
 19914	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tapplication of that Scripture for the levity, can by any authority of

 19922	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut Of Grace
 19923	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19924	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo prove that the Soule separated from the Body liveth eternally, not
 19925	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tonely the Soules of the Elect, by especiall grace, and restauration of
 19926	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Eternall Life which Adam lost by Sinne, and our Saviour restored
 19927	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby the Sacrifice of himself, to the Faithfull, but also the Soules
 19928	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Reprobates, as a property naturally consequent to the essence of
 19929	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmankind, without other grace of God, but that which is universally given
 19930	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto all mankind; there are divers places, which at the first sight seem
 19931	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsufficiently to serve the turn: but such, as when I compare them with
 19932	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat which I have before (Chapter 38.) alledged out of the 14 of Job,
 19933	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tseem to mee much more subject to a divers interpretation, than the words
 19934	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Job.
 19935	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19936	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd first there are the words of Solomon (Ecclesiastes 12.7.) "Then
 19937	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshall the Dust return to Dust, as it was, and the Spirit shall return to
 19938	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod that gave it." Which may bear well enough (if there be no other text
 19939	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdirectly against it) this interpretation, that God onely knows, (but
 19940	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMan not,) what becomes of a mans spirit, when he expireth; and the same
 19941	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSolomon, in the same Book, (Chap. 3. ver. 20,21.) delivereth in the same
 19942	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsentence in the sense I have given it: His words are, "All goe, (man
 19943	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand beast) to the same place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust
 19944	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagain; who knoweth that the spirit of Man goeth upward, and the spirit
 19945	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Beast goeth downward to the earth?" That is, none knows but God;
 19946	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNor is it an unusuall phrase to say of things we understand not, "God
 19947	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tknows what," and "God knows where." That of Gen. 5.24. "Enoch walked
 19948	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith God, and he was not; for God took him;" which is expounded Heb.
 19949	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t13.5. "He was translated, that he should not die; and was not found,
 19950	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbecause God had translated him. For before his Translation, he had this
 19951	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttestimony, that he pleased God," making as much for the Immortality
 19952	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Body, as of the Soule, proveth, that this his translation was
 19953	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpeculiar to them that please God; not common to them with the wicked;
 19954	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand depending on Grace, not on Nature. But on the contrary, what
 19955	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinterpretation shall we give, besides the literall sense of the words of
 19956	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSolomon (Eccles. 3.19.) "That which befalleth the Sons of Men, befalleth
 19957	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBeasts, even one thing befalleth them; as the one dyeth, so doth the
 19958	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother; yea, they have all one breath (one spirit;) so that a Man hath no
 19959	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpraeeminence above a Beast, for all is vanity." By the literall sense,
 19960	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\there is no Naturall Immortality of the Soule; nor yet any repugnancy
 19961	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith the Life Eternall, which the Elect shall enjoy by Grace. And (chap.
 19962	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t4. ver.3.) "Better is he that hath not yet been, than both they;" that
 19963	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis, than they that live, or have lived; which, if the Soule of all them
 19964	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat have lived, were Immortall, were a hard saying; for then to have
 19965	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tan Immortall Soule, were worse than to have no Soule at all. And
 19966	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagaine,(Chapt. 9.5.) "The living know they shall die, but the dead know
 19967	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot any thing;" that is, Naturally, and before the resurrection of the
 19968	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbody.
 19969	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19970	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnother place which seems to make for a Naturall Immortality of the
 19971	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoule, is that, where our Saviour saith, that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
 19972	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare living: but this is spoken of the promise of God, and of their
 19973	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcertitude to rise again, not of a Life then actuall; and in the same
 19974	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsense that God said to Adam, that on the day hee should eate of the
 19975	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tforbidden fruit, he should certainly die; from that time forward he was
 19976	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta dead man by sentence; but not by execution, till almost a thousand
 19977	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tyears after. So Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were alive by promise, then,
 19978	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhen Christ spake; but are not actually till the Resurrection. And the
 19979	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHistory of Dives and Lazarus, make nothing against this, if wee take it
 19980	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(as it is) for a Parable.
 19981	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19982	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut there be other places of the New Testament, where an Immortality
 19983	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tseemeth to be directly attributed to the wicked. For it is evident, that
 19984	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey shall all rise to Judgement. And it is said besides in many places,
 19985	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat they shall goe into "Everlasting fire, Everlasting torments,
 19986	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEverlasting punishments; and that the worm of conscience never dyeth;"
 19987	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand all this is comprehended in the word Everlasting Death, which is
 19988	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tordinarily interpreted Everlasting Life In Torments: And yet I can find
 19989	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tno where that any man shall live in torments Everlastingly. Also, it
 19990	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tseemeth hard, to say, that God who is the Father of Mercies, that doth
 19991	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin Heaven and Earth all that hee will; that hath the hearts of all men
 19992	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin his disposing; that worketh in men both to doe, and to will; and
 19993	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twithout whose free gift a man hath neither inclination to good, nor
 19994	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trepentance of evill, should punish mens transgressions without any end
 19995	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof time, and with all the extremity of torture, that men can imagine,
 19996	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand more. We are therefore to consider, what the meaning is, of
 19997	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEverlasting Fire, and other the like phrases of Scripture.
 19998	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 19999	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tI have shewed already, that the Kingdome of God by Christ beginneth at
 20000	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe day of Judgment: That in that day, the Faithfull shall rise again,
 20001	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith glorious, and spirituall Bodies, and bee his Subjects in that his
 20002	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKingdome, which shall be Eternall; That they shall neither marry, nor
 20003	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe given in marriage, nor eate and drink, as they did in their naturall
 20004	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbodies; but live for ever in their individuall persons, without the
 20005	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tspecificall eternity of generation: And that the Reprobates also shall
 20006	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trise again, to receive punishments for their sins: As also, that those
 20007	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Elect, which shall be alive in their earthly bodies at that
 20008	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tday, shall have their bodies suddenly changed, and made spirituall, and
 20009	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tImmortall. But that the bodies of the Reprobate, who make the Kingdome
 20010	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Satan, shall also be glorious, or spirituall bodies, or that they
 20011	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshall bee as the Angels of God, neither eating, nor drinking, nor
 20012	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tengendring; or that their life shall be Eternall in their individuall
 20013	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpersons, as the life of every faithfull man is, or as the life of Adam
 20014	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thad been if hee had not sinned, there is no place of Scripture to prove
 20015	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit; save onely these places concerning Eternall Torments; which may
 20016	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\totherwise be interpreted.
 20017	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20018	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFrom whence may be inferred, that as the Elect after the Resurrection
 20019	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshall be restored to the estate, wherein Adam was before he had sinned;
 20020	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tso the Reprobate shall be in the estate, that Adam, and his posterity
 20021	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere in after the sin committed; saving that God promised a Redeemer to
 20022	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAdam, and such of his seed as should trust in him, and repent; but not
 20023	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto them that should die in their sins, as do the Reprobate.

 20028	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEternall Torments What
 20029	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20030	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThese things considered, the texts that mention Eternall Fire, Eternal
 20031	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTorments, or the Word That Never Dieth, contradict not the Doctrine of
 20032	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Second, and Everlasting Death, in the proper and naturall sense of the
 20033	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tword Death. The Fire, or Torments prepared for the wicked in Gehenna,
 20034	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTophet, or in what place soever, may continue for ever; and there may
 20035	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnever want wicked men to be tormented in them; though not every, nor
 20036	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tany one Eternally. For the wicked being left in the estate they were in
 20037	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tafter Adams sin, may at the Resurrection live as they did, marry, and
 20038	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgive in marriage, and have grosse and corruptible bodies, as all
 20039	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmankind now have; and consequently may engender perpetually, after the
 20040	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tResurrection, as they did before: For there is no place of Scripture to
 20041	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe contrary. For St. Paul, speaking of the Resurrection (1 Cor. 15.)
 20042	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunderstandeth it onely of the Resurrection to Life Eternall; and not the
 20043	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tResurrection to Punishment. And of the first, he saith that the Body is
 20044	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"Sown in Corruption, raised in Incorruption; sown in Dishonour, raised
 20045	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin Honour; sown in Weaknesse, raised in Power; sown a Naturall body,
 20046	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\traised a Spirituall body:" There is no such thing can be said of the
 20047	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbodies of them that rise to Punishment. The text is Luke 20. Verses
 20048	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t34,35,36. a fertile text. "The Children of this world marry, and are
 20049	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgiven in marriage; but they that shall be counted worthy to obtaine that
 20050	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tworld, and the Resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given
 20051	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin marriage: Neither can they die any more; for they are equall to
 20052	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Angells, and are the Children of God, being the Children of the
 20053	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tResurrection:" The Children of this world, that are in the estate
 20054	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich Adam left them in, shall marry, and be given in marriage; that is
 20055	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcorrupt, and generate successively; which is an Immortality of the Kind,
 20056	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut not of the Persons of men: They are not worthy to be counted amongst
 20057	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem that shall obtain the next world, and an absolute Resurrection from
 20058	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe dead; but onely a short time, as inmates of that world; and to the
 20059	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tend onely to receive condign punishment for their contumacy. The Elect
 20060	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare the onely children of the Resurrection; that is to say the sole
 20061	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\theirs of Eternall Life: they only can die no more; it is they that are
 20062	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tequall to the Angels, and that are the children of God; and not the
 20063	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tReprobate. To the Reprobate there remaineth after the Resurrection,
 20064	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Second, and Eternall Death: between which Resurrection, and their
 20065	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSecond, and Eternall death, is but a time of Punishment and Torment; and
 20066	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto last by succession of sinners thereunto, as long as the kind of Man
 20067	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby propagation shall endure, which is Eternally.

 20071	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20072	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnswer Of The Texts Alledged For Purgatory
 20073	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20074	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tUpon this Doctrine of the Naturall Eternity of separated Soules, is
 20075	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfounded (as I said) the Doctrine of Purgatory. For supposing Eternall
 20076	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLife by Grace onely, there is no Life, but the Life of the Body; and no
 20077	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tImmortality till the Resurrection. The texts for Purgatory alledged by
 20078	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBellarmine out of the Canonicall Scripture of the old Testament, are
 20079	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfirst, the Fasting of David for Saul and Jonathan, mentioned (2 Kings,
 20080	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t1. 12.); and againe, (2 Sam. 3. 35.) for the death of Abner. This
 20081	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFasting of David, he saith, was for the obtaining of something for them
 20082	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tat Gods hands, after their death; because after he had Fasted to procure
 20083	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe recovery of his owne child, assoone as he know it was dead, he
 20084	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcalled for meate. Seeing then the Soule hath an existence separate from
 20085	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Body, and nothing can be obtained by mens Fasting for the Soules
 20086	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat are already either in Heaven, or Hell, it followeth that there be
 20087	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsome Soules of dead men, what are neither in Heaven, nor in Hell; and
 20088	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore they must bee in some third place, which must be Purgatory.
 20089	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd thus with hard straining, hee has wrested those places to the proofe
 20090	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof a Purgatory; whereas it is manifest, that the ceremonies of Mourning,
 20091	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Fasting, when they are used for the death of men, whose life was
 20092	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot profitable to the Mourners, they are used for honours sake to their
 20093	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpersons; and when tis done for the death of them by whose life the
 20094	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMourners had benefit, it proceeds from their particular dammage: And so
 20095	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDavid honoured Saul, and Abner, with his Fasting; and in the death of
 20096	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this owne child, recomforted himselfe, by receiving his ordinary food.
 20097	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20098	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn the other places, which he alledgeth out of the old Testament, there
 20099	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis not so much as any shew, or colour of proofe. He brings in every text
 20100	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twherein there is the word Anger, or Fire, or Burning, or Purging, or
 20101	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tClensing, in case any of the Fathers have but in a Sermon rhetorically
 20102	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tapplied it to the Doctrine of Purgatory, already beleeved. The first
 20103	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tverse of Psalme, 37. "O Lord rebuke me not in thy wrath, nor chasten me
 20104	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin thy hot displeasure:" What were this to Purgatory, if Augustine had
 20105	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot applied the Wrath to the fire of Hell, and the Displeasure, to that
 20106	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Purgatory? And what is it to Purgatory, that of Psalme, 66. 12. "Wee
 20107	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twent through fire and water, and thou broughtest us to a moist place;"
 20108	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand other the like texts, (with which the Doctors of those times
 20109	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tentended to adorne, or extend their Sermons, or Commentaries) haled to
 20110	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir purposes by force of wit?

 20115	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPlaces Of The New Testament For Purgatory Answered
 20116	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20117	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut he alledgeth other places of the New Testament, that are not
 20118	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tso easie to be answered: And first that of Matth. 12.32. "Whosoever
 20119	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tspeaketh a word against the Sonne of man, it shall be forgiven him; but
 20120	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not bee forgiven
 20121	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim neither in this world, nor in the world to come:" Where he will have
 20122	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPurgatory to be the World to come, wherein some sinnes may be forgiven,
 20123	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich in this World were not forgiven: notwithstanding that it is
 20124	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmanifest, there are but three Worlds; one from the Creation to the
 20125	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFlood, which was destroyed by Water, and is called in Scripture the
 20126	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOld World; another from the Flood to the day of Judgement, which is the
 20127	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPresent World, and shall bee destroyed by Fire; and the third, which
 20128	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshall bee from the day of Judgement forward, everlasting, which is
 20129	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcalled the World To Come; and in which it is agreed by all, there shall
 20130	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe no Purgatory; And therefore the World to come, and Purgatory, are
 20131	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinconsistent. But what then can bee the meaning of those our Saviours
 20132	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twords? I confesse they are very hardly to bee reconciled with all the
 20133	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDoctrines now unanimously received: Nor is it any shame, to confesse the
 20134	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprofoundnesse of the Scripture, to bee too great to be sounded by the
 20135	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshortnesse of humane understanding. Neverthelesse, I may propound such
 20136	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthings to the consideration of more learned Divines, as the text it
 20137	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tselfe suggesteth. And first, seeing to speake against the Holy Ghost, as
 20138	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeing the third Person of the Trinity, is to speake against the Church,
 20139	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin which the Holy Ghost resideth; it seemeth the comparison is made,
 20140	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbetweene the Easinesse of our Saviour, in bearing with offences done to
 20141	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim while he was on earth, and the Severity of the Pastors after him,
 20142	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagainst those which should deny their authority, which was from the Holy
 20143	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGhost: As if he should say, You that deny my Power; nay you that shall
 20144	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcrucifie me, shall be pardoned by mee, as often as you turne unto mee by
 20145	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRepentance: But if you deny the Power of them that teach you hereafter,
 20146	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby vertue of the Holy Ghost, they shall be inexorable, and shall not
 20147	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tforgive you, but persecute you in this World, and leave you without
 20148	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tabsolution, (though you turn to me, unlesse you turn also to them,) to
 20149	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe punishments (as much as lies in them) of the World to come: And
 20150	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tso the words may be taken as a Prophecy, or Praediction concerning the
 20151	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttimes, as they have along been in the Christian Church: Or if this be
 20152	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot the meaning, (for I am not peremptory in such difficult places,)
 20153	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tperhaps there may be place left after the Resurrection for the
 20154	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRepentance of some sinners: And there is also another place, that
 20155	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tseemeth to agree therewith. For considering the words of St. Paul (1
 20156	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCor. 15. 29.) "What shall they doe which are Baptized for the dead, if
 20157	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe dead rise not at all? why also are they Baptized for the dead?" a
 20158	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman may probably inferre, as some have done, that in St. Pauls time,
 20159	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere was a custome by receiving Baptisme for the dead, (as men that now
 20160	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeleeve, are Sureties and Undertakers for the Faith of Infants, that
 20161	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare not capable of beleeving,) to undertake for the persons of their
 20162	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdeceased friends, that they should be ready to obey, and receive our
 20163	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSaviour for their King, at his coming again; and then the forgivenesse
 20164	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof sins in the world to come, has no need of a Purgatory. But in both
 20165	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthese interpretations, there is so much of paradox, that I trust not
 20166	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto them; but propound them to those that are throughly versed in the
 20167	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tScripture, to inquire if there be no clearer place that contradicts
 20168	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem. Onely of thus much, I see evident Scripture, to perswade men, that
 20169	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere is neither the word, nor the thing of Purgatory, neither in this,
 20170	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnor any other text; nor any thing that can prove a necessity of a place
 20171	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor the Soule without the Body; neither for the Soule of Lazarus during
 20172	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe four days he was dead; nor for the Soules of them which the Romane
 20173	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChurch pretend to be tormented now in Purgatory. For God, that could
 20174	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgive a life to a peece of clay, hath the same power to give life again
 20175	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto a dead man, and renew his inanimate, and rotten Carkasse, into a
 20176	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tglorious, spirituall, and immortall Body.
 20177	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20178	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnother place is that of 1 Cor. 3. where it is said that they which
 20179	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbuilt Stubble, Hay, &c. on the true Foundation, their work shall perish;
 20180	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut "they themselves shall be saved; but as through Fire:" This Fire, he
 20181	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twill have to be the Fire of Purgatory. The words, as I have said before,
 20182	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare an allusion to those of Zach. 13. 9. where he saith, "I will bring
 20183	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe third part through the Fire, and refine them as Silver is refined,
 20184	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand will try them as Gold is tryed;" Which is spoken of the comming of
 20185	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Messiah in Power and Glory; that is, at the day of Judgment, and
 20186	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConflagration of the present world; wherein the Elect shall not be
 20187	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsumed, but be refined; that is, depose their erroneous Doctrines, and
 20188	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTraditions, and have them as it were sindged off; and shall afterwards
 20189	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcall upon the name of the true God. In like manner, the Apostle saith
 20190	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof them, that holding this Foundation Jesus Is The Christ, shall build
 20191	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthereon some other Doctrines that be erroneous, that they shall not be
 20192	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsumed in that fire which reneweth the world, but shall passe through
 20193	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit to Salvation; but so, as to see, and relinquish their former Errours.
 20194	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Builders, are the Pastors; the Foundation, that Jesus Is The Christ;
 20195	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Stubble and Hay, False Consequences Drawn From It Through Ignorance,
 20196	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOr Frailty; the Gold, Silver, and pretious Stones, are their True
 20197	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDoctrines; and their Refining or Purging, the Relinquishing Of Their
 20198	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tErrors. In all which there is no colour at all for the burning of
 20199	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIncorporeall, that is to say, Impatible Souls.

 20203	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20204	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBaptisme For The Dead, How Understood
 20205	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20206	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tA third place is that of 1 Cor. 15. before mentioned, concerning
 20207	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBaptisme for the Dead: out of which he concludeth, first, that Prayers
 20208	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor the Dead are not unprofitable; and out of that, that there is a Fire
 20209	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Purgatory: But neither of them rightly. For of many interpretations
 20210	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the word Baptisme, he approveth this in the first place, that by
 20211	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBaptisme is meant (metaphorically) a Baptisme of Penance; and that men
 20212	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare in this sense Baptized, when they Fast, and Pray, and give Almes:
 20213	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd so Baptisme for the Dead, and Prayer of the Dead, is the same thing.
 20214	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut this is a Metaphor, of which there is no example, neither in
 20215	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Scripture, nor in any other use of language; and which is also
 20216	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdiscordant to the harmony, and scope of the Scripture. The word Baptisme
 20217	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis used (Mar. 10. 38. & Luk. 12. 59.) for being Dipped in ones own
 20218	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbloud, as Christ was upon the Cross, and as most of the Apostles
 20219	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere, for giving testimony of him. But it is hard to say, that Prayer,
 20220	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFasting, and Almes, have any similitude with Dipping. The same is used
 20221	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talso Mat. 3. 11. (which seemeth to make somewhat for Purgatory) for
 20222	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Purging with Fire. But it is evident the Fire and Purging here
 20223	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmentioned, is the same whereof the Prophet Zachary speaketh (chap. 13.
 20224	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tv. 9.) "I will bring the third part through the Fire, and will Refine
 20225	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem, &c." And St. Peter after him (1 Epist. 1. 7.) "That the triall
 20226	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof your Faith, which is much more precious than of Gold that perisheth,
 20227	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthough it be tryed with fire, might be found unto praise, and honour,
 20228	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand glory at the Appearing of Jesus Christ;" And St. Paul (1 Cor. 3.
 20229	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t13.) The Fire shall trie every mans work of what sort it is." But
 20230	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSt. Peter, and St. Paul speak of the Fire that shall be at the Second
 20231	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAppearing of Christ; and the Prophet Zachary of the Day of Judgment: And
 20232	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore this place of S. Mat. may be interpreted of the same; and then
 20233	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere will be no necessity of the Fire of Purgatory.
 20234	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20235	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnother interpretation of Baptisme for the Dead, is that which I
 20236	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave before mentioned, which he preferreth to the second place of
 20237	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprobability; And thence also he inferreth the utility of Prayer for the
 20238	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDead. For if after the Resurrection, such as have not heard of Christ,
 20239	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor not beleeved in him, may be received into Christs Kingdome; it is
 20240	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot in vain, after their death, that their friends should pray for them,
 20241	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttill they should be risen. But granting that God, at the prayers of the
 20242	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfaithfull, may convert unto him some of those that have not heard Christ
 20243	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpreached, and consequently cannot have rejected Christ, and that the
 20244	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcharity of men in that point, cannot be blamed; yet this concludeth
 20245	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnothing for Purgatory, because to rise from Death to Life, is one thing;
 20246	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto rise from Purgatory to Life is another; and being a rising from Life
 20247	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto Life, from a Life in torments to a Life in joy.
 20248	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20249	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tA fourth place is that of Mat. 5. 25. "Agree with thine Adversary
 20250	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tquickly, whilest thou art in the way with him, lest at any time the
 20251	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAdversary deliver thee to the Officer, and thou be cast into prison.
 20252	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tVerily I say unto thee, thou shalt by no means come out thence, till
 20253	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthou has paid the uttermost farthing." In which Allegory, the Offender
 20254	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis the Sinner; both the Adversary and the Judge is God; the Way is
 20255	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis Life; the Prison is the Grave; the Officer, Death; from which, the
 20256	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsinner shall not rise again to life eternall, but to a second Death,
 20257	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttill he have paid the utmost farthing, or Christ pay it for him by his
 20258	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPassion, which is a full Ransome for all manner of sin, as well lesser
 20259	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsins, as greater crimes; both being made by the passion of Christ
 20260	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tequally veniall.
 20261	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20262	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe fift place, is that of Matth. 5. 22. "Whosoever is angry with his
 20263	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBrother without a cause, shall be guilty in Judgment. And whosoever
 20264	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshall say to his Brother, RACHA, shall be guilty in the Councel. But
 20265	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhosoever shall say, Thou Foole, shall be guilty to hell fire." From
 20266	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich words he inferreth three sorts of Sins, and three sorts of
 20267	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPunishments; and that none of those sins, but the last, shall be
 20268	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpunished with hell fire; and consequently, that after this life, there
 20269	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis punishment of lesser sins in Purgatory. Of which inference, there is
 20270	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tno colour in any interpretation that hath yet been given to them: Shall
 20271	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere be a distinction after this life of Courts of Justice, as there
 20272	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas amongst the Jews in our Saviours time, to hear, and determine
 20273	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdivers sorts of Crimes; as the Judges, and the Councell? Shall not
 20274	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall Judicature appertain to Christ, and his Apostles? To understand
 20275	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore this text, we are not to consider it solitarily, but jointly
 20276	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith the words precedent, and subsequent. Our Saviour in this Chapter
 20277	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinterpreteth the Law of Moses; which the Jews thought was then
 20278	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfulfilled, when they had not transgressed the Grammaticall sense
 20279	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthereof, howsoever they had transgressed against the sentence, or
 20280	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmeaning of the Legislator. Therefore whereas they thought the Sixth
 20281	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommandement was not broken, but by Killing a man; nor the Seventh, but
 20282	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhen a man lay with a woman, not his wife; our Saviour tells them, the
 20283	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinward Anger of a man against his brother, if it be without just cause,
 20284	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis Homicide: You have heard (saith hee) the Law of Moses, "Thou shalt
 20285	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot Kill," and that "Whosoever shall Kill, shall be condemned before the
 20286	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJudges," or before the Session of the Seventy: But I say unto you, to
 20287	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe Angry with ones Brother without cause; or to say unto him Racha, or
 20288	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFoole, is Homicide, and shall be punished at the day of Judgment, and
 20289	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSession of Christ, and his Apostles, with Hell fire: so that those words
 20290	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere not used to distinguish between divers Crimes, and divers Courts
 20291	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Justice, and divers Punishments; but to taxe the distinction between
 20292	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsin, and sin, which the Jews drew not from the difference of the Will
 20293	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin Obeying God, but from the difference of their Temporall Courts of
 20294	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJustice; and to shew them that he that had the Will to hurt his Brother,
 20295	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthough the effect appear but in Reviling, or not at all, shall be cast
 20296	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinto hell fire, by the Judges, and by the Session, which shall be the
 20297	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsame, not different Courts at the day of Judgment. This Considered, what
 20298	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcan be drawn from this text, to maintain Purgatory, I cannot imagine.
 20299	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20300	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe sixth place is Luke 16. 9. "Make yee friends of the unrighteous
 20301	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMammon, that when yee faile, they may receive you into Everlasting
 20302	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTabernacles." This he alledges to prove Invocation of Saints departed.
 20303	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut the sense is plain, That we should make friends with our Riches, of
 20304	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Poore, and thereby obtain their Prayers whilest they live. "He that
 20305	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgiveth to the Poore, lendeth to the Lord. "The seventh is Luke 23. 42.
 20306	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"Lord remember me when thou commest into thy Kingdome:" Therefore, saith
 20307	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thee, there is Remission of sins after this life. But the consequence
 20308	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis not good. Our Saviour then forgave him; and at his comming againe in
 20309	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGlory, will remember to raise him againe to Life Eternall.
 20310	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20311	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Eight is Acts 2. 24. where St. Peter saith of Christ, "that God
 20312	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thad raised him up, and loosed the Paines of Death, because it was not
 20313	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpossible he should be holden of it;" Which hee interprets to bee a
 20314	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdescent of Christ into Purgatory, to loose some Soules there from their
 20315	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttorments; whereas it is manifest, that it was Christ that was loosed;
 20316	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit was hee that could not bee holden of Death, or the Grave; and not the
 20317	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSouls in Purgatory. But if that which Beza sayes in his notes on this
 20318	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tplace be well observed, there is none that will not see, that in stead
 20319	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Paynes, it should be Bands; and then there is no further cause to
 20320	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tseek for Purgatory in this Text.

 20331	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20332	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe impression made on the organs of Sight, by lucide Bodies, either in
 20333	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tone direct line, or in many lines, reflected from Opaque, or refracted
 20334	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the passage through Diaphanous Bodies, produceth in living Creatures,
 20335	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin whom God hath placed such Organs, an Imagination of the Object, from
 20336	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhence the Impression proceedeth; which Imagination is called Sight; and
 20337	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tseemeth not to bee a meer Imagination, but the Body it selfe without
 20338	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tus; in the same manner, as when a man violently presseth his eye, there
 20339	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tappears to him a light without, and before him, which no man perceiveth
 20340	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut himselfe; because there is indeed no such thing without him, but
 20341	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tonely a motion in the interiour organs, pressing by resistance
 20342	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\toutward, that makes him think so. And the motion made by this pressure,
 20343	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontinuing after the object which caused it is removed, is that we call
 20344	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tImagination, and Memory, and (in sleep, and sometimes in great distemper
 20345	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the organs by Sicknesse, or Violence) a Dream: of which things I have
 20346	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talready spoken briefly, in the second and third Chapters.
 20347	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20348	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThis nature of Sight having never been discovered by the ancient
 20349	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpretenders to Naturall Knowledge; much lesse by those that consider not
 20350	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthings so remote (as that Knowledge is) from their present use; it was
 20351	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thard for men to conceive of those Images in the Fancy, and in the Sense,
 20352	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\totherwise, than of things really without us: Which some (because they
 20353	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tvanish away, they know not whither, nor how,) will have to be absolutely
 20354	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIncorporeall, that is to say Immateriall, of Formes without Matter;
 20355	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tColour and Figure, without any coloured or figured Body; and that they
 20356	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcan put on Aiery bodies (as a garment) to make them Visible when
 20357	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey will to our bodily Eyes; and others say, are Bodies, and living
 20358	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCreatures, but made of Air, or other more subtile and aethereall Matter,
 20359	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich is, then, when they will be seen, condensed. But Both of them
 20360	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagree on one generall appellation of them, DAEMONS. As if the Dead of
 20361	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhom they Dreamed, were not Inhabitants of their own Brain, but of the
 20362	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAir, or of Heaven, or Hell; not Phantasmes, but Ghosts; with just
 20363	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas much reason, as if one should say, he saw his own Ghost in a
 20364	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLooking-Glasse, or the Ghosts of the Stars in a River; or call the
 20365	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tordinary apparition of the Sun, of the quantity of about a foot, the
 20366	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDaemon, or Ghost of that great Sun that enlighteneth the whole visible
 20367	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tworld: And by that means have feared them, as things of an unknown, that
 20368	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis, of an unlimited power to doe them good, or harme; and consequently,
 20369	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgiven occasion to the Governours of the Heathen Common-wealths to
 20370	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tregulate this their fear, by establishing that DAEMONOLOGY (in which
 20371	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Poets, as Principal Priests of the Heathen Religion, were specially
 20372	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\temployed, or reverenced) to the Publique Peace, and to the Obedience of
 20373	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSubjects necessary thereunto; and to make some of them Good Daemons,
 20374	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand others Evill; the one as a Spurre to the Observance, the other, as
 20375	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tReines to withhold them from Violation of the Laws.

 20382	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhat kind of things they were, to whom they attributed the name of
 20383	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDaemons, appeareth partly in the Genealogie of their Gods, written by
 20384	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHesiod, one of the most ancient Poets of the Graecians; and partly in

 20390	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20391	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHow That Doctrine Was Spread
 20392	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20393	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Graecians, by their Colonies and Conquests, communicated their
 20394	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLanguage and Writings into Asia, Egypt, and Italy; and therein, by
 20395	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnecessary consequence their Daemonology, or (as St. Paul calles it)
 20396	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"their Doctrines of Devils;" And by that meanes, the contagion was
 20397	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tderived also to the Jewes, both of Judaea, and Alexandria, and other
 20398	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tparts, whereinto they were dispersed. But the name of Daemon they did
 20399	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot (as the Graecians) attribute to Spirits both Good, and Evill; but
 20400	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto the Evill onely: And to the Good Daemons they gave the name of the
 20401	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSpirit of God; and esteemed those into whose bodies they entred to be
 20402	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tProphets. In summe, all singularity if Good, they attributed to the
 20403	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSpirit of God; and if Evill, to some Daemon, but a kakodaimen, an Evill
 20404	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDaemon, that is, a Devill. And therefore, they called Daemoniaques, that
 20405	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis, possessed by the Devill, such as we call Madmen or Lunatiques; or
 20406	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch as had the Falling Sicknesse; or that spoke any thing, which they
 20407	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor want of understanding, thought absurd: As also of an Unclean person
 20408	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin a notorious degree, they used to say he had an Unclean Spirit; of a
 20409	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDumbe man, that he had a Dumbe Devill; and of John Baptist (Math. 11.
 20410	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t18.) for the singularity of his fasting, that he had a Devill; and of
 20411	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tour Saviour, because he said, hee that keepeth his sayings should not
 20412	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsee Death In Aeternum, (John 8. 52.) "Now we know thou hast a Devill;
 20413	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAbraham is dead, and the Prophets are dead:" And again, because he said
 20414	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(John 7. 20.) "They went about to kill him," the people answered, "Thou
 20415	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thast a Devill, who goeth about to kill thee?" Whereby it is manifest,
 20416	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat the Jewes had the same opinions concerning Phantasmes, namely, that
 20417	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey were not Phantasmes that is, Idols of the braine, but things reall,
 20418	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand independent on the Fancy.

 20422	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20423	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhy Our Saviour Controlled It Not
 20424	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20425	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhich doctrine if it be not true, why (may some say) did not our Saviour
 20426	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontradict it, and teach the Contrary? nay why does he use on diverse
 20427	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\toccasions, such forms of speech as seem to confirm it? To this I answer,
 20428	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat first, where Christ saith, "A Spirit hath not flesh and bone,"
 20429	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthough hee shew that there be Spirits, yet he denies not that they are
 20430	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBodies: And where St. Paul sais, "We shall rise Spirituall Bodies," he
 20431	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tacknowledgeth the nature of Spirits, but that they are Bodily Spirits;
 20432	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich is not difficult to understand. For Air and many other things
 20433	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare Bodies, though not Flesh and Bone, or any other grosse body, to bee
 20434	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdiscerned by the eye. But when our Saviour speaketh to the Devill, and
 20435	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommandeth him to go out of a man, if by the Devill, be meant a Disease,
 20436	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas Phrenesy, or Lunacy, or a corporeal Spirit, is not the speech
 20437	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\timproper? can Diseases heare? or can there be a corporeall Spirit in a
 20438	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBody of Flesh and Bone, full already of vitall and animall Spirits?
 20439	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAre there not therefore Spirits, that neither have Bodies, nor are meer
 20440	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tImaginations? To the first I answer, that the addressing of our Saviours
 20441	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommand to the Madnesse, or Lunacy he cureth, is no more improper, then
 20442	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas his rebuking of the Fever, or of the Wind, and Sea; for neither
 20443	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdo these hear: Or than was the command of God, to the Light, to the
 20444	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFirmament, to the Sunne, and Starres, when he commanded them to bee; for
 20445	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey could not heare before they had a beeing. But those speeches are
 20446	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot improper, because they signifie the power of Gods Word: no more
 20447	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore is it improper, to command Madnesse, or Lunacy (under the
 20448	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tappellation of Devils, by which they were then commonly understood,)
 20449	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto depart out of a mans body. To the second, concerning their being
 20450	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIncorporeall, I have not yet observed any place of Scripture, from
 20451	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhence it can be gathered, that any man was ever possessed with any
 20452	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother Corporeal Spirit, but that of his owne, by which his body is
 20453	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnaturally moved.
 20454	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20455	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20456	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20457	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20458	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Scriptures Doe Not Teach That Spirits Are Incorporeall
 20459	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20460	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOur Saviour, immediately after the Holy Ghost descended upon him in the
 20461	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tform of a Dove, is said by St. Matthew (Chapt. 4. 1.) to have been "led
 20462	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tup by the Spirit into the Wildernesse;" and the same is recited (Luke 4.
 20463	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t1.) in these words, "Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost, was led in
 20464	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Spirit into the Wildernesse;" Whereby it is evident, that by
 20465	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSpirit there, is meant the Holy Ghost. This cannot be interpreted for
 20466	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Possession: For Christ, and the Holy Ghost, are but one and the same
 20467	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsubstance; which is no possession of one substance, or body, by another.
 20468	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd whereas in the verses following, he is said "to have been taken
 20469	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tup by the Devill into the Holy City, and set upon a pinnacle of the
 20470	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTemple," shall we conclude thence that hee was possessed of the Devill,
 20471	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor carryed thither by violence? And again, "carryed thence by the Devill
 20472	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinto an exceeding high mountain, who shewed him them thence all the
 20473	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKingdomes of the world:" herein, wee are not to beleeve he was either
 20474	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpossessed, or forced by the Devill; nor that any Mountaine is high
 20475	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tenough, (according to the literall sense,) to shew him one whole
 20476	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHemisphere. What then can be the meaning of this place, other than that
 20477	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the went of himself into the Wildernesse; and that this carrying of him
 20478	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tup and down, from the Wildernesse to the City, and from thence into a
 20479	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMountain, was a Vision? Conformable whereunto, is also the phrase of St.
 20480	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLuke, that hee was led into the Wildernesse, not By, but In the Spirit:
 20481	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhereas concerning His being Taken up into the Mountaine, and unto the
 20482	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPinnacle of the Temple, hee speaketh as St. Matthew doth. Which suiteth
 20483	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith the nature of a Vision.
 20484	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20485	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAgain, where St. Luke sayes of Judas Iscariot, that "Satan entred into
 20486	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim, and thereupon that he went and communed with the Chief Priests, and
 20487	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCaptaines, how he might betray Christ unto them:" it may be answered,
 20488	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat by the Entring of Satan (that is the Enemy) into him, is meant, the
 20489	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thostile and traiterous intention of selling his Lord and Master. For as
 20490	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby the Holy Ghost, is frequently in Scripture understood, the Graces and
 20491	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgood Inclinations given by the Holy Ghost; so by the Entring of
 20492	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSatan, may bee understood the wicked Cogitations, and Designes of the
 20493	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAdversaries of Christ, and his Disciples. For as it is hard to say,
 20494	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat the Devill was entred into Judas, before he had any such hostile
 20495	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdesigne; so it is impertinent to say, he was first Christs Enemy in his
 20496	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\theart, and that the Devill entred into him afterwards. Therefore the
 20497	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEntring of Satan, and his Wicked Purpose, was one and the same thing.
 20498	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20499	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut if there be no Immateriall Spirit, nor any Possession of mens bodies
 20500	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby any Spirit Corporeall, it may again be asked, why our Saviour and his
 20501	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tApostles did not teach the People so; and in such cleer words, as they
 20502	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmight no more doubt thereof. But such questions as these, are more
 20503	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcurious, than necessary for a Christian mans Salvation. Men may as well
 20504	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\taske, why Christ that could have given to all men Faith, Piety, and all
 20505	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmanner of morall Vertues, gave it to some onely, and not to all: and
 20506	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhy he left the search of naturall Causes, and Sciences, to the naturall
 20507	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tReason and Industry of men, and did not reveal it to all, or any man
 20508	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsupernaturally; and many other such questions: Of which neverthelesse
 20509	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere may be alledged probable and pious reasons. For as God, when he
 20510	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbrought the Israelites into the Land of Promise, did not secure them
 20511	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherein, by subduing all the Nations round about them; but left many of
 20512	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem, as thornes in their sides, to awaken from time to time their
 20513	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPiety and Industry: so our Saviour, in conducting us toward his heavenly
 20514	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKingdome, did not destroy all the difficulties of Naturall Questions;
 20515	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut left them to exercise our Industry, and Reason; the Scope of
 20516	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this preaching, being onely to shew us this plain and direct way to
 20517	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSalvation, namely, the beleef of this Article, "that he was the Christ,
 20518	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Son of the living God, sent into the world to sacrifice himselfe for
 20519	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tour Sins, and at his comming again, gloriously to reign over his Elect,
 20520	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand to save them from their Enemies eternally:" To which, the opinion
 20521	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Possession by Spirits, or Phantasmes, are no impediment in the way;
 20522	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthough it be to some an occasion of going out of the way, and to follow
 20523	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir own Inventions. If wee require of the Scripture an account of all
 20524	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tquestions, which may be raised to trouble us in the performance of Gods
 20525	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommands; we may as well complaine of Moses for not having set downe the
 20526	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttime of the creation of such Spirits, as well as of the Creation of the
 20527	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEarth, and Sea, and of Men, and Beasts. To conclude, I find in Scripture
 20528	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat there be Angels, and Spirits, good and evill; but not that they are
 20529	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIncorporeall, as are the Apparitions men see in the Dark, or in a Dream,
 20530	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor Vision; which the Latines call Spectra, and took for Daemons. And I
 20531	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfind that there are Spirits Corporeal, (though subtile and Invisible;)
 20532	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut not that any mans body was possessed, or inhabited by them; And that
 20533	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Bodies of the Saints shall be such, namely, Spirituall Bodies, as
 20534	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSt. Paul calls them.

 20539	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Power Of Casting Out Devills, Not The Same It Was In The Primitive
 20540	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20541	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChurch
 20542	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20543	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNeverthelesse, the contrary Doctrine, namely, that there be Incorporeall
 20544	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSpirits, hath hitherto so prevailed in the Church, that the use of
 20545	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tExorcisme, (that is to say, of ejection of Devills by Conjuration) is
 20546	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthereupon built; and (though rarely and faintly practised) is not yet
 20547	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttotally given over. That there were many Daemoniaques in the Primitive
 20548	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChurch, and few Mad-men, and other such singular diseases; whereas in
 20549	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthese times we hear of, and see many Mad-men, and few Daemoniaques,
 20550	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tproceeds not from the change of Nature; but of Names. But how it comes
 20551	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto passe, that whereas heretofore the Apostles, and after them for a
 20552	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttime, the Pastors of the Church, did cure those singular Diseases, which
 20553	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnow they are not seen to doe; as likewise, why it is not in the power of
 20554	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tevery true Beleever now, to doe all that the Faithfull did then, that is
 20555	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto say, as we read (Mark 16. 17.) "In Christs name to cast out Devills,
 20556	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto speak with new Tongues, to take up Serpents, to drink deadly Poison
 20557	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twithout harm taking, and to cure the Sick by the laying on of their
 20558	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thands," and all this without other words, but "in the Name of Jesus,"
 20559	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis another question. And it is probable, that those extraordinary gifts
 20560	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere given to the Church, for no longer a time, than men trusted wholly
 20561	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto Christ, and looked for their felicity onely in his Kingdome to come;
 20562	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand consequently, that when they sought Authority, and Riches, and
 20563	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttrusted to their own Subtilty for a Kingdome of this world, these
 20564	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsupernaturall gifts of God were again taken from them.

 20569	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnother Relique Of Gentilisme, Worshipping Images, Left In The Church
 20570	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20571	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNot Brought Into It
 20572	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20573	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnother relique of Gentilisme, is the Worship of Images, neither
 20574	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinstituted by Moses in the Old, nor by Christ in the New Testament; nor
 20575	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tyet brought in from the Gentiles; but left amongst them, after they had
 20576	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgiven their names to Christ. Before our Saviour preached, it was the
 20577	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgenerall Religion of the Gentiles, to worship for Gods, those Apparences
 20578	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat remain in the Brain from the impression of externall Bodies upon
 20579	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe organs of their Senses, which are commonly called Ideas, Idols,
 20580	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPhantasmes, Conceits, as being Representations of those externall
 20581	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBodies, which cause them, and have nothing in them of reality, no more
 20582	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthan there is in the things that seem to stand before us in a Dream:
 20583	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd this is the reason why St. Paul says, "Wee know that an Idol is
 20584	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNothing:" Not that he thought that an Image of Metall, Stone, or Wood,
 20585	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas nothing; but that the thing which they honored, or feared in
 20586	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Image, and held for a God, was a meer Figment, without place,
 20587	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thabitation, motion, or existence, but in the motions of the Brain.
 20588	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd the worship of these with Divine Honour, is that which is in the
 20589	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tScripture called Idolatry, and Rebellion against God. For God being King
 20590	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Jews, and his Lieutenant being first Moses, and afterward the
 20591	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHigh Priest; if the people had been permitted to worship, and pray to
 20592	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tImages, (which are Representations of their own Fancies,) they had
 20593	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thad no farther dependence on the true God, of whom there can be no
 20594	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsimilitude; nor on his prime Ministers, Moses, and the High Priests;
 20595	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut every man had governed himself according to his own appetite, to the
 20596	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tutter eversion of the Common-wealth, and their own destruction for want
 20597	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Union. And therefore the first Law of God was, "They should not take
 20598	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor Gods, ALIENOS DEOS, that is, the Gods of other nations, but that
 20599	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tonely true God, who vouchsafed to commune with Moses, and by him to give
 20600	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem laws and directions, for their peace, and for their salvation
 20601	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom their enemies." And the second was, that "they should not make to
 20602	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthemselves any Image to Worship, of their own Invention." For it is the
 20603	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsame deposing of a King, to submit to another King, whether he be set up
 20604	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby a neighbour nation, or by our selves.

 20609	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnswer To Certain Seeming Texts For Images
 20610	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20611	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe places of Scripture pretended to countenance the setting up of
 20612	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tImages, to worship them; or to set them up at all in the places where
 20613	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod is worshipped, are First, two Examples; one of the Cherubins over
 20614	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Ark of God; the other of the Brazen Serpent: Secondly, some texts
 20615	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhereby we are commanded to worship certain Creatures for their relation
 20616	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto God; as to worship his Footstool: And lastly, some other texts, by
 20617	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich is authorized, a religious honoring of Holy things. But before I
 20618	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texamine the force of those places, to prove that which is pretended, I
 20619	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmust first explain what is to be understood by Worshipping, and what by
 20620	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tImages, and Idols.
 20621	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20622	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20623	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20624	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20625	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhat Is Worship
 20626	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20627	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tI have already shewn in the 20 Chapter of this Discourse, that to Honor,
 20628	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis to value highly the Power of any person: and that such value is
 20629	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmeasured, by our comparing him with others. But because there is nothing
 20630	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto be compared with God in Power; we Honor him not but Dishonour him
 20631	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby any Value lesse than Infinite. And thus Honor is properly of its own
 20632	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnature, secret, and internall in the heart. But the inward thoughts of
 20633	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen, which appeare outwardly in their words and actions, are the signes
 20634	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof our Honoring, and these goe by the name of WORSHIP, in Latine,
 20635	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCULTUS. Therefore, to Pray to, to Swear by, to Obey, to bee Diligent,
 20636	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Officious in Serving: in summe, all words and actions that betoken
 20637	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFear to Offend, or Desire to Please, is Worship, whether those words
 20638	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand actions be sincere, or feigned: and because they appear as signes of
 20639	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHonoring, are ordinarily also called Honor.
 20640	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20641	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20642	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20643	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20644	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDistinction Between Divine And Civill Worship
 20645	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20646	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Worship we exhibite to those we esteem to be but men, as to Kings,
 20647	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand men in Authority, is Civill Worship: But the worship we exhibite
 20648	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto that which we think to bee God, whatsoever the words, ceremonies,
 20649	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgestures, or other actions be, is Divine Worship. To fall prostrate
 20650	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbefore a King, in him that thinks him but a Man, is but Civill Worship:
 20651	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd he that but putteth off his hat in the Church, for this cause, that
 20652	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the thinketh it the House of God, worshippeth with Divine Worship. They
 20653	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat seek the distinction of Divine and Civill Worship, not in the
 20654	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tintention of the Worshipper, but in the Words douleia, and latreia,
 20655	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdeceive themselves. For whereas there be two sorts of Servants; that
 20656	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsort, which is of those that are absolutely in the power of their
 20657	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMasters, as Slaves taken in war, and their Issue, whose bodies are not
 20658	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin their own power, (their lives depending on the Will of their Masters,
 20659	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin such manner as to forfeit them upon the least disobedience,) and that
 20660	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare bought and sold as Beasts, were called Douloi, that is properly,
 20661	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSlaves, and their Service, Douleia: The other, which is of those that
 20662	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tserve (for hire, or in hope of benefit from their Masters) voluntarily;
 20663	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare called Thetes; that is, Domestique Servants; to whose service the
 20664	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMasters have no further right, than is contained in the Covenants made
 20665	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbetwixt them. These two kinds of Servants have thus much common to them
 20666	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tboth, that their labour is appointed them by another, whether, as a
 20667	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSlave, or a voluntary Servant: And the word Latris, is the general name
 20668	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof both, signifying him that worketh for another, whether, as a Slave,
 20669	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor a voluntary Servant: So that Latreia signifieth generally all
 20670	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tService; but Douleia the service of Bondmen onely, and the condition of
 20671	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSlavery: And both are used in Scripture (to signifie our Service of God)
 20672	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpromiscuously. Douleia, because we are Gods Slaves; Latreia, because
 20673	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twee Serve him: and in all kinds of Service is contained, not onely
 20674	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tObedience, but also Worship, that is, such actions, gestures, and words,
 20675	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas signifie Honor.

 20679	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20680	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAn Image What Phantasmes
 20681	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20682	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAn IMAGE (in the most strict signification of the word) is the
 20683	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tResemblance of some thing visible: In which sense the Phantasticall
 20684	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFormes, Apparitions, or Seemings of Visible Bodies to the Sight, are
 20685	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tonely Images; such as are the Shew of a man, or other thing in the
 20686	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWater, by Reflexion, or Refraction; or of the Sun, or Stars by Direct
 20687	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tVision in the Air; which are nothing reall in the things seen, nor in
 20688	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe place where thy seem to bee; nor are their magnitudes and figures
 20689	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe same with that of the object; but changeable, by the variation of
 20690	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe organs of Sight, or by glasses; and are present oftentimes in our
 20691	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tImagination, and in our Dreams, when the object is absent; or changed
 20692	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinto other colours, and shapes, as things that depend onely upon the
 20693	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFancy. And these are the Images which are originally and most properly
 20694	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcalled Ideas, and IDOLS, and derived from the language of the Graecians,
 20695	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith whom the word Eido signifieth to See. They are also called
 20696	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPHANTASMES, which is in the same language, Apparitions. And from these
 20697	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tImages it is that one of the faculties of mans Nature, is called the
 20698	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tImagination. And from hence it is manifest, that there neither is, nor
 20699	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcan bee any Image made of a thing Invisible.
 20700	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20701	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIt is also evident, that there can be no Image of a thing Infinite: for
 20702	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall the Images, and Phantasmes that are made by the Impression of things
 20703	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tvisible, are figured: but Figure is a quantity every way determined: And
 20704	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore there can bee no Image of God: nor of the Soule of Man; nor of
 20705	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSpirits, but onely of Bodies Visible, that is, Bodies that have light in
 20706	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthemselves, or are by such enlightened.
 20707	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20708	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20709	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20710	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20711	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFictions; Materiall Images
 20712	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20713	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd whereas a man can fancy Shapes he never saw; making up a Figure out
 20714	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the parts of divers creatures; as the Poets make their Centaures,
 20715	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChimaeras, and other Monsters never seen: So can he also give Matter to
 20716	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose Shapes, and make them in Wood, Clay or Metall. And these are also
 20717	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcalled Images, not for the resemblance of any corporeall thing, but for
 20718	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe resemblance of some Phantasticall Inhabitants of the Brain of the
 20719	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMaker. But in these Idols, as they are originally in the Brain, and
 20720	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas they are painted, carved, moulded, or moulten in matter, there is a
 20721	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsimilitude of the one to the other, for which the Materiall Body made
 20722	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby Art, may be said to be the Image of the Phantasticall Idoll made by
 20723	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNature.
 20724	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20725	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut in a larger use of the word Image, is contained also, any
 20726	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRepresentation of one thing by another. So an earthly Soveraign may be
 20727	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcalled the Image of God: And an inferiour Magistrate the Image of an
 20728	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tearthly Soveraign. And many times in the Idolatry of the Gentiles there
 20729	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas little regard to the similitude of their Materiall Idoll to the
 20730	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIdol in their fancy, and yet it was called the Image of it. For a
 20731	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tStone unhewn has been set up for Neptune, and divers other shapes far
 20732	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdifferent from the shapes they conceived of their Gods. And at this
 20733	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tday we see many Images of the Virgin Mary, and other Saints, unlike one
 20734	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tanother, and without correspondence to any one mans Fancy; and yet serve
 20735	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twell enough for the purpose they were erected for; which was no more but
 20736	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby the Names onely, to represent the Persons mentioned in the History;
 20737	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto which every man applyeth a Mentall Image of his owne making, or
 20738	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnone at all. And thus an Image in the largest sense, is either the
 20739	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tResemblance, or the Representation of some thing Visible; or both
 20740	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttogether, as it happeneth for the most part.
 20741	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20742	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut the name of Idoll is extended yet further in Scripture, to
 20743	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsignifie also the Sunne, or a Starre, or any other Creature, visible or
 20744	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinvisible, when they are worshipped for Gods.

 20749	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIdolatry What
 20750	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20751	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHaving shewn what is Worship, and what an Image; I will now put them
 20752	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttogether, and examine what that IDOLATRY is, which is forbidden in the
 20753	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSecond Commandement, and other places of the Scripture.
 20754	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20755	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo worship an Image, is voluntarily to doe those externall acts, which
 20756	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare signes of honoring either the matter of the Image, which is Wood,
 20757	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tStone, or Metall, or some other visible creature; or the Phantasme of
 20758	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe brain, for the resemblance, or representation whereof, the matter
 20759	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas formed and figured; or both together, as one animate Body, composed
 20760	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Matter and the Phantasme, as of a Body and Soule.
 20761	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20762	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo be uncovered, before a man of Power and Authority, or before the
 20763	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThrone of a Prince, or in such other places as hee ordaineth to that
 20764	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpurpose in his absence, is to Worship that man, or Prince with Civill
 20765	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWorship; as being a signe, not of honoring the stoole, or place, but the
 20766	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPerson; and is not Idolatry. But if hee that doth it, should suppose the
 20767	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoule of the Prince to be in the Stool, or should present a Petition to
 20768	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Stool, it were Divine Worship, and Idolatry.
 20769	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20770	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo pray to a King for such things, as hee is able to doe for us, though
 20771	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twe prostrate our selves before him, is but Civill Worship; because we
 20772	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tacknowledge no other power in him, but humane: But voluntarily to pray
 20773	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunto him for fair weather, or for any thing which God onely can doe
 20774	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor us, is Divine Worship, and Idolatry. On the other side, if a King
 20775	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcompell a man to it by the terrour of Death, or other great corporall
 20776	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpunishment, it is not Idolatry: For the Worship which the Soveraign
 20777	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommandeth to bee done unto himself by the terrour of his Laws, is not
 20778	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta sign that he that obeyeth him, does inwardly honour him as a God, but
 20779	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat he is desirous to save himselfe from death, or from a miserable
 20780	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlife; and that which is not a sign of internall honor, is no Worship;
 20781	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand therefore no Idolatry. Neither can it bee said, that hee that does
 20782	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit, scandalizeth, or layeth any stumbling block before his Brother;
 20783	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbecause how wise, or learned soever he be that worshippeth in that
 20784	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmanner, another man cannot from thence argue, that he approveth it; but
 20785	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat he doth it for fear; and that it is not his act, but the act of the
 20786	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign.
 20787	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20788	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo worship God, in some peculiar Place, or turning a mans face towards
 20789	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tan Image, or determinate Place, is not to worship, or honor the Place,
 20790	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor Image; but to acknowledge it Holy, that is to say, to acknowledge
 20791	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Image, or the Place to be set apart from common use: for that is the
 20792	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmeaning of the word Holy; which implies no new quality in the Place, or
 20793	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tImage; but onely a new Relation by Appropriation to God; and therefore
 20794	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis not Idolatry; no more than it was Idolatry to worship God before
 20795	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Brazen Serpent; or for the Jews when they were out of their owne
 20796	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcountrey, to turn their faces (when they prayed) toward the Temple of
 20797	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJerusalem; or for Moses to put off his Shoes when he was before the
 20798	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFlaming Bush, the ground appertaining to Mount Sinai; which place God
 20799	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thad chosen to appear in, and to give his Laws to the People of Israel,
 20800	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand was therefore Holy ground, not by inhaerent sanctity, but by
 20801	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tseparation to Gods use; or for Christians to worship in the Churches,
 20802	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich are once solemnly dedicated to God for that purpose, by the
 20803	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAuthority of the King, or other true Representant of the Church. But to
 20804	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tworship God, is inanimating, or inhibiting, such Image, or place; that
 20805	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis to say, an infinite substance in a finite place, is Idolatry: for
 20806	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch finite Gods, are but Idols of the brain, nothing reall; and are
 20807	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommonly called in the Scripture by the names of Vanity, and Lyes, and
 20808	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNothing. Also to worship God, not as inanimating, or present in the
 20809	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tplace, or Image; but to the end to be put in mind of him, or of some
 20810	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tworks of his, in case the Place, or Image be dedicated, or set up
 20811	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby private authority, and not by the authority of them that are our
 20812	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign Pastors, is Idolatry. For the Commandement is, "Thou shalt not
 20813	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmake to thy selfe any graven image." God commanded Moses to set up the
 20814	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBrazen Serpent; hee did not make it to himselfe; it was not therefore
 20815	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagainst the Commandement. But the making of the Golden Calfe by Aaron,
 20816	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand the People, as being done without authority from God, was Idolatry;
 20817	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot onely because they held it for God, but also because they made it
 20818	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor a Religious use, without warrant either from God their Soveraign, or
 20819	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom Moses, that was his Lieutenant.
 20820	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20821	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Gentiles worshipped for Gods, Jupiter, and others; that living, were
 20822	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen perhaps that had done great and glorious Acts; and for the Children
 20823	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof God, divers men and women, supposing them gotten between an Immortall
 20824	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDeity, and a mortall man. This was Idolatry, because they made them so
 20825	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto themselves, having no authority from God, neither in his eternall Law
 20826	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Reason, nor in his positive and revealed Will. But though our Saviour
 20827	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas a man, whom wee also beleeve to bee God Immortall, and the Son of
 20828	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod; yet this is no Idolatry; because wee build not that beleef upon
 20829	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tour own fancy, or judgment, but upon the Word of God revealed in the
 20830	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tScriptures. And for the adoration of the Eucharist, if the words of
 20831	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChrist, "This is my Body," signifie, "that he himselfe, and the seeming
 20832	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbread in his hand; and not onely so, but that all the seeming morsells
 20833	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof bread that have ever since been, and any time hereafter shall bee
 20834	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsecrated by Priests, bee so many Christs bodies, and yet all of them
 20835	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut one body," then is that no Idolatry, because it is authorized by our
 20836	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSaviour: but if that text doe not signifie that, (for there is no other
 20837	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat can be alledged for it,) then, because it is a worship of humane
 20838	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinstitution, it is Idolatry. For it is not enough to say, God can
 20839	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttransubstantiate the Bread into Christs Body: For the Gentiles also held
 20840	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod to be Omnipotent; and might upon that ground no lesse excuse their
 20841	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIdolatry, by pretending, as well as others, as transubstantiation of
 20842	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir Wood, and Stone into God Almighty.
 20843	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20844	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhereas there be, that pretend Divine Inspiration, to be a supernaturall
 20845	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tentring of the Holy Ghost into a man, and not an acquisition of Gods
 20846	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgrace, by doctrine, and study; I think they are in a very dangerous
 20847	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDilemma. For if they worship not the men whom they beleeve to be so
 20848	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinspired, they fall into Impiety; as not adoring Gods supernaturall
 20849	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPresence. And again, if they worship them, they commit Idolatry; for the
 20850	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tApostles would never permit themselves to be so worshipped. Therefore
 20851	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe safest way is to beleeve, that by the Descending of the Dove upon
 20852	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Apostles; and by Christs Breathing on them, when hee gave them
 20853	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Holy Ghost; and by the giving of it by Imposition of Hands, are
 20854	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunderstood the signes which God hath been pleased to use, or ordain to
 20855	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe used, of his promise to assist those persons in their study to
 20856	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPreach his Kingdome, and in their Conversation, that it might not be
 20857	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tScandalous, but Edifying to others.

 20859	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20860	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20861	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20862	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tScandalous Worship Of Images
 20863	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20864	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBesides the Idolatrous Worship of Images, there is also a Scandalous
 20865	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWorship of them; which is also a sin; but not Idolatry. For Idolatry is
 20866	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto worship by signes of an internall, and reall honour: but Scandalous
 20867	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWorship, is but Seeming Worship; and may sometimes bee joined with
 20868	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tan inward, and hearty detestation, both of the Image, and of the
 20869	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPhantasticall Daemon, or Idol, to which it is dedicated; and proceed
 20870	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tonely from the fear of death, or other grievous punishment; and is
 20871	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tneverthelesse a sin in them that so worship, in case they be men whose
 20872	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tactions are looked at by others, as lights to guide them by; because
 20873	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfollowing their ways, they cannot but stumble, and fall in the way of
 20874	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tReligion: Whereas the example of those we regard not, works not on us
 20875	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tat all, but leaves us to our own diligence and caution; and consequently
 20876	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare no causes of our falling.
 20877	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20878	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIf therefore a Pastor lawfully called to teach and direct others, or any
 20879	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother, of whose knowledge there is a great opinion, doe externall honor
 20880	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto an Idol for fear; unlesse he make his feare, and unwillingnesse to
 20881	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit, as evident as the worship; he Scandalizeth his Brother, by seeming
 20882	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto approve Idolatry. For his Brother, arguing from the action of his
 20883	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tteacher, or of him whose knowledge he esteemeth great, concludes it
 20884	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto bee lawfull in it selfe. And this Scandall, is Sin, and a Scandall
 20885	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgiven. But if one being no Pastor, nor of eminent reputation for
 20886	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tknowledge in Christian Doctrine, doe the same, and another follow him;
 20887	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis is no Scandall given; for he had no cause to follow such example:
 20888	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut is a pretence of Scandall which hee taketh of himselfe for an excuse
 20889	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbefore men: For an unlearned man, that is in the power of an idolatrous
 20890	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKing, or State, if commanded on pain of death to worship before an
 20891	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIdoll, hee detesteth the Idoll in his heart, hee doth well; though if he
 20892	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thad the fortitude to suffer death, rather than worship it, he should
 20893	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdoe better. But if a Pastor, who as Christs Messenger, has undertaken to
 20894	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tteach Christs Doctrine to all nations, should doe the same, it were
 20895	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot onely a sinfull Scandall, in respect of other Christian mens
 20896	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsciences, but a perfidious forsaking of his charge.
 20897	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20898	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe summe of that which I have said hitherto, concerning the Worship of
 20899	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tImages, is that, that he that worshippeth in an Image, or any Creature,
 20900	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teither the Matter thereof, or any Fancy of his own, which he thinketh
 20901	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto dwell in it; or both together; or beleeveth that such things hear
 20902	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this Prayers, or see his Devotions, without Ears, or Eyes, committeth
 20903	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIdolatry: and he that counterfeiteth such Worship for fear of
 20904	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpunishment, if he bee a man whose example hath power amongst his
 20905	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBrethren, committeth a sin: But he that worshippeth the Creator of the
 20906	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tworld before such an Image, or in such a place as he hath not made, or
 20907	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tchosen of himselfe, but taken from the commandement of Gods Word, as the
 20908	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJewes did in worshipping God before the Cherubins, and before the Brazen
 20909	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSerpent for a time, and in, or towards the Temple of Jerusalem, which
 20910	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas also but for a time, committeth not Idolatry.
 20911	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20912	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNow for the Worship of Saints, and Images, and Reliques, and other
 20913	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthings at this day practised in the Church of Rome, I say they are not
 20914	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tallowed by the Word of God, not brought into the Church of Rome, from
 20915	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Doctrine there taught; but partly left in it at the first conversion
 20916	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Gentiles; and afterwards countenanced, and confirmed, and
 20917	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\taugmented by the Bishops of Rome.
 20918	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20919	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20920	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20921	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20922	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnswer To The Argument From The Cherubins, And Brazen Serpent
 20923	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20924	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAs for the proofs alledged out of Scripture, namely, those examples
 20925	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Images appointed by God to bee set up; They were not set up for the
 20926	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpeople, or any man to worship; but that they should worship God himselfe
 20927	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbefore them: as before the Cherubins over the Ark, and the Brazen
 20928	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSerpent. For we read not, that the Priest, or any other did worship the
 20929	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCherubins; but contrarily wee read (2 Kings 18.4.) that Hezekiah brake
 20930	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin pieces the Brazen Serpent which Moses had set up, because the
 20931	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPeople burnt incense to it. Besides, those examples are not put for
 20932	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tour Imitation, that we also should set up Images, under pretence
 20933	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof worshipping God before them; because the words of the second
 20934	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommandement, "Thou shalt not make to thy selfe any graven Image, &c."
 20935	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdistinguish between the Images that God commanded to be set up, and
 20936	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose which wee set up to our selves. And therefore from the Cherubins,
 20937	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor Brazen Serpent, to the Images of mans devising; and from the Worship
 20938	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommanded by God, to the Will-Worship of men, the argument is not good.
 20939	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThis also is to bee considered, that as Hezekiah brake in pieces the
 20940	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBrazen Serpent, because the Jews did worship it, to the end they should
 20941	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdoe so no more; so also Christian Soveraigns ought to break down the
 20942	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tImages which their Subjects have been accustomed to worship; that there
 20943	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe no more occasion of such Idolatry. For at this day, the ignorant
 20944	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPeople, where Images are worshipped, doe really beleeve there is a
 20945	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDivine Power in the Images; and are told by their Pastors, that some
 20946	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof them have spoken; and have bled; and that miracles have been done by
 20947	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem; which they apprehend as done by the Saint, which they think either
 20948	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis the Image it self, or in it. The Israelites, when they worshipped the
 20949	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCalfe, did think they worshipped the God that brought them out of Egypt;
 20950	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand yet it was Idolatry, because they thought the Calfe either was
 20951	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat God, or had him in his belly. And though some man may think it
 20952	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\timpossible for people to be so stupid, as to think the Image to be
 20953	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod, or a Saint; or to worship it in that notion; yet it is manifest
 20954	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin Scripture to the contrary; where when the Golden Calfe was made, the
 20955	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpeople said, (Exod. 32. 2.) "These are thy Gods O Israel;" and where the
 20956	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tImages of Laban (Gen. 31.30.) are called his Gods. And wee see daily by
 20957	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texperience in all sorts of People, that such men as study nothing but
 20958	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir food and ease, are content to beleeve any absurdity, rather than
 20959	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto trouble themselves to examine it; holding their faith as it were by
 20960	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tentaile unalienable, except by an expresse and new Law.

 20964	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20965	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPainting Of Fancies No Idolatry: Abusing Them To Religious Worship Is
 20966	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20967	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut they inferre from some other places, that it is lawfull to paint
 20968	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAngels, and also God himselfe: as from Gods walking in the Garden; from
 20969	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJacobs seeing God at the top of the ladder; and from other Visions, and
 20970	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDreams. But Visions, and Dreams whether naturall, or supernaturall, are
 20971	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut Phantasmes: and he that painteth an Image of any of them, maketh not
 20972	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tan Image of God, but of his own Phantasm, which is, making of an Idol. I
 20973	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsay not, that to draw a Picture after a fancy, is a Sin; but when it
 20974	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis drawn, to hold it for a Representation of God, is against the second
 20975	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommandement; and can be of no use, but to worship. And the same may be
 20976	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsaid of the Images of Angels, and of men dead; unlesse as Monuments of
 20977	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfriends, or of men worthy remembrance: For such use of an Image, is not
 20978	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWorship of the Image; but a civill honoring of the Person, not that is,
 20979	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut that was: But when it is done to the Image which we make of a Saint,
 20980	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor no other reason, but that we think he heareth our prayers, and is
 20981	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpleased with the honour wee doe him, when dead, and without sense, wee
 20982	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tattribute to him more than humane power; and therefore it is Idolatry.
 20983	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 20984	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSeeing therefore there is no authority, neither in the Law of Moses,
 20985	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnor in the Gospel, for the religious Worship of Images, or other
 20986	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRepresentations of God, which men set up to themselves; or for the
 20987	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWorship of the Image of any Creature in Heaven, or Earth, or under the
 20988	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEarth: And whereas Christian Kings, who are living Representants of God,
 20989	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare not to be worshipped by their Subjects, by any act, that signifieth
 20990	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta greater esteem of his power, than the nature of mortall man is capable
 20991	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof; It cannot be imagined, that the Religious Worship now in use,
 20992	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas brought into the Church, by misunderstanding of the Scripture. It
 20993	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tresteth therefore, that it was left in it, by not destroying the Images
 20994	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthemselves, in the conversion of the Gentiles that worshipped them.

 20999	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHow Idolatry Was Left In The Church
 21000	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 21001	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe cause whereof, was the immoderate esteem, and prices set upon the
 21002	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tworkmanship of them, which made the owners (though converted, from
 21003	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tworshipping them as they had done Religiously for Daemons) to retain
 21004	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem still in their houses, upon pretence of doing it in the honor of
 21005	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChrist, of the Virgin Mary, and of the Apostles, and other the Pastors
 21006	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Primitive Church; as being easie, by giving them new names, to
 21007	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmake that an Image of the Virgin Mary, and of her Sonne our Saviour,
 21008	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich before perhaps was called the Image of Venus, and Cupid; and so of
 21009	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Jupiter to make a Barnabas, and of Mercury a Paul, and the like. And
 21010	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas worldly ambition creeping by degrees into the Pastors, drew them to
 21011	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tan endeavour of pleasing the new made Christians; and also to a liking
 21012	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof this kind of honour, which they also might hope for after their
 21013	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdecease, as well as those that had already gained it: so the worshipping
 21014	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Images of Christ and his Apostles, grow more and more Idolatrous;
 21015	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsave that somewhat after the time of Constantine, divers Emperors, and
 21016	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBishops, and generall Councells observed, and opposed the unlawfulnesse

 21023	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 21024	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Canonizing of Saints, is another Relique of Gentilisme: It is
 21025	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tneither a misunderstanding of Scripture, nor a new invention of the
 21026	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRoman Church, but a custome as ancient as the Common-wealth of Rome it
 21027	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tself. The first that ever was canonized at Rome, was Romulus, and that
 21028	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tupon the narration of Julius Proculus, that swore before the Senate,
 21029	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the spake with him after his death, and was assured by him, he dwelt in
 21030	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHeaven, and was there called Quirinius, and would be propitious to
 21031	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe State of their new City: And thereupon the Senate gave Publique
 21032	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTestimony of his Sanctity. Julius Caesar, and other Emperors after him,
 21033	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thad the like Testimony; that is, were Canonized for Saints; now defined;
 21034	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand is the same with the Apotheosis of the Heathen.

 21039	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Name Of Pontifex
 21040	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 21041	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIt is also from the Roman Heathen, that the Popes have received the
 21042	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tname, and power of PONTIFEX MAXIMUS. This was the name of him that in
 21043	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe ancient Common-wealth of Rome, had the Supreme Authority under
 21044	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Senate and People, of regulating all Ceremonies, and Doctrines
 21045	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconcerning their Religion: And when Augustus Caesar changed the State
 21046	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinto a Monarchy, he took to himselfe no more but this office, and that
 21047	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Tribune of the People, (than is to say, the Supreme Power both in
 21048	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tState, and Religion;) and the succeeding Emperors enjoyed the same. But
 21049	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhen the Emperour Constantine lived, who was the first that professed
 21050	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand authorized Christian Religion, it was consonant to his profession,
 21051	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto cause Religion to be regulated (under his authority) by the Bishop
 21052	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Rome: Though it doe not appear they had so soon the name of Pontifex;
 21053	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut rather, that the succeeding Bishops took it of themselves, to
 21054	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcountenance the power they exercised over the Bishops of the Roman
 21055	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tProvinces. For it is not any Priviledge of St. Peter, but the Priviledge
 21056	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the City of Rome, which the Emperors were alwaies willing to uphold;
 21057	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat gave them such authority over other Bishops; as may be evidently
 21058	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tseen by that, that the Bishop of Constantinople, when the Emperour made
 21059	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat City the Seat of the Empire, pretended to bee equall to the Bishop
 21060	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Rome; though at last, not without contention, the Pope carryed it,
 21061	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand became the Pontifex Maximus; but in right onely of the Emperour; and
 21062	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot without the bounds of the Empire; nor any where, after the Emperour
 21063	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thad lost his power in Rome; though it were the Pope himself that took
 21064	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this power from him. From whence wee may by the way observe, that there
 21065	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis no place for the superiority of the Pope over other Bishops, except
 21066	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the territories whereof he is himself the Civill Soveraign; and where
 21067	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Emperour having Soveraign Power Civill, hath expressely chosen the
 21068	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPope for the chief Pastor under himselfe, of his Christian Subjects.

 21074	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 21075	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe carrying about of Images in Procession, is another Relique of the
 21076	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tReligion of the Greeks, and Romans: For they also carried their
 21077	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIdols from place to place, in a kind of Chariot, which was peculiarly
 21078	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdedicated to that use, which the Latines called Thensa, and Vehiculum
 21079	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDeorum; and the Image was placed in a frame, or Shrine, which they
 21080	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcalled Ferculum: And that which they called Pompa, is the same that
 21081	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnow is named Procession: According whereunto, amongst the Divine Honors
 21082	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich were given to Julius Caesar by the Senate, this was one, that in
 21083	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Pompe (or Procession) at the Circaean games, he should have Thensam
 21084	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t& Ferculum, a sacred Chariot, and a Shrine; which was as much, as to be
 21085	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcarried up and down as a God: Just as at this day the Popes are carried
 21086	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby Switzers under a Canopie.

 21092	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 21093	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo these Processions also belonged the bearing of burning Torches, and
 21094	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCandles, before the Images of the Gods, both amongst the Greeks, and
 21095	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRomans. For afterwards the Emperors of Rome received the same honor; as
 21096	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twe read of Caligula, that at his reception to the Empire, he was carried
 21097	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom Misenum to Rome, in the midst of a throng of People, the wayes
 21098	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeset with Altars, and Beasts for Sacrifice, and burning Torches: And
 21099	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Caracalla that was received into Alexandria with Incense, and with
 21100	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcasting of Flowers, and Dadouchiais, that is, with Torches; for Dadochoi
 21101	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere they that amongst the Greeks carried Torches lighted in the
 21102	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tProcessions of their Gods: And in processe of time, the devout, but
 21103	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tignorant People, did many times honor their Bishops with the like
 21104	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpompe of Wax Candles, and the Images of our Saviour, and the Saints,
 21105	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconstantly, in the Church it self. And thus came in the use of Wax
 21106	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCandles; and was also established by some of the ancient Councells.
 21107	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 21108	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Heathens had also their Aqua Lustralis, that is to say, Holy Water.
 21109	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Church of Rome imitates them also in their Holy Dayes. They had
 21110	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir Bacchanalia; and we have our Wakes, answering to them: They
 21111	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir Saturnalia, and we our Carnevalls, and Shrove-tuesdays liberty
 21112	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Servants: They their Procession of Priapus; wee our fetching in,
 21113	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\terection, and dancing about May-poles; and Dancing is one kind of
 21114	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWorship: They had their Procession called Ambarvalia; and we our
 21115	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tProcession about the fields in the Rogation Week. Nor do I think that
 21116	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthese are all the Ceremonies that have been left in the Church, from the
 21117	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfirst conversion of the Gentiles: but they are all that I can for the
 21118	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpresent call to mind; and if a man would wel observe that which is
 21119	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdelivered in the Histories, concerning the Religious Rites of the Greeks
 21120	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Romanes, I doubt not but he might find many more of these old empty
 21121	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBottles of Gentilisme, which the Doctors of the Romane Church, either
 21122	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby Negligence, or Ambition, have filled up again with the new Wine of

 21133	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 21134	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBy Philosophy is understood "the Knowledge acquired by Reasoning, from
 21135	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Manner of the Generation of any thing, to the Properties; or from
 21136	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Properties, to some possible Way of Generation of the same; to the
 21137	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tend to bee able to produce, as far as matter, and humane force permit,
 21138	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch Effects, as humane life requireth." So the Geometrician, from the
 21139	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConstruction of Figures, findeth out many Properties thereof; and from
 21140	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Properties, new Ways of their Construction, by Reasoning; to the end
 21141	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto be able to measure Land and Water; and for infinite other uses. So
 21142	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Astronomer, from the Rising, Setting, and Moving of the Sun, and
 21143	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tStarres, in divers parts of the Heavens, findeth out the Causes of Day,
 21144	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Night, and of the different Seasons of the Year; whereby he keepeth
 21145	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tan account of Time: And the like of other Sciences.

 21153	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpart thereof, that originall knowledge called Experience, in which
 21154	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsisteth Prudence: Because it is not attained by Reasoning, but found
 21155	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas well in Brute Beasts, as in Man; and is but a Memory of successions
 21156	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof events in times past, wherein the omission of every little

 21158	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmost Prudent: whereas nothing is produced by Reasoning aright, but

 21189	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf The Beginnings And Progresse Of Philosophy
 21190	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 21191	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe faculty of Reasoning being consequent to the use of Speech, it was
 21192	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot possible, but that there should have been some generall Truthes
 21193	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfound out by Reasoning, as ancient almost as Language it selfe. The
 21194	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSavages of America, are not without some good Morall Sentences; also
 21195	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey have a little Arithmetick, to adde, and divide in Numbers not too
 21196	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgreat: but they are not therefore Philosophers. For as there were Plants
 21197	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Corn and Wine in small quantity dispersed in the Fields and Woods,
 21198	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbefore men knew their vertue, or made use of them for their nourishment,
 21199	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor planted them apart in Fields, and Vineyards; in which time they
 21200	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfed on Akorns, and drank Water: so also there have been divers true,
 21201	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgenerall, and profitable Speculations from the beginning; as being the
 21202	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnaturall plants of humane Reason: But they were at first but few in
 21203	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnumber; men lived upon grosse Experience; there was no Method; that is
 21204	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto say, no Sowing, nor Planting of Knowledge by it self, apart from the
 21205	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWeeds, and common Plants of Errour and Conjecture: And the cause of it
 21206	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeing the want of leasure from procuring the necessities of life, and
 21207	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdefending themselves against their neighbours, it was impossible, till
 21208	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe erecting of great Common-wealths, it should be otherwise. Leasure
 21209	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis the mother of Philosophy; and Common-wealth, the mother of Peace, and
 21210	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLeasure: Where first were great and flourishing Cities, there was first
 21211	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe study of Philosophy. The Gymnosophists of India, the Magi of Persia,
 21212	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand the Priests of Chaldea and Egypt, are counted the most ancient
 21213	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPhilosophers; and those Countreys were the most ancient of Kingdomes.
 21214	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPhilosophy was not risen to the Graecians, and other people of the West,
 21215	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhose Common-wealths (no greater perhaps then Lucca, or Geneva) had
 21216	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnever Peace, but when their fears of one another were equall; nor the
 21217	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLeasure to observe any thing but one another. At length, when Warre had
 21218	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunited many of these Graecian lesser Cities, into fewer, and greater;
 21219	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthen began Seven Men, of severall parts of Greece, to get the reputation
 21220	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof being Wise; some of them for Morall and Politique Sentences; and
 21221	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tothers for the learning of the Chaldeans and Egyptians, which was

 21236	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpubliquely to the youth of the City. Every Master took some place for
 21237	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat purpose. Plato in certaine publique Walks called Academia, from one
 21238	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAcademus: Aristotle in the Walk of the Temple of Pan, called Lycaeum:
 21239	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tothers in the Stoa, or covered Walk, wherein the Merchants Goods were
 21240	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbrought to land: others in other places; where they spent the time of
 21241	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir Leasure, in teaching or in disputing of their Opinions: and some
 21242	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin any place, where they could get the youth of the City together to
 21243	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thear them talk. And this was it which Carneades also did at Rome, when
 21244	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the was Ambassadour: which caused Cato to advise the Senate to dispatch
 21245	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim quickly, for feare of corrupting the manners of the young men that
 21246	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdelighted to hear him speak (as they thought) fine things.
 21247	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 21248	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFrom this it was, that the place where any of them taught, and disputed,
 21249	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas called Schola, which in their Tongue signifieth Leasure; and their
 21250	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDisputations, Diatribae, that is to say, Passing of The Time. Also the
 21251	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPhilosophers themselves had the name of their Sects, some of them from
 21252	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthese their Schools: For they that followed Plato's Doctrine, were
 21253	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcalled Academiques; The followers of Aristotle, Peripatetiques, from the
 21254	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWalk hee taught in; and those that Zeno taught, Stoiques, from the Stoa:
 21255	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas if we should denominate men from More-fields, from Pauls-Church, and
 21256	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom the Exchange, because they meet there often, to prate and loyter.

 21258	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNeverthelesse, men were so much taken with this custome, that in time
 21259	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit spread it selfe over all Europe, and the best part of Afrique; so as
 21260	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere were Schools publiquely erected, and maintained for Lectures, and

 21267	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 21268	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThere were also Schools, anciently, both before, and after the time of
 21269	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tour Saviour, amongst the Jews: but they were Schools of their Law. For
 21270	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthough they were called Synagogues, that is to say, Congregations of the
 21271	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPeople; yet in as much as the Law was every Sabbath day read, expounded,
 21272	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand disputed in them, they differed not in nature, but in name onely
 21273	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom Publique Schools; and were not onely in Jerusalem, but in every
 21274	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCity of the Gentiles, where the Jews inhabited. There was such a Schoole
 21275	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tat Damascus, whereinto Paul entred, to persecute. There were others at
 21276	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAntioch, Iconium and Thessalonica, whereinto he entred, to dispute:
 21277	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd such was the Synagogue of the Libertines, Cyrenians, Alexandrians,
 21278	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCilicians, and those of Asia; that is to say, the Schoole of Libertines,
 21279	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand of Jewes, that were strangers in Jerusalem: And of this Schoole they

 21287	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut what has been the Utility of those Schools? what Science is there
 21288	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tat this day acquired by their Readings and Disputings? That wee have
 21289	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Geometry, which is the Mother of all Naturall Science, wee are not
 21290	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tindebted for it to the Schools. Plato that was the best Philosopher
 21291	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Greeks, forbad entrance into his Schoole, to all that were not
 21292	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talready in some measure Geometricians. There were many that studied that
 21293	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tScience to the great advantage of mankind: but there is no mention of
 21294	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir Schools; nor was there any Sect of Geometricians; nor did they
 21295	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthen passe under the name of Philosophers. The naturall Philosophy
 21296	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof those Schools, was rather a Dream than Science, and set forth in
 21297	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsenselesse and insignificant Language; which cannot be avoided by
 21298	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthose that will teach Philosophy, without having first attained great
 21299	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tknowledge in Geometry: For Nature worketh by Motion; the Wayes,
 21300	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Degrees whereof cannot be known, without the knowledge of the
 21301	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tProportions and Properties of Lines, and Figures. Their Morall
 21302	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPhilosophy is but a description of their own Passions. For the rule of
 21303	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tManners, without Civill Government, is the Law of Nature; and in it,
 21304	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Law Civill; that determineth what is Honest, and Dishonest; what is
 21305	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJust, and Unjust; and generally what is Good, and Evill: whereas they
 21306	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmake the Rules of Good, and Bad, by their own Liking, and Disliking: By
 21307	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich means, in so great diversity of taste, there is nothing generally
 21308	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagreed on; but every one doth (as far as he dares) whatsoever seemeth
 21309	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgood in his own eyes, to the subversion of Common-wealth. Their Logique
 21310	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich should bee the Method of Reasoning, is nothing else but Captions
 21311	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Words, and Inventions how to puzzle such as should goe about to pose
 21312	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem. To conclude there is nothing so absurd, that the old Philosophers
 21313	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(as Cicero saith, who was one of them) have not some of them maintained.
 21314	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd I beleeve that scarce any thing can be more absurdly said
 21315	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin naturall Philosophy, than that which now is called Aristotles
 21316	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMetaphysiques, nor more repugnant to Government, than much of that hee
 21317	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thath said in his Politiques; nor more ignorantly, than a great part of

 21325	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Schoole of the Jews, was originally a Schoole of the Law of Moses;
 21326	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twho commanded (Deut. 31.10.) that at the end of every seventh year, at
 21327	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Feast of the Tabernacles, it should be read to all the people, that
 21328	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey might hear, and learn it: Therefore the reading of the Law (which
 21329	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas in use after the Captivity) every Sabbath day, ought to have had
 21330	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tno other end, but the acquainting of the people with the Commandements
 21331	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich they were to obey, and to expound unto them the writings of the
 21332	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tProphets. But it is manifest, by the many reprehensions of them by
 21333	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tour Saviour, that they corrupted the Text of the Law with their
 21334	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfalse Commentaries, and vain Traditions; and so little understood the
 21335	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tProphets, that they did neither acknowledge Christ, nor the works he
 21336	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdid; for which the Prophets prophecyed. So that by their Lectures and
 21337	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDisputations in their Synagogues, they turned the Doctrine of their Law
 21338	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinto a Phantasticall kind of Philosophy, concerning the incomprehensible
 21339	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnature of God, and of Spirits; which they compounded of the Vain
 21340	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPhilosophy and Theology of the Graecians, mingled with their own
 21341	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfancies, drawn from the obscurer places of the Scripture, and which

 21350	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThat which is now called an University, is a Joyning together, and an
 21351	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIncorporation under one Government of many Publique Schools, in one and
 21352	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe same Town or City. In which, the principal Schools were ordained for
 21353	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe three Professions, that is to say, of the Romane Religion, of the
 21354	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRomane Law, and of the Art of Medicine. And for the study of Philosophy
 21355	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit hath no otherwise place, then as a handmaid to the Romane Religion:
 21356	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd since the Authority of Aristotle is onely current there, that
 21357	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tstudy is not properly Philosophy, (the nature whereof dependeth not on
 21358	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAuthors,) but Aristotelity. And for Geometry, till of very late times it
 21359	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thad no place at all; as being subservient to nothing but rigide Truth.
 21360	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd if any man by the ingenuity of his owne nature, had attained to any

 21370	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Universities, and thence into the Church, partly from Aristotle,
 21371	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpartly from Blindnesse of understanding; I shall first consider their
 21372	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPrinciples. There is a certain Philosophia Prima, on which all other
 21373	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPhilosophy ought to depend; and consisteth principally, in right
 21374	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlimiting of the significations of such Appellations, or Names, as are
 21375	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof all others the most Universall: Which Limitations serve to avoid
 21376	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tambiguity, and aequivocation in Reasoning; and are commonly called
 21377	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDefinitions; such as are the Definitions of Body, Time, Place, Matter,
 21378	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tForme, Essence, Subject, Substance, Accident, Power, Act, Finite,
 21379	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInfinite, Quantity, Quality, Motion, Action, Passion, and divers others,
 21380	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnecessary to the explaining of a mans Conceptions concerning the Nature
 21381	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Generation of Bodies. The Explication (that is, the setling of the
 21382	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmeaning) of which, and the like Terms, is commonly in the Schools called
 21383	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMetaphysiques; as being a part of the Philosophy of Aristotle, which
 21384	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thath that for title: but it is in another sense; for there it signifieth
 21385	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas much, as "Books written, or placed after his naturall Philosophy:"
 21386	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut the Schools take them for Books Of Supernaturall Philosophy: for the
 21387	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tword Metaphysiques will bear both these senses. And indeed that which is
 21388	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthere written, is for the most part so far from the possibility of being
 21389	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunderstood, and so repugnant to naturall Reason, that whosoever
 21390	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthinketh there is any thing to bee understood by it, must needs think it
 21391	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsupernaturall.

 21396	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tErrors Concerning Abstract Essences
 21397	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 21398	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFrom these Metaphysiques, which are mingled with the Scripture to make
 21399	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSchoole Divinity, wee are told, there be in the world certaine
 21400	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEssences separated from Bodies, which they call Abstract Essences, and
 21401	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSubstantiall Formes: For the Interpreting of which Jargon, there is
 21402	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tneed of somewhat more than ordinary attention in this place. Also I
 21403	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\task pardon of those that are not used to this kind of Discourse, for
 21404	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tapplying my selfe to those that are. The World, (I mean not the Earth
 21405	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tonely, that denominates the Lovers of it Worldly Men, but the Universe,
 21406	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat is, the whole masse of all things that are) is Corporeall, that
 21407	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis to say, Body; and hath the dimensions of Magnitude, namely, Length,
 21408	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBredth, and Depth: also every part of Body, is likewise Body, and hath
 21409	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe like dimensions; and consequently every part of the Universe,
 21410	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis Body, and that which is not Body, is no part of the Universe: And
 21411	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbecause the Universe is all, that which is no part of it, is Nothing;
 21412	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand consequently No Where. Nor does it follow from hence, that Spirits
 21413	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare Nothing: for they have dimensions, and are therefore really Bodies;
 21414	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthough that name in common Speech be given to such Bodies onely, as are
 21415	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tvisible, or palpable; that is, that have some degree of Opacity: But for
 21416	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSpirits, they call them Incorporeall; which is a name of more honour,
 21417	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand may therefore with more piety bee attributed to God himselfe; in
 21418	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhom wee consider not what Attribute expresseth best his Nature, which
 21419	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis Incomprehensible; but what best expresseth our desire to honour him.
 21420	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 21421	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo know now upon what grounds they say there be Essences Abstract, or
 21422	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSubstantiall Formes, wee are to consider what those words do properly
 21423	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsignifie. The use of Words, is to register to our selves, and make
 21424	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmanifest to others the Thoughts and Conceptions of our Minds. Of which
 21425	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWords, some are the names of the Things conceived; as the names of all
 21426	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsorts of Bodies, that work upon the Senses, and leave an Impression in
 21427	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Imagination: Others are the names of the Imaginations themselves;
 21428	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat is to say, of those Ideas, or mentall Images we have of all things
 21429	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twee see, or remember: And others againe are names of Names; or of
 21430	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdifferent sorts of Speech: As Universall, Plurall, Singular, Negation,
 21431	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTrue, False, Syllogisme, Interrogation, Promise, Covenant, are the names
 21432	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof certain Forms of Speech. Others serve to shew the Consequence, or
 21433	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRepugnance of one name to another; as when one saith, "A Man is a Body,"
 21434	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thee intendeth that the name of Body is necessarily consequent to the
 21435	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tname of Man; as being but severall names of the same thing, Man; which
 21436	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConsequence is signified by coupling them together with the word Is.
 21437	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd as wee use the Verbe Is; so the Latines use their Verbe Est, and
 21438	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Greeks their Esti through all its Declinations. Whether all other
 21439	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNations of the world have in their severall languages a word that
 21440	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tanswereth to it, or not, I cannot tell; but I am sure they have not need
 21441	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof it: For the placing of two names in order may serve to signifie their
 21442	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConsequence, if it were the custome, (for Custome is it, that give words
 21443	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir force,) as well as the words Is, or Bee, or Are, and the like.
 21444	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 21445	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd if it were so, that there were a Language without any Verb
 21446	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tanswerable to Est, or Is, or Bee; yet the men that used it would bee
 21447	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot a jot the lesse capable of Inferring, Concluding, and of all kind of
 21448	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tReasoning, than were the Greeks, and Latines. But what then would become
 21449	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof these Terms, of Entity, Essence, Essentiall, Essentially, that are
 21450	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tderived from it, and of many more that depend on these, applyed as most
 21451	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcommonly they are? They are therefore no Names of Things; but Signes, by
 21452	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich wee make known, that wee conceive the Consequence of one name or
 21453	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAttribute to another: as when we say, "a Man, is, a living Body," wee
 21454	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmean not that the Man is one thing, the Living Body another, and the Is,
 21455	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor Beeing a third: but that the Man, and the Living Body, is the same
 21456	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthing: because the Consequence, "If hee bee a Man, hee is a living
 21457	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBody," is a true Consequence, signified by that word Is. Therefore, to
 21458	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbee a Body, to Walke, to bee Speaking, to Live, to See, and the like
 21459	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInfinitives; also Corporeity, Walking, Speaking, Life, Sight, and the
 21460	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlike, that signifie just the same, are the names of Nothing; as I have
 21461	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\telsewhere more amply expressed.
 21462	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 21463	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut to what purpose (may some man say) is such subtilty in a work of
 21464	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis nature, where I pretend to nothing but what is necessary to the
 21465	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdoctrine of Government and Obedience? It is to this purpose, that men
 21466	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmay no longer suffer themselves to be abused, by them, that by this
 21467	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdoctrine of Separated Essences, built on the Vain Philosophy of
 21468	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAristotle, would fright them from Obeying the Laws of their Countrey,
 21469	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith empty names; as men fright Birds from the Corn with an empty
 21470	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdoublet, a hat, and a crooked stick. For it is upon this ground, that
 21471	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhen a Man is dead and buried, they say his Soule (that is his Life) can
 21472	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twalk separated from his Body, and is seen by night amongst the graves.
 21473	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tUpon the same ground they say, that the Figure, and Colour, and Tast of
 21474	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta peece of Bread, has a being, there, where they say there is no Bread:
 21475	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd upon the same ground they say, that Faith, and Wisdome, and other
 21476	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tVertues are sometimes powred into a man, sometimes blown into him from
 21477	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHeaven; as if the Vertuous, and their Vertues could be asunder; and a
 21478	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgreat many other things that serve to lessen the dependance of Subjects
 21479	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ton the Soveraign Power of their Countrey. For who will endeavour to obey
 21480	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Laws, if he expect Obedience to be Powred or Blown into him? Or who

 21484	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom him? And this shall suffice for an example of the Errors, which are
 21485	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbrought into the Church, from the Entities, and Essences of Aristotle:
 21486	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich it may be he knew to be false Philosophy; but writ it as a thing
 21487	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsonant to, and corroborative of their Religion; and fearing the fate
 21488	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Socrates.
 21489	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 21490	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBeing once fallen into this Error of Separated Essences, they are
 21491	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthereby necessarily involved in many other absurdities that follow it.
 21492	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor seeing they will have these Forms to be reall, they are obliged to
 21493	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tassign them some place. But because they hold them Incorporeall, without
 21494	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall dimension of Quantity, and all men know that Place is Dimension, and
 21495	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot to be filled, but by that which is Corporeall; they are driven to
 21496	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tuphold their credit with a distinction, that they are not indeed any
 21497	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhere Circumscriptive, but Definitive: Which Terms being meer Words, and
 21498	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin this occasion insignificant, passe onely in Latine, that the vanity
 21499	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof them may bee concealed. For the Circumscription of a thing, is
 21500	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnothing else but the Determination, or Defining of its Place; and so
 21501	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tboth the Terms of the Distinction are the same. And in particular, of
 21502	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Essence of a Man, which (they say) is his Soule, they affirm it,
 21503	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto be All of it in his little Finger, and All of it in every other Part
 21504	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(how small soever) of his Body; and yet no more Soule in the Whole Body,
 21505	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthan in any one of those Parts. Can any man think that God is served
 21506	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith such absurdities? And yet all this is necessary to beleeve,
 21507	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto those that will beleeve the Existence of an Incorporeall Soule,
 21508	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSeparated from the Body.
 21509	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 21510	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd when they come to give account, how an Incorporeall Substance can
 21511	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe capable of Pain, and be tormented in the fire of Hell, or Purgatory,
 21512	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey have nothing at all to answer, but that it cannot be known how fire
 21513	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcan burn Soules.
 21514	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 21515	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAgain, whereas Motion is change of Place, and Incorporeall Substances
 21516	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare not capable of Place, they are troubled to make it seem possible,
 21517	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thow a Soule can goe hence, without the Body to Heaven, Hell, or
 21518	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPurgatory; and how the Ghosts of men (and I may adde of their clothes
 21519	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich they appear in) can walk by night in Churches, Church-yards, and
 21520	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother places of Sepulture. To which I know not what they can answer,
 21521	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunlesse they will say, they walke Definitive, not Circumscriptive, or
 21522	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSpiritually, not Temporally: for such egregious distinctions are equally

 21550	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave us beleeve, that by the Almighty power of God, one body may be at

 21554	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeen. And these are but a small part of the Incongruities they are
 21555	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tforced to, from their disputing Philosophically, in stead of admiring,

 21557	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcannot signifie what he is, but ought to signifie our desire to honour

 21576	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdownwards toward the Earth, and others goe naturally from it; The
 21577	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSchools will tell you out of Aristotle, that the bodies that sink
 21578	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdownwards, are Heavy; and that this Heavinesse is it that causes them to
 21579	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdescend: But if you ask what they mean by Heavinesse, they will define
 21580	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit to bee an endeavour to goe to the center of the Earth: so that the
 21581	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcause why things sink downward, is an Endeavour to be below: which is

 21682	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaw but their own Appetites, there can be no generall Rule of Good, and
 21683	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEvill Actions. But in a Common-wealth this measure is false: Not the
 21684	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAppetite of Private men, but the Law, which is the Will and Appetite of
 21685	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe State is the measure. And yet is this Doctrine still practised; and
 21686	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen judge the Goodnesse, or Wickednesse of their own, and of other mens

 21689	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\town eyes, without any regard at all to the Publique Laws; except onely
 21690	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMonks, and Friers, that are bound by Vow to that simple obedience to

 21704	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe ground of denying Marriage to the Clergy. For they confesse it is

 21706	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOrders that continually attend the Altar, and administration of the
 21707	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEucharist, a continuall Abstinence from women, under the name of
 21708	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontinuall Chastity, Continence, and Purity. Therefore they call the
 21709	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlawfull use of Wives, want of Chastity, and Continence; and so make
 21710	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMarriage a Sin, or at least a thing so impure, and unclean, as to render
 21711	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta man unfit for the Altar. If the Law were made because the use of Wives
 21712	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis Incontinence, and contrary to Chastity, then all marriage is vice; If
 21713	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbecause it is a thing too impure, and unclean for a man consecrated to
 21714	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod; much more should other naturall, necessary, and daily works which

 21720	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPhilosophy; nor yet upon the preference of single life, to the estate of

 21724	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcountrey to another, to be clogged with the care of wife and children;
 21725	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut upon the design of the Popes, and Priests of after times, to make
 21726	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthemselves the Clergy, that is to say, sole Heirs of the Kingdome of God
 21727	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin this world; to which it was necessary to take from them the use of

 21730	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshall bee as the Angels in heaven;" that is to say, Spirituall. Seeing
 21731	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthen they had taken on them the name of Spirituall, to have allowed

 21744	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthem, the thirty Tyrants: As also to call the condition of the people
 21745	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunder the Democracy, Liberty. A Tyrant originally signified no more
 21746	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsimply, but a Monarch: But when afterwards in most parts of Greece that
 21747	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tkind of government was abolished, the name began to signifie, not onely
 21748	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe thing it did before, but with it, the hatred which the Popular
 21749	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tStates bare towards it: As also the name of King became odious after the
 21750	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdeposing of the Kings in Rome, as being a thing naturall to all men,
 21751	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto conceive some great Fault to be signified in any Attribute, that is
 21752	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgiven in despight, and to a great Enemy. And when the same men shall be
 21753	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdispleased with those that have the administration of the Democracy,
 21754	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor Aristocracy, they are not to seek for disgraceful names to expresse
 21755	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir anger in; but call readily the one Anarchy, and the other
 21756	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOligarchy, or the Tyranny Of A Few. And that which offendeth the People,
 21757	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis no other thing, but that they are governed, not as every one of them
 21758	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twould himselfe, but as the Publique Representant, be it one Man, or an
 21759	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAssembly of men thinks fit; that is, by an Arbitrary government: for
 21760	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich they give evill names to their Superiors; never knowing (till
 21761	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tperhaps a little after a Civill warre) that without such Arbitrary
 21762	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgovernment, such Warre must be perpetuall; and that it is Men, and Arms,
 21763	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot Words, and Promises, that make the Force and Power of the Laws.

 21769	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 21770	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd therefore this is another Errour of Aristotles Politiques, that in
 21771	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta wel ordered Common-wealth, not Men should govern, but the Laws. What
 21772	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman, that has his naturall Senses, though he can neither write nor read,
 21773	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdoes not find himself governed by them he fears, and beleeves can kill
 21774	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor hurt him when he obeyeth not? or that beleeves the Law can hurt him;
 21775	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat is, Words, and Paper, without the Hands, and Swords of men? And
 21776	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis is of the number of pernicious Errors: for they induce men, as oft
 21777	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas they like not their Governours, to adhaere to those that call them
 21778	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTyrants, and to think it lawfull to raise warre against them: And yet

 21786	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThere is another Errour in their Civill Philosophy (which they never

 21788	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\textend the power of the Law, which is the Rule of Actions onely, to the
 21789	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tvery Thoughts, and Consciences of men, by Examination, and Inquisition
 21790	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof what they Hold, notwithstanding the Conformity of their Speech and
 21791	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tActions: By which, men are either punished for answering the truth
 21792	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof their thoughts, or constrained to answer an untruth for fear of
 21793	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpunishment. It is true, that the Civill Magistrate, intending to employ
 21794	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta Minister in the charge of Teaching, may enquire of him, if hee bee
 21795	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontent to Preach such, and such Doctrines; and in case of refusall,
 21796	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmay deny him the employment: But to force him to accuse himselfe of
 21797	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOpinions, when his Actions are not by Law forbidden, is against the
 21798	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaw of Nature; and especially in them, who teach, that a man shall bee
 21799	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdamned to Eternall and extream torments, if he die in a false opinion
 21800	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconcerning an Article of the Christian Faith. For who is there, that

 21815	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcomprehended also the Power of Explaining them when there is need. And
 21816	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare not the Scriptures, in all places where they are Law, made Law by
 21817	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Authority of the Common-wealth, and consequently, a part of the

 21819	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 21820	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOf the same kind it is also, when any but the Soveraign restraineth in

 21822	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdo, that impropriate the Preaching of the Gospell to one certain Order
 21823	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof men, where the Laws have left it free. If the State give me leave to
 21824	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpreach, or teach; that is, if it forbid me not, no man can forbid me.
 21825	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIf I find my selfe amongst the Idolaters of America, shall I that am a
 21826	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChristian, though not in Orders, think it a sin to preach Jesus Christ,
 21827	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttill I have received Orders from Rome? or when I have preached, shall
 21828	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot I answer their doubts, and expound the Scriptures to them; that is

 21831	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMission; which is true: But this is true also, that for whatsoever,
 21832	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta dispensation is due for the necessity, for the same there needs no
 21833	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdispensation, when there is no Law that forbids it. Therefore to deny

 21875	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texamine Spirits, than in all things that concern the power of the Romane

 21945	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIs The Kingdome Of God, (that is, the Kingdome of Glory, or the Land of
 21946	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPromise; not the Kingdome of Grace, which is but a Promise of the
 21947	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLand,) are annexed these worldly Benefits, First, that the Pastors,
 21948	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Teachers of the Church, are entitled thereby, as Gods Publique
 21949	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMinisters, to a Right of Governing the Church; and consequently (because
 21950	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Church, and Common-wealth are the same Persons) to be Rectors, and
 21951	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGovernours of the Common-wealth. By this title it is, that the Pope
 21952	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprevailed with the subjects of all Christian Princes, to beleeve, that
 21953	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto disobey him, was to disobey Christ himselfe; and in all differences
 21954	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbetween him and other Princes, (charmed with the word Power Spirituall,)
 21955	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto abandon their lawfull Soveraigns; which is in effect an universall
 21956	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMonarchy over all Christendome. For though they were first invested in
 21957	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe right of being Supreme Teachers of Christian Doctrine, by, and
 21958	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunder Christian Emperors, within the limits of the Romane Empire (as is
 21959	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tacknowledged by themselves) by the title of Pontifex Maximus, who was an
 21960	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOfficer subject to the Civill State; yet after the Empire was divided,
 21961	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand dissolved, it was not hard to obtrude upon the people already
 21962	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsubject to them, another Title, namely, the Right of St. Peter; not
 21963	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tonely to save entire their pretended Power; but also to extend the same
 21964	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tover the same Christian Provinces, though no more united in the Empire
 21965	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Rome. This Benefit of an Universall Monarchy, (considering the desire
 21966	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof men to bear Rule) is a sufficient Presumption, that the popes that
 21967	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpretended to it, and for a long time enjoyed it, were the Authors of
 21968	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Doctrine, by which it was obtained; namely, that the Church now

 21973	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAfter that certain Churches had renounced this universall Power of the

 21978	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tadministred the Government of Religion, by maintaining their imployment
 21979	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto be in Gods Right, seemed to usurp, if not a Supremacy, yet an
 21980	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIndependency on the Civill Power: and they but seemed to usurp it, in

 21991	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis Doctrine, that the Kingdome of Christ is already come, and that it
 21992	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbegan at the Resurrection of our Saviour, was still retained. But Cui
 21993	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBono? What Profit did they expect from it? The same which the Popes
 21994	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texpected: to have a Soveraign Power over the People. For what is it for
 21995	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen to excommunicate their lawful King, but to keep him from all places
 21996	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Gods publique Service in his own Kingdom? and with force to resist

 21999	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tperson, but to take from him his Lawfull Liberty, that is, to usurpe
 22000	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tan unlawfull Power over their Brethren? The Authors therefore of this

 22010	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAs first, that the Pope In His Publique Capacity Cannot Erre. For who

 22018	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 22019	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSecondly, that all other Bishops, in what Common-wealth soever, have
 22020	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnot their Right, neither immediately from God, nor mediately from their
 22021	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCivill Soveraigns, but from the Pope, is a Doctrine, by which there
 22022	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcomes to be in every Christian Common-wealth many potent men, (for so
 22023	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare Bishops,) that have their dependance on the Pope, and owe obedience
 22024	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto him, though he be a forraign Prince; by which means he is able, (as
 22025	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the hath done many times) to raise a Civill War against the State
 22026	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat submits not it self to be governed according to his pleasure and

 22035	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMonkes, and Fryers, from the Power of the Civill Laws. For by this

 22051	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpublique Ministers, amongst the Jews, whilest God was their King. Also,
 22052	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe making the Lords Supper a Sacrifice, serveth to make the People

 22141	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 22142	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo these, if they sufficed not, might be added other of their dark
 22143	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDoctrines, the profit whereof redoundeth manifestly, to the setting up
 22144	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof an unlawfull Power over the lawfull Soveraigns of Christian People;
 22145	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor for the sustaining of the same, when it is set up; or to the worldly
 22146	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRiches, Honour, and Authority of those that sustain it. And therefore by
 22147	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe aforesaid rule, of Cui Bono, we may justly pronounce for the Authors
 22148	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof all this Spirituall Darknesse, the Pope, and Roman Clergy, and
 22149	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall those besides that endeavour to settle in the mindes of men this
 22150	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\terroneous Doctrine, that the Church now on Earth, is that Kingdome of
 22151	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGod mentioned in the Old and New Testament.
 22152	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 22153	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut the Emperours, and other Christian Soveraigns, under whose
 22154	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tGovernment these Errours, and the like encroachments of Ecclesiastiques
 22155	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tupon their Office, at first crept in, to the disturbance of their
 22156	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpossessions, and of the tranquillity of their Subjects, though they
 22157	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuffered the same for want of foresight of the Sequel, and of insight
 22158	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinto the designs of their Teachers, may neverthelesse bee esteemed
 22159	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\taccessories to their own, and the Publique dammage; For without
 22160	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir Authority there could at first no seditious Doctrine have been
 22161	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpubliquely preached. I say they might have hindred the same in the
 22162	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeginning: But when the people were once possessed by those spirituall
 22163	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen, there was no humane remedy to be applyed, that any man could
 22164	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinvent: And for the remedies that God should provide, who never faileth
 22165	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin his good time to destroy all the Machinations of men against the
 22166	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTruth, wee are to attend his good pleasure, that suffereth many times
 22167	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe prosperity of his enemies, together with their ambition, to grow
 22168	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto such a height, as the violence thereof openeth the eyes, which the
 22169	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twarinesse of their predecessours had before sealed up, and makes men
 22170	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tby too much grasping let goe all, as Peters net was broken, by the
 22171	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tstruggling of too great a multitude of Fishes; whereas the Impatience
 22172	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof those, that strive to resist such encroachment, before their Subjects
 22173	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\teyes were opened, did but encrease the power they resisted. I doe not
 22174	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore blame the Emperour Frederick for holding the stirrop to our
 22175	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcountryman Pope Adrian; for such was the disposition of his subjects
 22176	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthen, as if hee had not doe it, hee was not likely to have succeeded in
 22177	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Empire: But I blame those, that in the beginning, when their power
 22178	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas entire, by suffering such Doctrines to be forged in the Universities
 22179	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof their own Dominions, have holden the Stirrop to all the succeeding
 22180	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPopes, whilest they mounted into the Thrones of all Christian
 22181	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraigns, to ride, and tire, both them, and their people, at their
 22182	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpleasure.
 22183	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 22184	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBut as the Inventions of men are woven, so also are they ravelled out;
 22185	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe way is the same, but the order is inverted: The web begins at the
 22186	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfirst Elements of Power, which are Wisdom, Humility, Sincerity, and
 22187	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother vertues of the Apostles, whom the people converted, obeyed, out
 22188	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Reverence, not by Obligation: Their Consciences were free, and their
 22189	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWords and Actions subject to none but the Civill Power. Afterwards the
 22190	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPresbyters (as the Flocks of Christ encreased) assembling to consider
 22191	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhat they should teach, and thereby obliging themselves to teach nothing
 22192	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagainst the Decrees of their Assemblies, made it to be thought the
 22193	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpeople were thereby obliged to follow their Doctrine, and when
 22194	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey refused, refused to keep them company, (that was then called
 22195	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tExcommunication,) not as being Infidels, but as being disobedient: And
 22196	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis was the first knot upon their Liberty. And the number of Presbyters
 22197	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tencreasing, the Presbyters of the chief City or Province, got themselves
 22198	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tan authority over the parochiall Presbyters, and appropriated to
 22199	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthemselves the names of Bishops: And this was a second knot on Christian
 22200	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLiberty. Lastly, the Bishop of Rome, in regard of the Imperiall City,
 22201	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttook upon him an Authority (partly by the wills of the Emperours
 22202	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthemselves, and by the title of Pontifex Maximus, and at last when the
 22203	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEmperours were grown weak, by the priviledges of St. Peter) over all
 22204	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tother Bishops of the Empire: Which was the third and last knot, and the
 22205	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhole Synthesis and Construction of the Pontificall Power.
 22206	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 22207	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd therefore the Analysis, or Resolution is by the same way; but
 22208	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeginning with the knot that was last tyed; as wee may see in the
 22209	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdissolution of the praeterpoliticall Church Government in England.
 22210	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 22211	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFirst, the Power of the Popes was dissolved totally by Queen Elizabeth;
 22212	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand the Bishops, who before exercised their Functions in Right of the
 22213	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPope, did afterwards exercise the same in Right of the Queen and her
 22214	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSuccessours; though by retaining the phrase of Jure Divino, they were
 22215	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthought to demand it by immediate Right from God: And so was untyed the
 22216	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfirst knot. After this, the Presbyterians lately in England obtained the
 22217	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tputting down of Episcopacy: And so was the second knot dissolved:
 22218	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd almost at the same time, the Power was taken also from the
 22219	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPresbyterians: And so we are reduced to the Independency of the
 22220	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPrimitive Christians to follow Paul, or Cephas, or Apollos, every man
 22221	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas he liketh best: Which, if it be without contention, and without
 22222	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmeasuring the Doctrine of Christ, by our affection to the Person of his
 22223	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMinister, (the fault which the Apostle reprehended in the Corinthians,)
 22224	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis perhaps the best: First, because there ought to be no Power over the
 22225	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConsciences of men, but of the Word it selfe, working Faith in every
 22226	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tone, not alwayes according to the purpose of them that Plant and Water,
 22227	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut of God himself, that giveth the Increase: and secondly, because it
 22228	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis unreasonable in them, who teach there is such danger in every little
 22229	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tErrour, to require of a man endued with Reason of his own, to follow the
 22230	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tReason of any other man, or of the most voices of many other men; Which
 22231	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis little better, then to venture his Salvation at crosse and pile. Nor
 22232	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tought those Teachers to be displeased with this losse of their antient
 22233	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAuthority: For there is none should know better then they, that power is
 22234	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpreserved by the same Vertues by which it is acquired; that is to
 22235	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsay, by Wisdome, Humility, Clearnesse of Doctrine, and sincerity of
 22236	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConversation; and not by suppression of the Naturall Sciences, and
 22237	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Morality of Naturall Reason; nor by obscure Language; nor by
 22238	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tArrogating to themselves more Knowledge than they make appear; nor by
 22239	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPious Frauds; nor by such other faults, as in the Pastors of Gods Church
 22240	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare not only Faults, but also scandalls, apt to make men stumble one
 22241	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttime or other upon the suppression of their Authority.

 22249	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof God spoken of in the Old and New Testament," was received in
 22250	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe World; the ambition, and canvasing for the Offices that belong
 22251	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthereunto, and especially for that great Office of being Christs
 22252	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLieutenant, and the Pompe of them that obtained therein the principal
 22253	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPublique Charges, became by degrees so evident, that they lost the
 22254	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinward Reverence due to the Pastorall Function: in so much as the Wisest
 22255	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen, of them that had any power in the Civill State, needed nothing but
 22256	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe authority of their Princes, to deny them any further Obedience. For,
 22257	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom the time that the Bishop of Rome had gotten to be acknowledged for
 22258	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBishop Universall, by pretence of Succession to St. Peter, their whole
 22259	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tHierarchy, or Kingdome of Darknesse, may be compared not unfitly to
 22260	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Kingdome of Fairies; that is, to the old wives Fables in England,
 22261	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconcerning Ghosts and Spirits, and the feats they play in the night. And
 22262	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tif a man consider the originall of this great Ecclesiasticall Dominion,
 22263	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\the will easily perceive, that the Papacy, is no other, than the Ghost of
 22264	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe deceased Romane Empire, sitting crowned upon the grave thereof: For

 22268	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Language also, which they use, both in the Churches, and in their
 22269	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPublique Acts, being Latine, which is not commonly used by any Nation
 22270	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnow in the world, what is it but the Ghost of the Old Romane Language.
 22271	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 22272	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Fairies in what Nation soever they converse, have but one Universall
 22273	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tKing, which some Poets of ours call King Oberon; but the Scripture calls
 22274	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBeelzebub, Prince of Daemons. The Ecclesiastiques likewise, in whose
 22275	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDominions soever they be found, acknowledge but one Universall King, the
 22276	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPope.
 22277	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 22278	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Ecclesiastiques are Spirituall men, and Ghostly Fathers. The
 22279	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFairies are Spirits, and Ghosts. Fairies and Ghosts inhabite Darknesse,
 22280	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSolitudes, and Graves. The Ecclesiastiques walke in Obscurity of
 22281	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDoctrine, in Monasteries, Churches, and Churchyards.
 22282	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 22283	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Ecclesiastiques have their Cathedral Churches; which, in what Towne
 22284	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsoever they be erected, by vertue of Holy Water, and certain Charmes
 22285	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcalled Exorcismes, have the power to make those Townes, cities, that is
 22286	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto say, Seats of Empire. The Fairies also have their enchanted Castles,
 22287	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand certain Gigantique Ghosts, that domineer over the Regions round
 22288	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tabout them.
 22289	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 22290	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe fairies are not to be seized on; and brought to answer for the hurt
 22291	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey do. So also the Ecclesiastiques vanish away from the Tribunals of
 22292	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCivill Justice.
 22293	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 22294	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Ecclesiastiques take from young men, the use of Reason, by certain
 22295	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCharms compounded of Metaphysiques, and Miracles, and Traditions, and
 22296	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAbused Scripture, whereby they are good for nothing else, but to execute
 22297	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhat they command them. The Fairies likewise are said to take young
 22298	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tChildren out of their Cradles, and to change them into Naturall Fools,
 22299	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich Common people do therefore call Elves, and are apt to mischief.
 22300	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 22301	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn what Shop, or Operatory the Fairies make their Enchantment, the old
 22302	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWives have not determined. But the Operatories of the Clergy, are well
 22303	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tenough known to be the Universities, that received their Discipline from
 22304	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAuthority Pontificall.
 22305	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 22306	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhen the Fairies are displeased with any body, they are said to
 22307	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsend their Elves, to pinch them. The Ecclesiastiques, when they are
 22308	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdispleased with any Civill State, make also their Elves, that is,
 22309	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSuperstitious, Enchanted Subjects, to pinch their Princes, by preaching
 22310	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSedition; or one Prince enchanted with promises, to pinch another.
 22311	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 22312	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Fairies marry not; but there be amongst them Incubi, that have
 22313	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcopulation with flesh and bloud. The Priests also marry not.
 22314	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 22315	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Ecclesiastiques take the Cream of the Land, by Donations of ignorant
 22316	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen, that stand in aw of them, and by Tythes: So also it is in the Fable
 22317	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Fairies, that they enter into the Dairies, and Feast upon the Cream,
 22318	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich they skim from the Milk.
 22319	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 22320	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhat kind of Money is currant in the Kingdome of Fairies, is not
 22321	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trecorded in the Story. But the Ecclesiastiques in their Receipts accept
 22322	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the same Money that we doe; though when they are to make any Payment,
 22323	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit is in Canonizations, Indulgences, and Masses.
 22324	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 22325	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo this, and such like resemblances between the Papacy, and the Kingdome
 22326	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Fairies, may be added this, that as the Fairies have no existence,
 22327	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbut in the Fancies of ignorant people, rising from the Traditions of old
 22328	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWives, or old Poets: so the Spirituall Power of the Pope (without the
 22329	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbounds of his own Civill Dominion) consisteth onely in the Fear that
 22330	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSeduced people stand in, of their Excommunication; upon hearing of false
 22331	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMiracles, false Traditions, and false Interpretations of the Scripture.
 22332	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 22333	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIt was not therefore a very difficult matter, for Henry 8. by his
 22334	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tExorcisme; nor for Qu. Elizabeth by hers, to cast them out. But who
 22335	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tknows that this Spirit of Rome, now gone out, and walking by Missions
 22336	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthrough the dry places of China, Japan, and the Indies, that yeeld him
 22337	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlittle fruit, may not return, or rather an Assembly of Spirits worse
 22338	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthan he, enter, and inhabite this clean swept house, and make the End
 22339	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthereof worse than the beginning? For it is not the Romane Clergy onely,
 22340	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat pretends the Kingdome of God to be of this World, and thereby to
 22341	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave a Power therein, distinct from that of the Civill State. And
 22342	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthis is all I had a designe to say, concerning the Doctrine of the
 22343	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPOLITIQUES. Which when I have reviewed, I shall willingly expose it to
 22344	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe censure of my Countrey.

 22347	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 22348	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 22349	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tA REVIEW, AND CONCLUSION
 22350	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 22351	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 22352	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFrom the contrariety of some of the Naturall Faculties of the Mind, one
 22353	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto another, as also of one Passion to another, and from their reference
 22354	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto Conversation, there has been an argument taken, to inferre an
 22355	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\timpossibility that any one man should be sufficiently disposed to all
 22356	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsorts of Civill duty. The Severity of Judgment, they say, makes men
 22357	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCensorious, and unapt to pardon the Errours and Infirmities of other
 22358	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmen: and on the other side, Celerity of Fancy, makes the thoughts lesse
 22359	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsteddy than is necessary, to discern exactly between Right and Wrong.
 22360	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAgain, in all Deliberations, and in all Pleadings, the faculty of solid
 22361	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tReasoning, is necessary: for without it, the Resolutions of men are
 22362	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trash, and their Sentences unjust: and yet if there be not powerfull
 22363	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEloquence, which procureth attention and Consent, the effect of Reason
 22364	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twill be little. But these are contrary Faculties; the former being
 22365	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgrounded upon principles of Truth; the other upon Opinions already
 22366	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treceived, true, or false; and upon the Passions and Interests of men,
 22367	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhich are different, and mutable.
 22368	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 22369	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd amongst the Passions, Courage, (by which I mean the Contempt of
 22370	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWounds, and violent Death) enclineth men to private Revenges, and
 22371	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsometimes to endeavour the unsetling of the Publique Peace; And
 22372	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTimorousnesse, many times disposeth to the desertion of the Publique
 22373	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDefence. Both these they say cannot stand together in the same person.
 22374	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 22375	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd to consider the contrariety of mens Opinions, and Manners in
 22376	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgenerall, It is they say, impossible to entertain a constant Civill
 22377	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAmity with all those, with whom the Businesse of the world constrains
 22378	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tus to converse: Which Businesse consisteth almost in nothing else but a
 22379	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tperpetuall contention for Honor, Riches, and Authority.
 22380	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 22381	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo which I answer, that these are indeed great difficulties, but not
 22382	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tImpossibilities: For by Education, and Discipline, they may bee, and
 22383	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare sometimes reconciled. Judgment, and Fancy may have place in the
 22384	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsame man; but by turnes; as the end which he aimeth at requireth. As the
 22385	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIsraelites in Egypt, were sometimes fastened to their labour of making
 22386	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBricks, and other times were ranging abroad to gather Straw: So also may
 22387	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Judgment sometimes be fixed upon one certain Consideration, and
 22388	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Fancy at another time wandring about the world. So also Reason,
 22389	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Eloquence, (though not perhaps in the Naturall Sciences, yet in the
 22390	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMorall) may stand very well together. For wheresoever there is place for
 22391	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tadorning and preferring of Errour, there is much more place for adorning
 22392	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand preferring of Truth, if they have it to adorn. Nor is there any
 22393	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trepugnancy between fearing the Laws, and not fearing a publique Enemy;
 22394	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnor between abstaining from Injury, and pardoning it in others. There is
 22395	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore no such Inconsistence of Humane Nature, with Civill Duties,
 22396	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas some think. I have known cleernesse of Judgment, and largenesse of
 22397	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFancy; strength of Reason, and gracefull Elocution; a Courage for the
 22398	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWarre, and a Fear for the Laws, and all eminently in one man; and that
 22399	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas my most noble and honored friend Mr. Sidney Godolphin; who hating no
 22400	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tman, nor hated of any, was unfortunately slain in the beginning of the
 22401	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlate Civill warre, in the Publique quarrel, by an indiscerned, and an
 22402	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tundiscerning hand.
 22403	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 22404	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo the Laws of Nature, declared in the 15. Chapter, I would have this
 22405	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tadded, "That every man is bound by Nature, as much as in him lieth, to
 22406	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprotect in Warre, the Authority, by which he is himself protected in
 22407	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttime of Peace." For he that pretendeth a Right of Nature to preserve
 22408	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this owne body, cannot pretend a Right of Nature to destroy him, by whose
 22409	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tstrength he is preserved: It is a manifest contradiction of himselfe.
 22410	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd though this Law may bee drawn by consequence, from some of those
 22411	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat are there already mentioned; yet the Times require to have it
 22412	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinculcated, and remembred.
 22413	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 22414	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd because I find by divers English Books lately printed, that the
 22415	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCivill warres have not yet sufficiently taught men, in what point of
 22416	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttime it is, that a Subject becomes obliged to the Conquerour; nor what
 22417	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis Conquest; nor how it comes about, that it obliges men to obey his
 22418	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLaws: Therefore for farther satisfaction of men therein, I say, the
 22419	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpoint of time, wherein a man becomes subject of a Conquerour, is that
 22420	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpoint, wherein having liberty to submit to him, he consenteth, either by
 22421	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texpresse words, or by other sufficient sign, to be his Subject. When it
 22422	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tis that a man hath the liberty to submit, I have showed before in the
 22423	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tend of the 21. Chapter; namely, that for him that hath no obligation to
 22424	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this former Soveraign but that of an ordinary Subject, it is then, when
 22425	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe means of his life is within the Guards and Garrisons of the Enemy;
 22426	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor it is then, that he hath no longer Protection from him, but is
 22427	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprotected by the adverse party for his Contribution. Seeing
 22428	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttherefore such contribution is every where, as a thing inevitable,
 22429	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(notwithstanding it be an assistance to the Enemy,) esteemed lawfull;
 22430	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas totall Submission, which is but an assistance to the Enemy, cannot
 22431	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe esteemed unlawfull. Besides, if a man consider that they who submit,
 22432	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tassist the Enemy but with part of their estates, whereas they that
 22433	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\trefuse, assist him with the whole, there is no reason to call their
 22434	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSubmission, or Composition an Assistance; but rather a Detriment to the
 22435	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEnemy. But if a man, besides the obligation of a Subject, hath taken
 22436	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tupon him a new obligation of a Souldier, then he hath not the liberty
 22437	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto submit to a new Power, as long as the old one keeps the field, and
 22438	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgiveth him means of subsistence, either in his Armies, or Garrisons:
 22439	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor in this case, he cannot complain of want of Protection, and means to
 22440	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlive as a Souldier: But when that also failes, a Souldier also may seek
 22441	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\this Protection wheresoever he has most hope to have it; and may lawfully
 22442	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsubmit himself to his new Master. And so much for the Time when he may
 22443	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdo it lawfully, if hee will. If therefore he doe it, he is undoubtedly
 22444	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbound to be a true Subject: For a Contract lawfully made, cannot
 22445	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlawfully be broken.
 22446	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 22447	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tBy this also a man may understand, when it is, that men may be said to
 22448	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe Conquered; and in what the nature of Conquest, and the Right of a
 22449	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConquerour consisteth: For this Submission is it implyeth them all.
 22450	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tConquest, is not the Victory it self; but the Acquisition by Victory,
 22451	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof a Right, over the persons of men. He therefore that is slain, is
 22452	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tOvercome, but not Conquered; He that is taken, and put into prison, or
 22453	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tchaines, is not Conquered, though Overcome; for he is still an Enemy,
 22454	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand may save himself if hee can: But he that upon promise of Obedience,
 22455	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thath his Life and Liberty allowed him, is then Conquered, and a Subject;
 22456	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand not before. The Romanes used to say, that their Generall had
 22457	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPacified such a Province, that is to say, in English, Conquered it; and
 22458	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat the Countrey was Pacified by Victory, when the people of it
 22459	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thad promised Imperata Facere, that is, To Doe What The Romane People
 22460	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommanded Them: this was to be Conquered. But this promise may be either
 22461	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\texpresse, or tacite: Expresse, by Promise: Tacite, by other signes. As
 22462	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor example, a man that hath not been called to make such an expresse
 22463	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPromise, (because he is one whose power perhaps is not considerable;)
 22464	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tyet if he live under their Protection openly, hee is understood to
 22465	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsubmit himselfe to the Government: But if he live there secretly, he is
 22466	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlyable to any thing that may bee done to a Spie, and Enemy of the State.
 22467	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tI say not, hee does any Injustice, (for acts of open Hostility bear not
 22468	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat name); but that he may be justly put to death. Likewise, if a man,
 22469	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhen his Country is conquered, be out of it, he is not Conquered, nor
 22470	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSubject: but if at his return, he submit to the Government, he is bound
 22471	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto obey it. So that Conquest (to define it) is the Acquiring of the
 22472	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRight of Soveraignty by Victory. Which Right, is acquired, in the
 22473	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpeoples Submission, by which they contract with the Victor, promising
 22474	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tObedience, for Life and Liberty.
 22475	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 22476	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn the 29th Chapter I have set down for one of the causes of the
 22477	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDissolutions of Common-wealths, their Imperfect Generation, consisting
 22478	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin the want of an Absolute and Arbitrary Legislative Power; for want
 22479	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhereof, the Civill Soveraign is fain to handle the Sword of Justice
 22480	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tunconstantly, and as if it were too hot for him to hold: One reason
 22481	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhereof (which I have not there mentioned) is this, That they will all
 22482	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof them justifie the War, by which their Power was at first gotten,
 22483	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand whereon (as they think) their Right dependeth, and not on the
 22484	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPossession. As if, for example, the Right of the Kings of England did
 22485	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdepend on the goodnesse of the cause of William the Conquerour, and upon
 22486	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir lineall, and directest Descent from him; by which means, there
 22487	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twould perhaps be no tie of the Subjects obedience to their Soveraign
 22488	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tat this day in all the world: wherein whilest they needlessely think to
 22489	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tjustifie themselves, they justifie all the successefull Rebellions that
 22490	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAmbition shall at any time raise against them, and their Successors.
 22491	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTherefore I put down for one of the most effectuall seeds of the Death
 22492	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof any State, that the Conquerours require not onely a Submission of
 22493	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmens actions to them for the future, but also an Approbation of all
 22494	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir actions past; when there is scarce a Common-wealth in the world,
 22495	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhose beginnings can in conscience be justified.
 22496	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 22497	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd because the name of Tyranny, signifieth nothing more, nor lesse,
 22498	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthan the name of Soveraignty, be it in one, or many men, saving that
 22499	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey that use the former word, are understood to bee angry with them
 22500	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey call Tyrants; I think the toleration of a professed hatred of
 22501	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTyranny, is a Toleration of hatred to Common-wealth in general, and
 22502	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tanother evill seed, not differing much from the former. For to the
 22503	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tJustification of the Cause of a Conqueror, the Reproach of the Cause
 22504	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Conquered, is for the most part necessary: but neither of them
 22505	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnecessary for the Obligation of the Conquered. And thus much I have
 22506	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthought fit to say upon the Review of the first and second part of this
 22507	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDiscourse.
 22508	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 22509	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn the 35th Chapter, I have sufficiently declared out of the Scripture,
 22510	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat in the Common-wealth of the Jewes, God himselfe was made the
 22511	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraign, by Pact with the People; who were therefore called his
 22512	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPeculiar People, to distinguish them from the rest of the world, over
 22513	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhom God reigned not by their Consent, but by his own Power: And that
 22514	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin this Kingdome Moses was Gods Lieutenant on Earth; and that it was he
 22515	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat told them what Laws God appointed to doe Execution; especially
 22516	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin Capitall Punishments; not then thinking it a matter of so necessary
 22517	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsideration, as I find it since. Wee know that generally in all
 22518	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCommon-wealths, the Execution of Corporeall Punishments, was either put
 22519	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tupon the Guards, or other Souldiers of the Soveraign Power; or given
 22520	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto those, in whom want of means, contempt of honour, and hardnesse of
 22521	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\theart, concurred, to make them sue for such an Office. But amongst the
 22522	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIsraelites it was a Positive Law of God their Soveraign, that he that
 22523	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas convicted of a capitall Crime, should be stoned to death by the
 22524	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPeople; and that the Witnesses should cast the first Stone, and after
 22525	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Witnesses, then the rest of the People. This was a Law that designed
 22526	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twho were to be the Executioners; but not that any one should throw a
 22527	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tStone at him before Conviction and Sentence, where the Congregation
 22528	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twas Judge. The Witnesses were neverthelesse to be heard before they
 22529	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tproceeded to Execution, unlesse the Fact were committed in the presence
 22530	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Congregation it self, or in sight of the lawfull Judges; for
 22531	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthen there needed no other Witnesses but the Judges themselves.
 22532	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNeverthelesse, this manner of proceeding being not throughly understood,
 22533	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thath given occasion to a dangerous opinion, that any man may kill
 22534	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tanother, is some cases, by a Right of Zeal; as if the Executions done
 22535	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tupon Offenders in the Kingdome of God in old time, proceeded not from
 22536	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Soveraign Command, but from the Authority of Private Zeal: which, if
 22537	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twe consider the texts that seem to favour it, is quite contrary.
 22538	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 22539	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFirst, where the Levites fell upon the People, that had made and
 22540	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tworshipped the Golden Calfe, and slew three thousand of them; it was by
 22541	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Commandement of Moses, from the mouth of God; as is manifest, Exod.
 22542	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t32.27. And when the Son of a woman of Israel had blasphemed God, they
 22543	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat heard it, did not kill him, but brought him before Moses, who
 22544	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tput him under custody, till God should give Sentence against him; as
 22545	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tappears, Levit. 25.11, 12. Again, (Numbers 25.6, 7.) when Phinehas
 22546	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tkilled Zimri and Cosbi, it was not by right of Private Zeale: Their
 22547	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCrime was committed in the sight of the Assembly; there needed
 22548	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tno Witnesse; the Law was known, and he the heir apparent to the
 22549	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSoveraignty; and which is the principall point, the Lawfulnesse of his
 22550	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAct depended wholly upon a subsequent Ratification by Moses, whereof he
 22551	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thad no cause to doubt. And this Presumption of a future Ratification, is
 22552	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsometimes necessary to the safety [of] a Common-wealth; as in a sudden
 22553	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRebellion, any man that can suppresse it by his own Power in the
 22554	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCountrey where it begins, may lawfully doe it, and provide to have it
 22555	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tRatified, or Pardoned, whilest it is in doing, or after it is done. Also
 22556	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tNumb. 35.30. it is expressely said, "Whosoever shall kill the Murtherer,
 22557	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tshall kill him upon the word of Witnesses:" but Witnesses suppose
 22558	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta formall Judicature, and consequently condemn that pretence of Jus
 22559	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tZelotarum. The Law of Moses concerning him that enticeth to Idolatry,
 22560	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(that is to say, in the Kingdome of God to a renouncing of his
 22561	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAllegiance) (Deut. 13.8.) forbids to conceal him, and commands the
 22562	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAccuser to cause him to be put to death, and to cast the first stone at
 22563	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thim; but not to kill him before he be Condemned. And (Deut. 17. ver.4,
 22564	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t5, 6.) the Processe against Idolatry is exactly set down: For God there
 22565	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tspeaketh to the People, as Judge, and commandeth them, when a man is
 22566	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAccused of Idolatry, to Enquire diligently of the Fact, and finding it
 22567	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttrue, then to Stone him; but still the hand of the Witnesse throweth
 22568	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe first stone. This is not Private Zeal, but Publique Condemnation. In
 22569	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlike manner when a Father hath a rebellious Son, the Law is (Deut. 21.
 22570	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t18.) that he shall bring him before the Judges of the Town, and all the
 22571	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpeople of the Town shall Stone him. Lastly, by pretence of these Laws
 22572	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit was, that St. Steven was Stoned, and not by pretence of Private Zeal:
 22573	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor before hee was carried away to Execution, he had Pleaded his Cause
 22574	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbefore the High Priest. There is nothing in all this, nor in any other
 22575	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpart of the Bible, to countenance Executions by Private Zeal; which
 22576	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbeing oftentimes but a conjunction of Ignorance and Passion, is against
 22577	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tboth the Justice and Peace of a Common-wealth.
 22578	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 22579	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn the 36th Chapter I have said, that it is not declared in what
 22580	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmanner God spake supernaturally to Moses: Not that he spake not to him
 22581	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsometimes by Dreams and Visions, and by a supernaturall Voice, as
 22582	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto other Prophets: For the manner how he spake unto him from the
 22583	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tMercy-seat, is expressely set down (Numbers 7.89.) in these words,
 22584	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t"From that time forward, when Moses entred into the Tabernacle of the
 22585	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCongregation to speak with God, he heard a Voice which spake unto him
 22586	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom over the Mercy-Seate, which is over the Arke of the Testimony, from
 22587	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbetween the Cherubins he spake unto him." But it is not declared in
 22588	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhat consisted the praeeminence of the manner of Gods speaking to Moses,
 22589	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tabove that of his speaking to other Prophets, as to Samuel, and to
 22590	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAbraham, to whom he also spake by a Voice, (that is, by Vision) Unlesse
 22591	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe difference consist in the cleernesse of the Vision. For Face
 22592	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto Face, and Mouth to Mouth, cannot be literally understood of the
 22593	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInfinitenesse, and Incomprehensibility of the Divine Nature.
 22594	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 22595	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd as to the whole Doctrine, I see not yet, but the principles of
 22596	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit are true and proper; and the Ratiocination solid. For I ground the
 22597	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tCivill Right of Soveraigns, and both the Duty and Liberty of Subjects,
 22598	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tupon the known naturall Inclinations of Mankind, and upon the Articles
 22599	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof the Law of Nature; of which no man, that pretends but reason enough
 22600	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tto govern his private family, ought to be ignorant. And for the Power
 22601	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEcclesiasticall of the same Soveraigns, I ground it on such Texts, as
 22602	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tare both evident in themselves, and consonant to the Scope of the whole
 22603	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tScripture. And therefore am perswaded, that he that shall read it with
 22604	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ta purpose onely to be informed, shall be informed by it. But for those
 22605	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthat by Writing, or Publique Discourse, or by their eminent actions,
 22606	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave already engaged themselves to the maintaining of contrary opinions,
 22607	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthey will not bee so easily satisfied. For in such cases, it is naturall
 22608	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfor men, at one and the same time, both to proceed in reading, and to
 22609	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tlose their attention, in the search of objections to that they had read
 22610	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbefore: Of which, in a time wherein the interests of men are changed
 22611	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t(seeing much of that Doctrine, which serveth to the establishing of a
 22612	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnew Government, must needs be contrary to that which conduced to the
 22613	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdissolution of the old,) there cannot choose but be very many.
 22614	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 22615	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tIn that part which treateth of a Christian Common-wealth, there are
 22616	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsome new Doctrines, which, it may be, in a State where the contrary were
 22617	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\talready fully determined, were a fault for a Subject without leave to
 22618	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdivulge, as being an usurpation of the place of a Teacher. But in this
 22619	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttime, that men call not onely for Peace, but also for Truth, to offer
 22620	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch Doctrines as I think True, and that manifestly tend to Peace and
 22621	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tLoyalty, to the consideration of those that are yet in deliberation, is
 22622	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tno more, but to offer New Wine, to bee put into New Cask, that bothe may
 22623	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbe preserved together. And I suppose, that then, when Novelty can breed
 22624	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tno trouble, nor disorder in a State, men are not generally so much
 22625	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tinclined to the reverence of Antiquity, as to preferre Ancient Errors,
 22626	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbefore New and well proved Truth.
 22627	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 22628	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThere is nothing I distrust more than my Elocution; which neverthelesse
 22629	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tI am confident (excepting the Mischances of the Presse) is not obscure.
 22630	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThat I have neglected the Ornament of quoting ancient Poets, Orators,
 22631	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand Philosophers, contrary to the custome of late time, (whether I have
 22632	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdone well or ill in it,) proceedeth from my judgment, grounded on many
 22633	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treasons. For first, all Truth of Doctrine dependeth either upon Reason,
 22634	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tor upon Scripture; both which give credit to many, but never receive it
 22635	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfrom any Writer. Secondly, the matters in question are not of Fact, but
 22636	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof Right, wherein there is no place for Witnesses. There is scarce any
 22637	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof those old Writers, that contradicteth not sometimes both himself,
 22638	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tand others; which makes their Testimonies insufficient. Fourthly,
 22639	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tsuch Opinions as are taken onely upon Credit of Antiquity, are not
 22640	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tintrinsically the Judgment of those that cite them, but Words that
 22641	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tpasse (like gaping) from mouth to mouth. Fiftly, it is many times with a
 22642	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfraudulent Designe that men stick their corrupt Doctrine with the Cloves
 22643	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tof other mens Wit. Sixtly, I find not that the Ancients they cite, took
 22644	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit for an Ornament, to doe the like with those that wrote before them.
 22645	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSeventhly, it is an argument of Indigestion, when Greek and Latine
 22646	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tSentences unchewed come up again, as they use to doe, unchanged. Lastly,
 22647	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthough I reverence those men of Ancient time, that either have written
 22648	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTruth perspicuously, or set us in a better way to find it out our
 22649	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tselves; yet to the Antiquity it self I think nothing due: For if we will
 22650	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\treverence the Age, the Present is the Oldest. If the Antiquity of the
 22651	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWriter, I am not sure, that generally they to whom such honor is given,
 22652	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twere more Ancient when they wrote, than I am that am Writing: But if it
 22653	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tbee well considered, the praise of Ancient Authors, proceeds not from
 22654	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe reverence of the Dead, but from the competition, and mutuall envy of
 22655	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Living.
 22656	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 22657	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tTo conclude, there is nothing in this whole Discourse, nor in that I
 22658	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twrit before of the same Subject in Latine, as far as I can perceive,
 22659	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcontrary either to the Word of God, or to good Manners; or to the
 22660	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdisturbance of the Publique Tranquillity. Therefore I think it may be
 22661	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tprofitably printed, and more profitably taught in the Universities, in
 22662	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcase they also think so, to whom the judgment of the same belongeth.
 22663	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tFor seeing the Universities are the Fountains of Civill, and Morall
 22664	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDoctrine, from whence the Preachers, and the Gentry, drawing such water
 22665	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas they find, use to sprinkle the same (both from the Pulpit, and in
 22666	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttheir Conversation) upon the People, there ought certainly to be
 22667	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tgreat care taken, to have it pure, both from the Venime of Heathen
 22668	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tPoliticians, and from the Incantation of Deceiving Spirits. And by that
 22669	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tmeans the most men, knowing their Duties, will be the less subject to
 22670	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tserve the Ambition of a few discontented persons, in their purposes
 22671	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tagainst the State; and be the lesse grieved with the Contributions
 22672	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tnecessary for their Peace, and Defence; and the Governours themselves
 22673	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave the lesse cause, to maintain at the Common charge any greater
 22674	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tArmy, than is necessary to make good the Publique Liberty, against the
 22675	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tInvasions and Encroachments of forraign Enemies.
 22676	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t
 22677	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tAnd thus I have brought to an end my Discourse of Civill and
 22678	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tEcclesiasticall Government, occasioned by the disorders of the present
 22679	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\ttime, without partiality, without application, and without other
 22680	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tdesigne, than to set before mens eyes the mutuall Relation between
 22681	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tProtection and Obedience; of which the condition of Humane Nature, and
 22682	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tthe Laws Divine, (both Naturall and Positive) require an inviolable
 22683	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tobservation. And though in the revolution of States, there can be no
 22684	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tvery good Constellation for Truths of this nature to be born under, (as
 22685	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thaving an angry aspect from the dissolvers of an old Government, and
 22686	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tseeing but the backs of them that erect a new;) yet I cannot think
 22687	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tit will be condemned at this time, either by the Publique Judge of
 22688	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tDoctrine, or by any that desires the continuance of Publique Peace. And
 22689	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tin this hope I return to my interrupted Speculation of Bodies Naturall;
 22690	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twherein, (if God give me health to finish it,) I hope the Novelty will
 22691	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tas much please, as in the Doctrine of this Artificiall Body it useth to
 22692	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\toffend. For such Truth, as opposeth no man profit, nor pleasure, is to
 22693	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tall men welcome.

 23014	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
 23015	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
 23016	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tarray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
 23017	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\t($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
 23018	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tstatus with the IRS.

 23020	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
 23021	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tcharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
 23022	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
 23023	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
 23024	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
 23025	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\twhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To

 23029	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\tWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
 23030	LeviathanbyThomasHobbes.txt\thave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
